        "title": "Over 96,290 Lives Lost In IIOJK As International Silence Prolongs - UrduPoint",
        "text": "ISLAMABAD, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 6th Feb, 2024) Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir is marred by decades of killings, arrests, disappearances and crackdowns at the hands of Indian occupation forces in a bid to crush the Kashmiri people's persistent struggle for right to self-determination, guaranteed by the United Nations.\n\nA comprehensive report released by the Kashmir Media Service, on Tuesday, removes the lid from the gravity of the deepening human rights crisis in the occupied territory. The figures speak volumes, with more than 96,290 Kashmiris, spanning across generations, having lost their lives since the eruption of the ongoing phase of resistance against India's illegal occupation in 1989.\n\nThe report sheds light on the relentless Indian state terrorism that continues to plague the territory. Atrocities, torture, cordon and search operations, house raids, and harassment have become a harrowing norm, rendering the lives of Kashmiris in a perpetual state of tragedy and trauma.\n\nThe situation has worsened since August 5, 2019, when the Modi-led Hindutva Indian government violated international laws by dividing IIOJK into two union territories and imposing a military siege.\n\nThis unprecedented siege has transformed IIOJK into the world's largest open-air prison, with the Kashmiri population enduring stifling conditions and severe restrictions on their daily lives.\n\nThe report raises a poignant question: For how long must Kashmiris face humiliation, and when will the international community break its silence. The right to live, the report asserts, is applicable to Kashmiris as well, and it implores the world to come to their rescue.\n\nIt strongly condemns the RSS-backed Hindutva government, blaming it for making the lives of Kashmiris a living hell. Modi's pursuit of a Hindutva agenda in IIOJK is claiming innocent lives in Kashmir where Muslims are targeted as victims of this ideology.\n\nThe report concludes by calling on the global community to recognize Kashmir not as an internal matter for India but as a pressing global issue.\n\nIt urges international pressure on India to end its brutal occupation of Kashmir, emphasizing the violation of international laws in the occupied territory. The figures presented in the report underscore the urgent need for collective action to address the alarming human toll in the occupied territory.",

        "title": "Air pollution a factor in spiking cancer cases, report says",
        "text": "GENEVA (AFP): New estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO) predict a 77% increase in cancer cases globally by 2050. The report points to air pollution as one of the factors driving the expected increase in cancer rates, even though it does not have the same effect on everyone.\n\nAs a global health watchdog, the WHO rarely has good news. It stayed true to its mission ahead of World Cancer Day, when its International Agency for Research on Cancer released a report on February 1 predicting an increase of some 35 million new cases of cancer by 2050. This represents an increase of 77% compared to 2022, noted WHO.\n\nAmong the factors driving the expected increase in cancer rates was air pollution.\n\nFine particles lead to cell dysfunction\n\n\"This mainly concerns fine particle pollution\", said Dr Emmanuel Ricard, a spokesperson for the French League Against Cancer.\n\nDiesel exhaust is one of the main sources of these particles, he said. The finest of these particles can descend into the lungs, all the way down to the alveoli. These are the tiny air sacs located at the end of the respiratory tree-like structure of the lung, where the blood exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide during the process of breathing in and breathing out.\n\nThe body's defence cells will \"want\" to remove these particles, and inflammation follows. This ends up disrupting the cells which, instead of continuing to replicate in a healthy way, will begin to \"dysfunction\", becoming cancerous. \"These cancer cells will multiply, and form a tumour,\" Ricard said.\n\nMore people, and older\n\nAt least several factors indicated by the study are unrelated to pollution. The rapidly growing global cancer rate reflects population growth: as the number of human beings on the planet continues to increase, the total number of cancer cases will also increase.\n\nAnd while humans are becoming more numerous, the species is also living longer. \"Cancer is a problem of immunity, and immunity declines the older we get. As a result, the longer the population's life expectancy, the more it will be at risk of getting cancer,\" said Ricard.\n\nAnother classic illusion in the epidemiological data is linked to the improvement of cancer diagnosis itself. These are cases that already existed in the past, but which escaped medical radars. Now, as they are being detected, they contribute to an increase in overall cancer cases.\n\nThere are also situations of \"overdiagnosis\", in which the presence of cancer cells is confused with cancer as such, said Catherine Hill, a French epidemiologist.\n\nA classic case is prostate cancer. According to the French Institute for Public Health Surveillance (InVs), 30% of 30-year-old men and 80% of 80-year-old men have cancer cells in their prostate. \"This is extremely common. It's obvious that not all of these cancer cells give rise to symptomatic cancers,\" said Hill.\n\nMental health\n\nMore and more studies are establishing - although it has yet to be confirmed - a link between pollution and the deterioration of health, including mental health. Pollution even supposedly aggravates depression.\n\nThese are \"trends\" full of scientific estimations, said Hill. After tobacco, alcohol consumption is the leading cause of cancer in France according to WHO, said Hill. \"Pollution causes 50 times less cancer in France than tobacco, and 20 times less than alcohol,\" she added, quoting a study by WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer.\n\nYet it would be wrong to consider the factors of cancer as isolated, said Ricard. An individual exposed to several factors will have a higher risk of getting cancer. The knowledge that exists on the effect that tobacco and alcohol together can have on cancer rates can be applied elsewhere, he said. \"We were thus able to find, in the case of lung cancer, genes that were just as impacted by cigarettes as by atmospheric pollution,\" said Ricard.\n\nThe dangers of the world's 'dumping ground'\n\nYet the pollution factor is not the same for everyone, since humans do not breathe the same air. \"In the big cities of China, India, South America, Antananarivo [in Madagascar], and even Cairo, clouds of particles form out of the pollution.\n\nUnder this 'smog', people develop lung cancer, just like in England during the industrial revolution,\" said Ricard.\n\nThere is now a transfer of pollution towards the \"South\", which is used as a \"dumping ground for the world\", Ricard added. \"Besides the 'at-risk' factories that industrialized countries prefer to relocate, developing economies are sold low-cost oil derivatives of inferior quality.\"\n\nThose who have visited the megacities of developing countries will agree: the pollution seems stronger there. This is indeed because it is more aggressive: \"The diesel fuels used there are even richer in sulphur and nitrogen than those emitted in Europe,\" said Ricard.\n\nFor Richard, WHO's report highlights an epidemiological transition. The countries previously impacted by infectious diseases, which are declining, will soon face a surge of diseases, like cancer, common to Western countries.\n\nAn ecological wake-up call?\n\nIn France, for instance, air quality has improved over the past 30 years. In the Toulouse metropolitan area, the presence of fine particles and nitrogen oxide fell respectively by 40% and 17% between 2009 and 2019.\n\nThis has had a positive impact on cardiovascular diseases, strokes, heart attacks and cancers, said Ricard.\n\nLess encouraging is the study carried out in the Toulouse region, which concludes that the economically disadvantaged population is more exposed to air pollution, and more concerned by deaths attributable to long-term exposure.\n\nBeyond these socio-economic disparities, Xavier Briffault, a researcher working in social sciences and epistemology of mental health at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) saw potential for an ecological wake-up call.\n\nBy demonstrating a direct correlation between health and environmental degradation, science could take us from environmental protection, driven by ethics, to ecological awareness, driven by public health concerns.\n\nHealth is not an end in itself but also a means in our fight for a greener world, said Briffault. By mobilizing our fears, the health issue also allows citizens to put pressure on politicians with the message: \"Not only are you killing the planet, but you are killing us.\"\n\nThe rallying cry that \"polluting is bad\" is bound to disappear, to be replaced by a new logic: Pollution is killing us.",

I would like to give them some credit, they started hosting their destination weddings in foreign countries because India does not allow Rahat Fateh Ali Khan, Shafqat Amanat Ali, Atif Aslam to come in and perform. (They said) We will host our weddings outside so they can come and perform.\"\n\nRahat's music, once widely embraced in India, faced a setback after the ban, with his songs in Salman Khan's Dabangg 3 being replaced. Despite this, his music continues to resonate with fans across the border.\n\nIn a significant ruling in October, 2023, the Bombay High Court rejected a petition that sought to ban artists from Pakistan in India. The petition, filed by cine worker and artiste, Faaiz Anwar Qureshi, had urged the government of India to prohibit Pakistani artists, including actors, musicians, singers, lyricists, and technicians, from collaborating with or working in India.\n\nAs per a report by Bollywood Hungama and Live Law India, the division bench of Justice Sunil B Shukre and Justice Firdosh P Pooniwalla ruled against this plea, emphasising the importance of promoting peace and cultural harmony through artistic exchanges.\n\nRahat's remarks come after Pakistani singer Atif Aslam, known for chart-toppers like Dil Diyan Gallan and Tera Hone Laga Hoon among other cross-border hits, is reportedly preparing for his Bollywood comeback. According to India Today, Atif is set to lend his voice to a song in the upcoming Bollywood film Love Story of 90s.\n\nThe film producers expressed their excitement, saying, \"It is a very reassuring thing for Atif Aslam to make a comeback after 7-8 years. We are very happy because he has sung the first song in our film Love Story of 90s. Atif Aslam's fans will be very thrilled. He is going to make a comeback in Bollywood through our film.\"",

        "title": "Pakistan's inter-provincial water conflicts",
        "text": "The writer is former Dean Faculty of Social Science, University of Karachi and can be reached at amoons@hotmail.com\n\nIn terms of water conflicts, Pakistan is a unique country because apart from having water issues with India and Afghanistan, it has water conflicts involving its own provinces. According to reports, caretaker Chief Minister of Sindh Justice (retd) Maqbool Baqar has recently written a letter to caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul Haq Kakar expressing serious concerns over a \"covert plan\" of the Indus River System Authority (IRSA) for extension of irrigated agriculture in the Cholistan desert of Punjab.\n\nIt is not just the prevailing water conflict between Punjab and Sindh over provision of extra water to irrigate parts of the Cholistan desert, the two provinces have a history of leveling allegations against each other. Sindh is blaming Punjab for depriving its share of water under 1991 IRSA accord whereas Punjab terms it a baseless allegation. For years the issue of Kalabagh Dam remained a bone of contention between Sindh and Punjab. As a lower riparian province, grievances of Sindh are reflected in statements of Sindhi nationalists who blame Punjab for not releasing adequate amount of water to preserve flora and fauna as well as marine resources in its Indus delta region south of Kotri.\n\nIn his letter to the caretaker PM, the caretaker Chief Minister of Sindh regretted, \"The Punjab government had presented a proposal for issuance of 'Water Availability Certificate' for extension of irrigated agriculture of Cholistan. The proposal involves construction of feeder channel with designed capacity of 4,122 cfs (cubic feet per second), offtaking from Suleimanki Headwords to feed areas of districts of Bhawalnagar and Bahawalpur.\" Concern was expressed that the 'Water Availability Certificate' proposal was made without seeking consent from Sindh. At least, IRSA should have deferred the issuance of certificate till the completion of general election and the assumption of new governments at the Centre and in provinces. When the issue of water share among provinces was settled under the 1991 IRSA accord, Sindh argues as to why \"the maximum utilization of the Punjab during Kharif season was 37.7 MAF in 2007 against allocation of 37.67 MAF which means that the existing canal capacity of the Punjab province was more than its Water Accord allocations.\"\n\nPakistan is facing a worst form of water crisis because of environmental factors like global warming and melting of glaciers. At a time when water at the upstream level, which is dependent on the melting of glaciers, is facing growing mitigation, how can water reach the lower stream like in Sindh province, particularly the Indus delta? The summer of 2024 is expected to be harsh in Pakistan because of less than average quantum of snow accumulated on glaciers and in the northern parts of Pakistan. Facing acute water shortage, the federal government, particularly IRSA, should have taken preventive measures to save water for irrigation. Instead, IRSA has triggered a new conflict in the form of 'Water Availability Certificate' benefiting Punjab's desert region of Cholistan. Had the issue been taken up with the Sindh government before the grant of additional water to Punjab, we wouldn't have seen Sindh pitched against IRSA and Punjab.\n\nAt a time when Pakistan is bogged down in water conflicts with India and Afghanistan, opening another front, within the country, on water distribution is unfortunate. Why was IRSA desperate to issue 'Water Availability Certificate' to Punjab before elections as it could have, as suggested by the Sindh's caretaker CM, waited for new elected governments to take charge. It means that there is lack of professionalism and fairness on the part of those who are supposed to manage distribution of water among provinces. The seriousness of intra-state (inter-provincial) water crisis needs to be analysed from three angles.\n\nFirst, the absence of a water management mechanism in Pakistan tends to further augment the prevailing water crisis in the country. IRSA, which should have been responsible for ensuring water management, is itself a source of conflict particularly between Sindh and Punjab. Balochistan, which gets a meager share of water from the Indus source, also suffers because of the unfair distribution of water. When Sindh has grievances that Punjab not only steals its share of water, but its control over national resources further undermines its legitimate interests related to the adequate supply of water from the Indus source, it means the federal government is not properly performing its duties. Otherwise, the caretaker Sindh CM wouldn't complained to the caretaker PM in writing about IRSA's unfair issuance of 'Water Availability Certificate' to Punjab.\n\nSecond, it is high time that instead of further ignoring polarisation and conflict over water at the provincial level, a water management mechanism at federal and provincial levels should to be adopted at the earliest. Amid the looming drought threat, if adequate availability of water is not ensured for irrigation, a policy to efficiently use water and prevent its wastage and stealing should be adopted. It is estimated that 30% of water supplied for irrigation is either wasted, evaporates or is stolen by water 'mafias'. Instead of indulging in blame game and pursuing an irresponsible approach, Sindh and Punjab need to resolve the conflict through dialogue, with the federal government playing a proactive role. Before the arrival of summer, which will augment water and energy crisis in Pakistan, the need is to seriously adopt a water management mechanism for a permanent solution to the grave water predicament.\n\nFinally, there is a need to evolve consensus over the construction of Kalabagh Dam which has been pending for six decades. Undue and unreasonable criticism against the Kalabagh Dam, particularly by Sindh and KP, further aggravates the issue of water scarcity in Pakistan. From any standpoint, Kalabagh Dam is still the most feasible water project in Pakistan which can ensure irrigation water amounting to millions of acre feet as well as 6,000 megawatts of electricity. Unfortunately, the project was politicised. It became a victim of factually wrong assertions that its construction would inundate Nowshera in KP and deprive Sindh of water. Since 1974 when Tarbela Dam had been made operational, no mega dam has been constructed in Pakistan and it is yet to be seen how feasible Diamar-Bhasha Dam will be, given its mountainous terrain in Gilgit-Baltistan.",

The civil and military leadership said the brewing humanitarian and security crises in the IIOJ&K seriously threatens regional peace and stability.\n\nPrime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar, AJK prime minister and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir visited Muzaffarabad on eve of Kashmir Solidarity Day on Monday.\n\nThe COAS later visited troops deployed on the front lines along Line of Control (LOC) in Sarian Sector. \"Pakistan Army is well versed with the full threat spectrum and is perpetually ready to respond effectively,\" the COAS said. Addressing troops, the COAS also mentioned the Indian state sponsored terrorism in Pakistan which now extended to heinous targeting of individual Pakistani citizens on our soil. \"Such callous disregard for international law and norms of international system was becoming a routine occurrence and India was now being called out openly by many countries in the world, exposing her sham credentials, \" COAS concluded, adding that Pakistan would continue to expose all such attempts and ensure the security of its citizens.\n\nUpon arrival at Jammu and Kashmir Monument Muzaffarabad, PM Kakar, AJK PM and COAS laid floral wreath at Martyrs' Monument and paid rich tribute to the supreme sacrifices of Shuhada.\n\nGeneral Asim Munir was briefed about the latest situation along the LOC and appreciated the operational readiness, high morale and effective response of troops to Indian CFVs.\n\nEarlier on arrival, COAS was received by Commander Rawalpindi Corps.\n\nMeanwhile, Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar on Monday said that India was a terrorist state, which had been committing the worst atrocities and brutalities against the innocent people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IIOJ&K) for decades.\n\nThe world was, however, silently watching the Indian state terrorism against the Kashmiris, he regretted while addressing the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Legislative Assembly on the occasion of Kashmir Solidarity Day.\n\nThe prime minister said for last many years, India was presenting a false narrative and trying to weaken the indigenous movement of the Kashmiris for freedom by wrongly labeling them as terrorists. There was a clear difference between terrorism and the people's struggle for independence, he added.\n\nPM Kakar said that the Indian leadership was also claiming that Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu & Kashmir were part of their country. \"On this day, I make it clear that that India should not have any such illusions. We believe in peace and are showing maximum patience and tolerance, but any misadventure in this regard will be forcefully responded.\"\n\nHe reaffirmed that Pakistan did not want any conflict in the region, however, it was fully capable of strongly retaliating any attack on its soil. India, he said, had for many times tested Pakistan's capacity, and if still had any desire in that regard then \"we are fully ready to show our might\".\n\nHe said if India was a true democracy then it should give the people of Kashmir their just right to self-determination, besides restoring all the basic human rights in the IIOJ&K.\n\nPM Kakar said India must also stop the gross violations of human rights in the region along with releasing all the political prisoners. It should also abrogate all the strict emergency laws, besides removing its heavy military presence from the villages and towns of Kashmir. It should allow the Kashmiris to hold peaceful gatherings, he added.\n\nThe prime minister said that India must allow unrestricted access to the observers of UN and Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), international media and human rights organizations to IIOJ&K to get first-hand information about the situation there; and investigate and report human rights violations.\n\nHe said that India's illegal and unilateral actions of August 5, 2019 usurping the special status of the IIOJ&K were a blatant violation of international laws, including the UN Charter, 4th Geneva Convention and the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.\n\nThe prime minister said that Pakistan had consistently maintained that a lasting solution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was possible only in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and as per the wishes of Kashmiri people. Pakistan would continue its moral, diplomatic and political support for the just cause, he vowed.\n\nHowever, he added, India over the last 76 years had carried out a relentless campaign to intimidate and suppress the IIOJ&K people as evident from extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions and custodial torture.\n\nMeanwhile, the president, the prime minister and the foreign minister, in their special messages on the occasion, have renewed Pakistan's unstinting moral, diplomatic and political support to the Kashmir cause. The foreign minister has addressed letters to the presidents of the UN Security Council and General Assembly, the UN Secretary General, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the OIC Secretary General to update them on the latest developments in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K).\n\nIn these letters, the foreign minister has emphasized the need to implement the relevant Security Council resolutions so that the people of Jammu and Kashmir could determine their future through a fair and impartial plebiscite under the UN auspices. He has also urged the UN and OIC leadership to play their role in improving the human rights situation in IIOJ&K and for release of Kashmiri political prisoners and dissenters.\n\nIn the run up to the Kashmir Solidarity Day, a briefing was organized for Islamabad-based diplomats to apprise them of the situation in IIOJ&K.\n\nA 'Solidarity Day Walk' was held on the Constitution Avenue, earlier today, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs up to the Parliament Building.

Early on Monday, KP saw the latest in an ongoing streak of militant attacks ahead of the polls, as a group of around 30 heavily-armed mili\u00adtants overran a police station in the city of Dera Ismail Khan.\n\nUnlike the northeastern Punjab and southern Sindh provinces, where public rallies and gatherings are in full swing, Balochistan, the country's largest prov\u00adince in terms of land, is severely lacking the traditional election fervour.\n\nThe province, however, is the small\u00adest in terms of population, and has only 16 National Assembly seats out of the 266 total direct seats up for grabs.\n\nPolitical parties are avoiding hold\u00ading rallies and corner meetings on the heels of escalating violence that has al\u00adready claimed over three dozen lives across the province over the past week.\n\nSuspected militants have target\u00aded several election offices across Ba\u00adlochistan, killing a local politician and injuring over a dozen activists of dif\u00adferent political parties in the provincial capital Quetta and other districts in re\u00adcent days.\n\nA government advisory has warned candidates to avoid \"unnecessary move\u00adment\" in the coming days, saying that suicide bombers may target rallies and public gatherings across Balochistan.\n\n\"Political activities are very low in Balochistan this time compared to the 2018 elections. It's all because of the security threats. Even candidates are looking for alternate ways to reach out to voters,\" Zafar Baloch, a Quetta-based political commentator, told Anadolu.\n\nOnly a couple of parties, according to Baloch, dared to hold public rallies in Quetta, while a majority of candi\u00addates are concentrating on closed-door meetings and social media tools.\n\n\"Both candidates and voters are scared because of the escalating vio\u00adlence and security threats,\" he said.\n\n\"I think we will see a low turnout of voters this time.\"\n\nBalochistan, which touches neigh\u00adboring Iran and Afghanistan, is strate\u00adgically important due to its rich copper, zinc and natural gas reserves.\n\nThe province is also a key route of the $64 billion China-Pakistan Eco\u00adnomic Corridor (CPEC), which aims to connect China's strategically important northwestern Xinjiang province to Ba\u00adlochistan's Gwadar port through a net\u00adwork of roads, railways, and pipelines for cargo, oil, and gas transportation.\n\nThe region has long been facing a low-intensity rebellion from Baloch separatists, who claim the province was \"forcibly\" incorporated into Paki\u00adstan in 1947, following the end of Brit\u00adish colonial rule in United India.\n\nBORDER AREAS MORE VULNERABLE\n\nRehan Zeb Khan, a young candidate from KP's Bajaur tribal district, was gunned down by unknown assailants while campaigning last week.\n\nThree other people were also injured in the shooting.\n\nThe slain candidate was affiliat\u00aded with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party of jailed ex-Prime Minister Imran Khan.\n\nBajaur, which sits on the Pak-Afghan border, has long been beset with vio\u00adlence.\n\nOver 60 people were killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up in the middle of a rally organized by main\u00adstream religiopolitical party Jamiat Ul\u00adema-e-Islam (JUI) last year.\n\nZahoor Buledi, a candidate for the center-left Pakistan People's Party (PPP), escaped a hand grenade attack in Balochistan's coastal district of Tur\u00adbat, which has forced him to take all ex\u00adtra precautions.\n\n\"Security challenges are no doubt huge, particularly in Balochistan,\" Bul\u00adedi told Anadolu by telephone.\n\n\"I have been attacked, our workers are being attacked and threatened, but we will not give in,\" he added.\n\nBuledi has already asked his support\u00aders and party activists not to canvass in large groups, especially in the troubled areas.\n\nIn another incident, a local leader of the Awami National Party (ANP), a na\u00adtionalist political party, was gunned down in an attack on an election office in Balochistan's Chaman district, which also borders Afghanistan.\n\nAnother party worker was also in\u00adjured in the attack that took place last week.\n\nPEACEFUL ELECTIONS 'AT ANY COST'\n\nPakistan has seen an uptick in ter\u00adrorism incidents, mainly in border are\u00adas, since the Afghan Taliban recaptured Kabul in August 2021.\n\nIslamabad accuses \"Afghani\u00adstan-based\" militants of being involved in the recent attacks, a charge Kabul denies.\n\nJan Achakzai, the caretaker infor\u00admation minister in Balochistan's provincial government, said law en\u00adforcement agencies are taking \"all possible\" measures to thwart any at\u00adtempt to sabotage the elections, espe\u00adcially on polling day.\n\nAt a press conference in Quetta, Achakzai said internet service at \"sen\u00adsitive\" polling stations in several dis\u00adtricts of the province will be temporar\u00adily suspended.\n\nHe asserted that \"peaceful elections are the government's prime responsi\u00adbility and target, which will be done at any cost.\"\n\n\"The recent attacks have compelled candidates and politicians to further beef up their security,\" Imtiaz Hussein, a Peshawar-based political analyst, told Anadolu.\n\nHe said candidates are avoiding big rallies or open-air gatherings, aside from restricting their movements throughout KP.\n\nIntelligence agencies have warned that candidates of parties like the JUI and ANP could be the main targets in terror attacks.",

On the other hand, when the perpetrators are ar\u00adrested and tried in the courts, they are acquit\u00adted by the courts of the country, said Dr Palu\u00adsha.\n\nDr Wahid Rasool, Secretary Human Rights Protection Pakistan said Amnesty Internation\u00adal had also demanded an investigation into vi\u00adolence against peaceful citizens and protest\u00aders by security agencies in India in 2019 and 2020. So far, no outcome of those demand has been shared with the media or public, he said. In 2022, the extrajudicial and custodial killings of innocent Kashmiri Muslims by the Indian Army, paramilitary forces, and police person\u00adnel remained at unprecedentedly high, he said.",

The move was aimed at snatching away identity, properties, government services of the Kashmiris through changing the Muslim-majority status of the occupied territory.\n\nThe report revealed that Indian troops martyred 857 Kashmiris including 17 women and 28 young boys during the period.\n\nThe report said that the troops damaged over 1116 houses and molested and disgraced 133 women during cordon and search operations and house raids across the occupied territory in the period.\n\nThousands of Hurriyat leaders, activists, Ulema, journalists, youth, woman and human rights defenders including APHC Chairman Masarrat Aalam Butt, Muhammad Yasin Malik, Shabbir Ahmad Shah, Aasiya Andrabi, Naheeda Nasreen, Fehmeeda Sufi, Nayeem Ahmad Khan, Ayaz Akbar, Pir Saifullah, Merajuddin Kalwal, Shahid-ul-Islam, Farooq Ahmed Dar, Syed Shahid Shah, Syed Shakeel Ahmad, Dr Hameed Fayaz, Bilal Sidiqi, Molvi Bashir Irfani, Mushtaq-ul-Islam, Ameer Hamza, , Abdul Ahmad Parra, Noor Muhammad Fayaz, Fahim Ramzan, Hayat Ahmed Butt, Advocate Zahid Ali, Zaffar Akbar Butt , Muhammad Yousuf Falahi, Dr Muhammad Qasim Fakhtoo, Dr Muhammad Shafi Shariati, Ghulam Qadir Butt, , Umar Adil Dar, Shabir Ahmed Dar, Firdous Ahmed Shah, Jahangir Ghani Butt, Saleem Nanaji, Sajad Hussain Gul, Muhammad Yasin Butt, Shamsuddin Rehmani, Hassan Firdousi, Sarjan Barkati, human rights defender Khurrum Parvaiz, journalists Aasif Sultan, and Eng Rasheed are the worst victims of political vendetta,\" it said.

        "text": "Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar on Monday said that India was a terrorist state, which had been committing the worst atrocities and brutalities against the innocent people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir for decades.\n\nThe world was, however, silently watching the Indian state terrorism against the Kashmiris, he regretted while addressing the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly on the occasion of Kashmir Solidarity Day.\n\nThe prime minister said for last many years, India was presenting a false narrative and trying to weaken the indigenous movement of the Kashmiris for freedom by wrongly labeling them as terrorists. There was a clear difference between terrorism and the people's struggle for independence, he added.\n\nPM Kakar said that the Indian leadership was also claiming that Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu & Kashmir were part of their country.\n\n\"On this day, I make it clear that that India should not have any such illusions. We believe in peace and are showing maximum patience and tolerance, but any misadventure in this regard will be forcefully responded.\"\n\nHe reaffirmed that Pakistan did not want any conflict in the region, however, it was fully capable of strongly retaliating any attack on its soil.\n\nIndia, he said, had for many times tested Pakistan's capacity, and if still had any desire in that regard then \"we are fully ready to show our might\".\n\nHe said if India was a true democracy then it should give the people of Kashmir their just right to self-determination, besides restoring all the basic human rights in the IIOJK.\n\nPM Kakar said India must also stop the gross violations of human rights in the region along with releasing all the political prisoners. It should also abrogate all the strict emergency laws, besides removing its heavy military presence from the villages and towns of Kashmir.\n\nIt should allow the Kashmiris to hold peaceful gatherings, he added.\n\nThe prime minister said that India must allow unrestricted access to the observers of UN and Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC), international media and human rights organizations to IIOJK to get first-hand information about the situation there; and investigate and report human rights violations.\n\nHe said that India's illegal and unilateral actions of August 5, 2019 usurping the special status of of the IIOJK were a blatant violation of international laws, including the UN Charter, 4th Geneva Convention and the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.\n\nIndia had since been engaged in taking further measures to alter the demographic structure and political landscape of the held Valley, he added. PM Kakar said that the 'Kashmir Solidarity Day' was annually observed on the 5th February across Pakistan to express its unwavering support for the Kashmiris' just struggle for realization of their right to self-determination.\n\nIt was also an occasion to pay rich tribute to the sacrifices rendered by the Kashmiri brothers and sisters during the last 76 years, he added.\n\nThe prime minister said that Pakistan had consistently maintained that a lasting solution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was possible only in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and as per the wishes of Kashmiri people. Pakistan would continue its moral, diplomatic and political support for the just cause, he vowed.\n\nPM Kakar said that the relevant UN Security Council resolutions provided that the final disposition of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute would be made in accordance with the will of its people through the democratic method of a free and impartial plebiscite conducted under the auspices of the United Nations. However, he added, India over the last 76 years had carried out a relentless campaign to intimidate and suppress the IIOJK people as evident from extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions and custodial torture. Earlier on his arrival at arrival at the AJK Legislative Assembly, the prime minister was presented a guard of honour.",

        "text": "ISLAMABAD (APP): Caretaker Federal Minister for Information, Broadcasting and Parliamentary Affairs Murtaza Solangi on Monday said that the government had not issued any guideline to shut down internet and mobile signals on the day of general election.\n\nSpeaking in a private news channel programme, the minister said that the local administrations had the authority to decide about shutting down internet in a specific area if it faced any law and order issue. He said there was no doubt that an extraordinary situation required extraordinary measures, however, so far no such a situation had been reported in any area.\n\nHighlighting the government's measures to curb fake news and propaganda on social media, the minister said the relevant institutions had been issuing clarification to rebut any such news circulating in different media. \"Security is a serious issue,\" he said, while pointing out a steep rise in activities of different terrorist groups in the country, especially after the establishment an interim government in Kabul.\n\n\"Last year alone, around 1,500 incidents of terrorism were reported in the country,\" Murtaza Solangi noted. Police cops were martyred in a terrorist attack on a police station in the Dera Ismail Khan, he said, adding such acts had failed to affect the resolve of law enforcement agencies fighting terrorism in the country.\n\nHe noted that recently, 24 terrorists were killed in Mach area of Balochistan. The minister ruled out any delay in the elections which were scheduled for February 8. The history of Pakistan suggested that the elections were held in harsh and difficult conditions. To a query, he said the Kashmir dispute was a long-standing issue on the agenda of the United Nations Security Council.\n\nHe recalled that some 75 years ago, the then Indian prime minister promised in the United Nations Security Council that the Kashmiri people would be given their right to self-determination so that they could decide their own destiny. \"On August 5, 2019, India changed the status of Kashmir by taking unilateral and illegal actions,\" he said while regretting that the Indian government deprived the Kashmiris of their rights by abolishing Article 370 of the Indian Constitution. He said the government and the people of Pakistan would continue to extend their moral, legal and diplomatic support to the people of Kashmir.\n\nTo another query, the minister clarified that the caretaker government had no favourites in the elections and the statement of the Pakistan Peoples Party chairman in that regard was \"unfortunate\". The minister reiterated that the caretaker government was ensuring a level-playing field for all the political parties and the state media was giving due coverage to all of them. Solangi said all-out efforts were being made to ensure equal treatment to all the political parties, but ironically \"complaining is part of Pakistan's political culture\".\n\nThe PML-N had complaints of an uneven playing field in Sindh, while the PPP in Punjab and Maulana Fazlur Rehman in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said, adding that the matter of level-playing field was being politicized for political gains. He believed that the people of Pakistan would come out on the election day in a large number to elect the parties of their choice. To another query, he said there had been a significant increase in the number of registered voters for the general elections 2024. The number of women voters alone was increased by 2 million, he added.\n\nThe proportion of the submission and acceptance of nomination papers for the elections 2024 was higher than the previous ones, he noted. A helpline, he said, had been established for quick redressal of the complaints of local and foreign journalists and observers. The minister urged the citizens to express their love for the country by exercising their right to vote on the election day. \"It is clearly written in the preamble of the Constitution that the country will be run by its elected representatives,\" he said while regretting a persistent propaganda about the election delay.\n\nThe caretaker government from the very beginning held a stance that the elections would be conducted on time, he added. The minister said the caretaker government would stand dissolved following the election of the Leader of House in the National Assembly and oath-taking of the newly elected prime minister. To another query, Solangi said the caretaker government would pass on a \"handover note\" to the next elected government about its achievements and failures.",

The rally condemned organized state terrorism and human rights abuses at IIOJK and urged International Community including UN Security Council to implement its resolutions on Kashmir.\n\nMisal Khan, a retired information officer said that fascist Modi regime has broken all records of atrocities and organized state terrorism at IIOJK where Indian occupation forces were using human rights abuses against women and children as a weapon of war in a bid to suppress the indigenous freedom movement there but failed. He said unlimited restrictions on free media imposed by the RSS backed Modi regime in IIOJK was meant to hide its forces Israel like war crimes at IIOJK.\n\nHe said nearly one million Indian occupied forces have unleashed terror and killed hundreds of thousands of Kashmirs in fake encounters and extra judicially as evident of young freedom fighter Burhan Wani and jailed hurriet leader Yasin Malik in a fake case. Farooq Rehman, Chairman Jummu and Kashmir Peoples' Freedom League said the people of Kashmir wanted to join Pakistan as per Indo-Pakistan partition plan and started freedom struggle against Maharaja Hari Singh and illegal occupation of India after the latter illegaly entered in troops at Srinagar on October 27, 1947.\n\n\"The Maharaja's authority over Jummu and Kashmir state was officially ended on August 15, 1947 and people of Kashmir was left with no choice but to stood up against Mahraja Hari Singh's illegal move and India's forced occupation.\" He said that on January 1, 1948, it was India that brought the Kashmir issue before the UN, where it was agreed by a number of resolutions that the destiny of Jummu and Kashmir would be decided by plebiscite under UN supervision.\n\nLater India had betracked from all UN resolutions and declined to hold the plebiscite in Kashmir that was share violation of UN charter. On August 5, 2019, he said India abrogated special status of IIOJK attempting to rob Kashmiris of their history, language and identity.\n\nThe August 5 illegal acts were done with mala-fide intentions, meticulous planning and nefarious designs, he said, adding All the Hurriyat leadership was incarcerated and even politicians like Farooq Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, who in the past were considered pro Indian government, were arrested.\n\nThousands of young Kashmiris ranging from 15 to 35 years were picked from their homes and locked in different prisons of India and most of them continue to languish there in inhuman conditions. ' \"The goal was to create a fear-psychosis within the population of held Kashmir, and to convey the message that any person showing semblance of resistance will be dealt with brutal force.\"\n\nHe said great Kashmiri leader Syed Ali Geelani were buried at night after Indian forces snatched his body from his family and Kashmiris were not allowed to attend funeral of their beloved leader. Farooq Rehman said that anybody writing against the occupation forces based on facts is slapped with draconian Unlawful Public Activity Act (ULPA) and subsequently imprisoned without any judicial reprieve.\n\nHe said cordon and search operations are held on a daily basis in all areas of occupied land to create an atmosphere of fear and to arrest or kill youth.\n\nDuring this process, he said properties are destroyed besides human rights abuses against women and youngsters at IIOJK exposed Indian's forces war crimes against humanity. He claimed that all the top-level government positions are held by Hindus from India at IIOJK where local Kashmiri officials are being marginalized. With the influx of a large population of Hindus from India, local Kashmiris find it difficult to compete even for the lower positions in the government.\n\nRehmani said institutions that were previously under the jurisdiction of IOK (Indian occupied Kashmir) Government are now run by New Delhi and there is assiduous effort to increase the number of Hindu applicants into Medical and Engineering colleges.\n\nHe said banks in held Jammu Kashmir that used to provide an avenue of employment and funds for the local population has been heavily Indianized and filled with Hindus from India while any financial transaction taking place in administrative sector has to go through Reserve Bank of India besides destruction of agriculture land through construction of unnecessary roads.\n\nThe apple production being the main source of income for occupied Kashmiris, is systematically being decimated by many oppressive measures like delaying the harvest and impeding the transportation so that fruit gets destroyed in the process and Kashmiris suffered economic losses while revenue records are being tampered to change the ownership of commercial properties from Muslims to Hindus of India in the held valley.\n\nMeanwhile, Kashmir solidarity rallies were held at Swat, Swabi, Khyber, Waziristan, Nowshera, Malakand, Dir, Abbottabad, Manshera, DI Khan, Kohat and merged tribal districts.

        "text": "LONDON (BBC): Millions of barrels of fuel made from Russian oil are still being imported to the UK despite sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine, research claims.\n\nA so-called \"loophole\" means Russian crude is refined in countries such as India and the products sold to the UK.\n\nThis is not illegal and does not breach the UK's Russian oil ban, but critics say it undermines sanctions aimed at restricting Russia's war funds.\n\nThe UK government denied there had been any imports of Russian oil since 2022. But a spokesman said internationally recognised \"rules of origin\" define that crude, once refined in another country, is classed for the purposes of trade as originating from the refining country. The UK is among many Western countries to ban the import of all oil and oil products that originate in Russia in a bid to hit the amount of cash Moscow can generate from fossil fuels.\n\nBut two separate reports, shared exclusively with the BBC, suggest the rules on refining enable products made from Russian crude oil to arrive on UK soil.\n\nThe Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) said this \"refining loophole\" meant countries such as India and China, who have not sanctioned the Kremlin, are able to legally import Russian crude and refine it into oil products such as jet fuel and diesel. They then export those products to the likes of the UK and the EU.\n\n\"The issue with this loophole is that it increases the demand for Russian crude and enables higher sales in terms of volume and pushing up their price as well, which increases the funds sent to the Kremlin's war chest,\" said Isaac Levi, head of CREA's Europe-Russia policy and energy analysis. In a separate research paper, campaign group Global Witness estimated that throughout 2023, some 5.2 million barrels of refined petroleum products that had been produced from Russian crude oil were imported to the UK.\n\nMost of the fuel imported - 4.6 million barrels - was jet fuel, which the group's researchers suggested was used in one in 20 UK flights.\n\nLela Stanley, campaign lead for the Ukraine team at Global Witness, said while \"the UK government falls over itself to decry the war in Ukraine, it remains complicit in the sale of Russian oil by keeping this refining loophole open\".\n\n\"Every single pound spent on Russian oil helps Putin pay for his brutal war,\" she added.\n\nThe exclusive figures shared with the BBC from CREA estimated that during the first 12 months of the Russian oil ban from December 2022, some \u00a3569m worth of oil products imported by the UK were derived from Russian crude.\n\nBoth reports claimed the so-called loophole indirectly provided the Kremlin with more than \u00a3100m in tax revenues.\n\nThey also said the bulk of the imports came mainly from three oil refineries in India - Jamnagar, Vadinar and New Mangalore, along with nine others in several countries including China.\n\nMost of the estimates made by CREA and Global Witness were based on analysis of oil shipment figures from data and analytics firm Kpler, with pricing data based on Eurostat along with some other data sources.\n\nBoth CREA and Global Witness said the two research papers were based on assumptions and admitted there were challenges and limitations around analysing such trade.",

        "text": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 05 (APP): Caretaker Federal Minister for Information, Broadcasting and Parliamentary Affairs Murtaza Solangi on Monday said that the government had not issued any guideline to shut down internet and mobile signals on the day of general election.\n\nSpeaking in a private news channel programme, the minister said that the local administrations had the authority to decide about shutting down internet in a specific area if it faced any law and order issue.\n\nHe said there was no doubt that an extraordinary situation required extraordinary measures, however, so far no such a situation had been reported in any area.\n\nHighlighting the government's measures to curb fake news and propaganda on social media, the minister said the relevant institutions had been issuing clarification to rebut any such news circulating in different media.\n\n\"Security is a serious issue,\" he said, while pointing out a steep rise in activities of different terrorist groups in the country, especially after the establishment an interim government in Kabul.\n\n\"Last year alone, around 1,500 incidents of terrorism were reported in the country,\" Murtaza Solangi noted.\n\nPolice cops were martyred in a terrorist attack on a police station in the Dera Ismail Khan, he said, adding such acts had failed to affect the resolve of law enforcement agencies fighting terrorism in the country.\n\nHe noted that recently, 24 terrorists were killed in Mach area of Balochistan.\n\nThe minister ruled out any delay in the elections which were scheduled for February 8. The history of Pakistan suggested that the elections were held in harsh and difficult conditions.\n\nTo a query, he said the Kashmir dispute was a long-standing issue on the agenda of the United Nations Security Council.\n\nHe recalled that some 75 years ago, the then Indian prime minister promised in the United Nations Security Council that the Kashmiri people would be given their right to self-determination so that they could decide their own destiny.\n\n\"On August 5, 2019, India changed the status of Kashmir by taking unilateral and illegal actions,\" he said while regretting that the Indian government deprived the Kashmiris of their rights by abolishing Article 370 of the Indian Constitution.\n\nHe said the government and the people of Pakistan would continue to extend their moral, legal and diplomatic support to the people of Kashmir.\n\nTo another query, the minister clarified that the caretaker government had no favourites in the elections and the statement of the Pakistan Peoples Party chairman in that regard was \"unfortunate\".\n\nThe minister reiterated that the caretaker government was ensuring a level-playing field for all the political parties and the state media was giving due coverage to all of them.\n\nSolangi said all-out efforts were being made to ensure equal treatment to all the political parties, but ironically \"complaining is part of Pakistan's political culture\".\n\nThe Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had complaints of an uneven playing field in Sindh, while the PPP in Punjab and Maulana Fazlur Rehman in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said, adding that the matter of level-playing field was being politicized for political gains.\n\nHe believed that the people of Pakistan would come out on the election day in a large number to elect the parties of their choice.\n\nTo another query, he said there had been a significant increase in the number of registered voters for the general elections 2024. The number of women voters alone was increased by 2 million, he added.\n\nThe proportion of the submission and acceptance of nomination papers for the elections 2024 was higher than the previous ones, he noted.\n\nA helpline, he said, had been established for quick redressal of the complaints of local and foreign journalists and observers.\n\nThe minister urged the citizens to express their love for the country by exercising their right to vote on the election day.\n\n\"It is clearly written in the preamble of the Constitution that the country will be run by its elected representatives,\" he said while regretting a persistent propaganda about the election delay.\n\nThe caretaker government from the very beginning held a stance that the elections would be conducted on time, he added.\n\nThe minister said the caretaker government would stand dissolved following the election of the Leader of House in the National Assembly and oath-taking of the newly elected prime minister.\n\nTo another query, Solangi said the caretaker government would pass on a \"handover note\" to the next elected government about its achievements and failures.",

On August 5, 2019, he said India abrogated the special status of IIOJK attempting to rob Kashmiris of their history, language and identity.\n\nThe August 5 illegal acts were done with mala-fide intentions, meticulous planning and nefarious designs, he said, adding All the Hurriyat leadership was incarcerated and even politicians like Farooq Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, who in the past were considered pro-Indian government, were arrested.\n\nThousands of young Kashmiris ranging from 15 to 35 years were picked from their homes and locked in different prisons of India and most of them continue to languish there in inhuman conditions.\n\n\"The goal was to create a fear-psychosis within the population of held Kashmir, and to convey the message that any person showing semblance of resistance will be dealt with brutal force.\"\n\nHe said great Kashmiri leader Syed Ali Geelani was buried at night after Indian forces snatched his body from his family and Kashmiris were not allowed to attend the funeral of their beloved leader.\n\nFarooq Rehman said that anybody writing against the occupation forces based on facts is slapped with the draconian Unlawful Public Activity Act (ULPA) and subsequently imprisoned without any judicial reprieve.\n\nHe said cordon and search operations are held daily in all areas of occupied land to create an atmosphere of fear and to arrest or kill youth. During this process, he said properties were destroyed besides human rights abuses against women and youngsters at IIOJK exposed Indian forces war crimes against humanity.\n\nHe claimed that all the top-level government positions are held by Hindus from India at IIOJK where local Kashmiri officials are being marginalized. With the influx of a large population of Hindus from India, local Kashmiris find it difficult to compete even for the lower positions in the government.\n\nRehmani said institutions that were previously under the jurisdiction of the IOK (Indian occupied Kashmir) Government are now run by New Delhi and there is an assiduous effort to increase the number of Hindu applicants into Medical and Engineering colleges.\n\nHe said banks in Indian Occupied Jammu & Kashmir that used to provide an avenue of employment and funds for the local population have been heavily Indianized and filled with Hindus from India while any financial transaction taking place in the administrative sector has to go through the Reserve Bank of India besides destruction of agriculture land through construction of unnecessary roads.\n\nThe fruit apple production being the main source of income for occupied Kashmiris is systematically being decimated by many oppressive measures like delaying the harvest and impeding transportation so that fruit gets destroyed in the process and Kashmiris suffer economic losses while revenue records are being tampered with to change the ownership of commercial properties from Muslims to Hindus of India in the valley.\n\nMeanwhile, Kashmir solidarity rallies were held at Swat, Swabi, Khyber, Waziristan, Nowshera, Malakand, Dir, Abbottabad, Manshera, DI Khan, Kohat and merged tribal districts.\n\nThe speakers highlighted the Kashmir issue and vowed to continue moral and political support to oppressed Kashmiris till achieving freedom from the Indian yoke.",

seen locking doors of houses due to human rights abuses and systematic state terrorism of Indian occupational forces since they invaded the held valley on October 27, 1947.\n\nBreaking all records of oppression and rights violation of the modern era, the Indian occupational forces unleashed terror in IIOJK after the fascist Modi government revoked its special status on August 5, 2019, forcing most Kashmiris to spend sleepless nights due to indiscriminate firing, cluster ammunition, sniper attacks, excessive use of pellet guns, fake encounters where women and children were being abducted and sexually assaulted as a weapon of war.\n\nSecretary General, World Kashmir Awareness Forum (WKAF), Dr Ghulam Nabi Fai stated that frustration at India's intransigence and the world's hesitation to fulfil its commitment drove the people of Kashmir to be more assertive in their struggle.\n\n\"In the past 34 years of struggle, since 1990 alone, Kashmiris' have suffered the loss of more than 100,000 civilians - men, women and children, and have borne the perpetration of countless atrocities by more than 900,000 Indian military and paramilitary forces concentrated in Kashmir as an army of occupation,\" Dr Fai said.\n\nHe regretted that the popular revolt in Eastern Europe countries was observed and reported by international media, but the Kashmir issue has remained largely hidden from the world's view.\n\n\"This is the reason that New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has cited that news media in Kashmir is at the brink of extinction,\" Dr Fai said.\n\nMeanwhile, Senior APHC leader and Chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Democratic Freedom Party (DFP) Shabbir Ahmed Shah has sought intervention of the world community to prevent the robbing of the people of occupied Jammu and Kashmir of their land, identity and integrity by the Modi-led Indian regime.\n\nAmnesty International, in its letter co-signed by six organizations, had recently urged the representatives of G20 member countries on the eve of its summit in New Delhi in September, for the release of jailed human rights defenders and political prisoners.\n\nThese organizations included the Asian Federation Against Involuntary Disappearances, the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development, CIVICUS: World Alliance for Citizen Participation, Front Line Defenders and the Kashmir Law and Justice Project.\n\nThe organizations had urged the G-20 countries, \"to raise these issues directly and forthrightly with the government of India in accordance with their obligations under international law and call on India to adhere to its international legal obligations.\"\n\n\"The voices in this letter resonate with a global call for justice, accountability, and the protection of human dignity in one of the world's most contested territories,\" the letter stated.\n\nOrganization of Islamic countries (OIC) has also repeatedly supported Kashmiri people's struggle and called upon India to give Kashmiris their just right to self-determination.\n\nAccording to Kashmir Media Service, Shah stated, \"Coercion, intimidation and harassment of political activists, journalists, rights groups and civil society activists, has been a hallmark of the Modi government's Kashmir policy.\"\n\nMushtaq Ahmed Shah, Voice Chairman, Jammu and Kashmir's Peoples League told APP that most of oppressed Kashmiris in IIOJK were either being attacked or kidnapped after Indian forces resorted to serious human rights abuses mostly against women and children as a weapon of war after Hinduvata BJP regime had abolished the special status of IIOJK.\n\nAccompanied by sniffer dogs, Indian-occupied forces forcefully entered the houses of Kashmiris even at midnight in the name of a so-called search operation and misbehaved with women and children that made Kashmiris almost sleepless.\n\n\"The 43-paged report of the Office of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) 2019 had exposed Indian security forces' systematic terrorism and war crimes at IIOJK,\" said Mushtaq Ahmad Shah.\n\nThe report testified that Indian occupied forces had used excessive force and pellet guns against peaceful Kashmiris in 2016, resulting in deaths and injuries of a large number of civilians which was a clear violation of UN Basic Principles on Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, he said.\n\nGreat Hurriyat leader, Muhammad Yasin Malik was jailed for life in a fake case in a bid to silence his strong voice for Kashmir's freedom and terrorize other Kashmir leadership.\n\nThe brutal killing of freedom fighter Burhan Wani and other Kashmiri leadership in a fake encounter besides the issuance of over six million illegal domicile certificates of IIOJK to Hindus had exposed the anti-Kashmir policies of the Hinduvata's regime.\n\nHe said the gruesome violation of human rights including the forced disappearance of over 8,000 innocent Kashmiris, 8,652 unmarked mass graves, imposition of the longest curfew on some 10 million unarmed Kashmiris, extra-judicial killings and human rights abuses especially against women and children exposed India's ugly secular face before the world.\n\nAdnan Sarwar Khan, former Chairman, the International Relations Department, University of Peshawar said the illegal occupation of Kashmir valley by India had contravened multiple articles of the 30 fundamental human rights of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) drafted by representatives from all the regions of the world including India on December 10, 1948, and subsequently was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA).\n\nHe said this declaration was applied to all the signatory members of the UN including India and restrained them from all kinds of abuses, exploitation, maltreatment and violence besides violation of any fundamental rights protected in the UDHR.\n\nThe experts said that four wars were fought on the Kashmir dispute and another war would be disastrous between nuclear-armed neighbouring countries for the peace and stability of the region.\n\nThey urged UNO to come forward and implement its resolutions on Kashmir for lasting peace and stability in South Asia.",

The manifestations include: firstly, considering only their own interests at the expense of the interests of other countries; secondly, frequently showing off military force and provoking incidents in the international arena; thirdly, taking various measures to curb the rise of the emerging economies in the world; fourthly, practicing double standards on the issue of counter-terrorism, trying to destabilize other countries by 'proxy war'.\n\n\"This is a very dangerous signal that could exacerbate unrest in all parts of the world.\"\n\nHe said that in today's world, unprecedented changes were accelerating and the world was entering a new period of turbulence and transformation.\n\n\"The cold war thinking and power politics remain unresolved, with frequent regional conflicts and turbulence. Economic globalization is facing a backlash, and unilateralism and protectionism are clearly on the rise. Human society urgently hopes to overcome crisis and move towards the correct path of lasting peace and prosperity.\n\n\"In response to a series of major issues and challenges facing the world, China advocates for an equal and orderly world multi-polarization and inclusive economic globalization, which has pointed out the direction and provided a path for the international community to move towards long-term stability and achieve common development,\" he added.",

        "text": "Kashmir suffered in years that followed from this deal, as area was given to India in 1947 against will of Kashmiris\n\nThe shadowy periods of human slavery are reflected in the historical echoes of human commerce, which reverberate through the ages. The weak found themselves physically and psychologically oppressed by those whose authority, rightfully or wrongfully, became final decrees from unknown eras.\n\nThe powerful, whether individuals or states, continued to trade weaker souls for disposable commodities because they were motivated by self-aggrandizement, entrenched interests, and personal gain. Even when human civilization started along the path toward fair living conditions, people with less power and resources continued to be exploited. Despite the widespread belief that the evil practice of human slavery has been eradicated, the modern world must contend with the brutal reality of an Indian-run \"slave house\" in occupied Jammu & Kashmir. Examining the historical background reveals the disturbing deal that the British East India Company made in Amritsar on March 16, 1846, when it sold the entire province of Kashmir and its millions of inhabitants to Raja Gulab Singh Dogra of Jammu, the local ally, for a pitiful 75 lakh rupees and a few token gifts. This exchange reveals the persistent legacy of human trade in a world that appears to have progressed, evoking patterns of enslavement from the Stone Age.\n\nThe appalling Amritsar pact forced Gulab Singh to give yearly tributes to the British and assigned the Kashmiri people a value of \"2 rupees per head\". Kashmir suffered in the years that followed from this deal, as the area was given to India in 1947 against the will of the Kashmiris. Generations of Kashmiris have since suffered at the hands of India, leading to the 2016 uprising that took place in response to Burhan Wani's murder. Indian security forces have committed multiple atrocities, fatalities, and injuries as a result of the continuous struggle for self-determination. The BJP government's efforts to change the demographic composition of the region are making occupied Kashmir's situation worse.\n\nIndia has continuously violated established international conventions with its operations in IIOJK. The 1948 UNSC Resolution, which calls for a plebiscite to decide the destiny of the region, has been disregarded. In addition, India violates the Geneva Conventions, which forbid the relocation of civilian populations into occupied regions. The unilateral action to repeal Article 370 is obviously against UNSC resolutions 38, 47, 51, 91, and 122 concerning Kashmir. The 1972 Simla Agreement infringement adds to the already existing infractions and exposes a record of disdain for international commitments. The \"Jammu & Kashmir Reorganization Order 2020,\" \"Jammu & Kashmir Grant of Domicile Certificate Rules 2020,\" and \"Jammu and Kashmir Language Bill 2020\" are among the recent legislative actions by India that show a purposeful effort to change the demographic composition of IIOJ&K. It seems that the goal is to turn the area from a Muslim majority to a Hindu majority territory, weakening the region's unique identity. This deliberate action is a blatant transgression of international law, especially the guidelines provided in the Fourth Geneva Convention.\n\nSerious questions about violations of international law are raised by India's plan to host the G20 gathering in IIOJ&K. The G20 was purposefully held in a contentious region with serious human rights concerns, despite its customary concentration on commercial and financial matters. The purpose of this operation was to give the impression of peace and give international acceptance to India's efforts in IIOJK. China's, Pakistan's, and the UN Special Rapporteur on Minority Issues' opposition highlights how divisive this decision is.\n\nIn IIOJ&K, the right to obtain information is still severely curtailed since social media sites are being used as weapons to stifle content about Kashmir. Internet outages have been a standard tactic, further isolating the area and making it more difficult to record human rights abuses. It is really alarming to learn that the Indian military is allegedly using rape as a state-sponsored tactic. Numerous human rights organizations have identified a high incidence of sexual violence, which highlights the urgent need for international scrutiny and involvement. A war crime, the use of pellet weapons in IIOJ&K resulted in heavy fatalities and damage. World leaders like Juan E. M\u00e9ndez highlight the perilous circumstances in India and the world community's moral obligation to defend Muslims and other minorities.\n\nPakistan's security environment has changed, moving away from earlier worries over the Kashmir dispute and Indian aggression. A new component has evolved following the war on terror: the \"threat from the West.\" Attacks on Pakistani soldiers, terrorist operations, and the ongoing instability in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa point to a revival of Indian influence akin to the \"modern Mukti Bahini.\" An multinational network that is purportedly headed by India and backed by the US and other Western nations has disseminated false information against Pakistan, adding to a complex web of problems. Pakistan must ensure that it does not let local concerns overshadow important matters, including the Kashmir issue, in the face of pressure from the India-US alliance. The complex relationship that exists between Pakistan's survival and the state of Kashmir highlights the significance of alert diplomacy and steadfast dedication to national interests, especially in the face of outside pressure.\n\nInternational action must be swift and forceful in response to the IIOJ&K issue in order to address the atrocities, violations, and pressing need for a peaceful settlement. The international community ought to actively seek a fair and long-lasting settlement that protects the rights and dignity of the Kashmiri people, in addition to denouncing these acts. The international community must take immediate action since the settlement of the Kashmir dispute is critical to Pakistan's survival. The situation necessitates a concerted international effort to protect justice and human rights while easing the agony of the Kashmiri people.",

        "text": "China's inexorable rise continues. It is no more just a factory for the world but a muscular, aggressive power on the world stage, well on its way to super powerdom. America is unenviably retreating from its global leadership role as a whimsical president losing the grip on the world order his country built. At home he's at war with his own house. As the White House ponders its response to the attack on Tower 22, the U.S. military outpost in Jordan, the news from the Middle East could hardly be worse. From Gaza to the Red Sea and from Jordan to Iraq, a stream of unprovoked attacks by Iran and its proxies are driving President Biden into the greatest crisis of his presidency in final year. This isn't what the president or his top aides expected or hoped.\n\nThe ongoing war in Ukraine, meanwhile, shows little sign of resolution, with Republicans souring on Biden's requests for further military assistance. A looming government shutdown threatens critical programs. Republicans ousted their speaker, producing historic chaos in the House.\n\nWith Vladimir Putin as President, Russia is constantly prowling and growling on Eurasian belt and further expanding its ambit. The European Union is splintering. Since Brexit and the migration crisis, many countries in the European Union have seen the rise of a new extreme kind of nationalism, shaking the foundations of the most progressive union of nations in recent history. It is, in fact, a slap in the face of history. Turning the clock back. The Middle East remains on fire. It is plagued by ongoing Palestine-Israel conflict, which has turned into humanitarian crises with no real end in sight. It remains the bloody playground of the super powers. The Ukraine war continues as the west-backed coalition against Russia enters its second year. It is fighting a war it cannot win or afford to lose.\n\nMeanwhile, military-industrial brinkmanship is in full swing due to armed crises. Leaders are behaving as boys do with toys but with really dangerous ones. As if bent on its destruction, humanity is once again ignoring the warning signs of climate change. The World it seems cannot save the Earth. The world, in fact, has become an extremely dangerous place.\n\nThese political, humanitarian, & military conflicts trigger various conundrums we have to deal with in the years to come and how we deal with them will define the 21st century. The first conundrum is the most dangerous one that is the return of nationalism in a super connected globalized world. The forces of protectionism are rising. Country after country is throwing up barriers to trade, movement of people and even ideas. The forces that separate us are becoming stronger than those that unite us.\n\nThe second conundrum is the threat to democracy. Democracy is the cradle of freedoms but these freedoms are being diminished by political polarization, fundamentalism, majoritarianism and general intolerance. It's the rise of illiberal democracies. A kind of lumpenised democracy. Look at what's happening in our own country. Political parties are contained without being allowed to conduct election campaign freely. People are brutally maltreated for supporting the wrong kind of political party or for opposing the new king's party. Political discourse is being re-written by legal interpreters to demean common masses to discourage them from freely supporting major political party with sixty percent approval rating as apex court recent judgment on snatching election symbol from PTI has further raised apprehensions of horse trading after general elections.\n\nFake news is a virus that has infected the digital ecosystem.\n\nCandidates and their supporters are being assaulted by militants and causing hindrance to their political campaign and the bureaucracy seems to exist to serve itself and not the people. When all this happens you know democracy is in peril. And if democracy is in peril, the nation is in peril as Pakistan can be governed only as a democracy.\n\nThe third conundrum is that despite prosperity claims the great divide persists. While countries have become more prosperous with economic growth spurred by globalization and innovation, the rich have got richer and the poor poorer. Inequalities have grown across the world and Pakistan and other south Asian states are countries where inequality is the highest. The top one per cent owns more than sixty per cent of the wealth and also captures 70 per cent of new wealth created.\n\nWith widespread farmer distress and pervasive joblessness, this is a time bomb ticking in our backyard. And the alienated youth is enraged further as they see their will and vote to elect their representatives to give roadmap for financial prosperity (if any) in parliamentary system is totally undermined. Thus, future course of action will be dominated by the overt challenge that is to have equity with growth while not punishing the wealth creators.\n\nSocial media too is a double edged sword. It can be used for evil or good. It gives everyone the freedom to express an opinion but that freedom is threatened as organizations use troll armies to denigrate those who disagree with them. But it also allows for greater social activism exposing those who wear the cloak of civility for the barbarians they actually are like MeToo, TimesUp movements etc. and most recently Israel's barbarity against Palestinian people which triggered widespread boycott and protests across both hemispheres.\n\nThe other irony is that, with Google, we live in a time when the world's knowledge is at our fingertips and the truth is easily verifiable. But the truth is constantly on trial. Fake news is a virus that has infected the digital ecosystem. And there is no cure in sight. Regulating these tech giants will be a big challenge in the years to come.\n\nAmid all these aforementioned paradoxes, record-breaking 40-plus countries, from Russia to South Africa, India to the US, representing more than 40% of the world's population and an outsized chunk of global GDP, are due to hold national elections in 2024. The outcomes, taken separately and together, will help determine who controls and directs the 21st century world.\n\nCasting lots in this multinational, multiparty democratic Super Bowl are some of the most powerful and wealthiest states (the US, India, the UK), some of the weakest (South Sudan, Pakistan), and most stressed (Russia, Iran). Some elections will be open, free and fair, many less so. Some will not be free at all. Paradoxically, this unprecedented vote-fest comes at a moment when the world economy is lumbering from one shock to another as two brutal wars, stubborn inflation and high borrowing costs hold back the post-pandemic recovery.\n\nStarted with Taiwan in January and running through the US presidential election in November, there is a busy line-up even in chaotic political times. Thus, 2024 is set to become the most significant election year in history. India, United States, Russia, United Kingdom, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Mexico, South Africa are among the key players in the 40 nation election.\n\nTo Be Continued",

        "text": "POST-Ram temple India is another country where a new religious edifice has become a flashpoint as social injustices rise. Days after its consecration, the BJP government, determined to make Muslims, their heritage and history invisible, looked away as Hindutva groups and mobs unleashed atrocities against the community across 'saffron Bharat'. Once again, the turmoil reached ancient mosques -- the same week an Indian court allowed Hindus to perform rituals inside the disputed 17th-century Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi that was built by the Mughals; Hindu litigants claim it replaced a Shiva temple. Subsequently, the 13th-century Akhunji mosque, madressah and graveyard in Delhi's historic Mehrauli area were wiped out in the dead of the night, leaving the muezzin homeless. While authorities say it was an 'illegal structure', top Muslim leaders have urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to halt mosque versus temple disputes. These atrocities are a sign of the times: the far-right narrative of many old mosques being temples that were destroyed by Muslim monarchs, despite historians refuting it due to scarce material evidence, is louder and more potent. Hence, in a landscape marked by Hindutva war cries, the breakneck speed of the sociocultural homogenisation under RSS-BJP rule begs a question: has the opening of the temple in Ayodhya declared war on Muslims?\n\nAs Mr Modi stokes communal fires to clinch a third term in power and level Jawaharlal Nehru's score, his India is the antithesis of the Nehruvian vision -- a modern, non-aligned nation centred on secularism, social justice and democracy. But, radical Hindutva forces have either altered this vision beyond recognition or abandoned it. Although the UN has been approached by Pakistan to take action for the protection of Islamic sites in India, the BJP appears resolute about blurring the lines between politics and religion, weaponising history and monuments and reducing Muslims to what they eat and wear. The fresh wave of saffron violence is not without a message: Mr Modi's India will be built on the debris of communal harmony. There are stages to the erasure of Muslim inheritance and culture -- neglect, oppress and destroy -- translating into serious consequences for decades of diversity and pluralism. The bigger blow for Indian Muslims is that institutions and the security apparatus are letting them down, thereby endorsing the chants of a Hindu 'rashtra' and acts of majoritarian abuse.",

However, their resilience in the face of adversity is a testament to the indomitable human spirit.\n\nCaretaker Federal Minister for Religious Affairs & Interfaith Harmony Aneeq Ahmed in a statement on the eve of the Kashmir Solidarity Day which is being observed on Feb 5, 2024 (today) condemned the Indian government's hypocrisy and said on one hand it called itself the biggest democracy and defender of human rights while on the other hand, it denies the same to the people of the IIOJ&K.\n\n\"While they preach secularism, they perpetuate a brutal occupation, silencing dissent and suppressing the aspirations of an entire population,\" said the interim religious affairs & interfaith harmony minister.\n\nKashmir is not a territorial dispute, said the minister, adding it is a humanitarian crisis and our collective voice must echo in the corridors of power, demanding an end to the suffering and a just resolution for the people of Kashmir.

This day is not merely a date on the calendar; it is a testament to our unwavering commitment to justice, peace, and the right to self-determination.\"\n\nWe stand shoulder to shoulder with them, echoing their cry for freedom -- a cry that reverberates across the valleys and mountains of the beautiful land of Kashmir, he said.\n\nThe abrogation of Article 370 and 35A by the Indian government not only violated international agreements but also intensified the suffering of the Kashmiri people, the minister said adding \"The people of Kashmir have been subjected to prolonged curfews, communication blackouts, and a heavy military presence, creating an environment of fear and uncertainty.\"\n\nSuch actions are not only a violation of basic human rights but also contradict the principles of justice and equality, Aneeq Ahmed said.\n\nAccording to him, the United Nations Charter enshrines the right to self-determination -- a right that belongs to every human being, regardless of their ethnicity, religion, or geographical location.\n\nIt is imperative that India let the Kashmiris exercise their right to self-determination through a free and impartial plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations without further prevarication, he said adding, \"As an 'Ambassador of Kashmir,' I reassure our Kashmiri brothers and sisters that Pakistan will continue to extend all possible support. We will raise our voice on international platforms, advocate for their rights, and stand firm against any attempts to suppress their struggle. It is our duty as a nation to condemn these injustices and stand in solidarity with our Kashmiri brothers and sisters.

        "text": "LAHORE, (UrduPoint / Pakistan Point News - 4th Feb, 2024) Political experts and analysts have urged the international community, particularly the UN, to stand up for the oppressed people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), who are facing the worst and most brutal violations of their human rights in the internationally recognized disputed territory.\n\nPolitical experts and analysts said on Sunday that Kashmir had been a burning issue since the Partition of the Indian Subcontinent in 1947. Pakistan and India have fought three wars over Kashmir in 1948, 1965, and 1999, but have been unable to settle the dispute.\n\nAfter the Partition of Indian Subcontinent, millions of Kashmiris felt unsafe and uncertain about their fate. They were required to accede to either of the two countries on the basis of wishes of their people and the geographical location.\n\nSince 1947, Article 370 had given Jammu and Kashmir a semi-autonomous constitutional status.\n\nEarlier, under its provisions, the region had freedom in all matters except its constitution, legislature, flag, foreign affairs, communications and defence. Anger has simmered in the region and the situation further worsened when Narendra Modi-led regime on August 5, 2019 abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, by repealing articles 370 and 35-A.\n\nMeanwhile, Modi-led BJP government imposed a lockdown in the occupied Kashmir, allowing Indian forces to perpetrate unspeakable crimes against the masses, with complete impunity. In IIOJK, the All Parties Hurriyat Conference and other bodies have strongly condemned the Modi-led fascist Indian government for forcibly implementing secret and nefarious agenda by usurping all fundamental rights of the people of Kashmir, including social, political, economic and religious rights.\n\nEnding the old status of Kashmir is an attempt to usurp the rights of Kashmiri people by eradicating their fundamental rights related to their social, linguistic, cultural, economic and political existence, former chairperson HRCP told APP. By abrogating the Article-370 and Article-35A, Indian parliament illegally allowed non-Kashmiris to resettle in Kashmir permanently. Whereas actually, the Constitution of Kashmir first defines membership and settlement. According to this amendment, non-Kashmiris are now allowed to buy property, keep it and settle in Kashmir permanently, the sources said. According to the current change, regarding land as a sole property, will not allow them to live on land as they have historically been doing. These changes will also subject to population-rearrangement in Kashmir, they informed while replying to a query.\n\nMoreover, the Indian forces were using rape, molestation and sexual violence against women and children as a weapon of war, besides collective punishment, in a bid to suppress the legitimate freedom movement in the occupied valley,\" they said.\n\nUnfortunately, Kashmiris have speculated since decades, that India intends to settle paramilitary families and military settlements there, as well as establishment of semi-permanent military colonies in Kashmir. Indigenous Kashmiris, have long faced threats to their existence as well as their inherited rights, especially 'relative' land rights. This will make indigenous peoples aliens.\n\nFormer senator from Pakistan People's Party (PPP), Sehar Kamran (TI), told APP that the latest controversy had been reported by international media that extrajudicial-murders of a number of Kashmiris have become a routine in the Kulgam area of the occupied territory. Cruelty knows no bounds, and after the men were gunned down, their bodies were not returned to their families, she condemned adding that New Dehli was losing the battle of hearts and minds in occupied Kashmir.\n\nThe Indian occupational forces' state terrorism, war crimes and human rights violations had made life a nightmare for over one million oppressed Kashmiris, especially women, senior citizens and children in IIOJK , she remarked.\n\nViolating all fundamental rights, India had imposed military siege on some 10 million Kashmiris in IIOJK, by converting the territory into biggest jail on earth, where over 900,000 Indian forces had been deployed with no regards for human rights, she lamented.\n\nSince 1989, she said, the Indian occupational forces had committed worst crimes, as more than 162,000 Kashmiris had been subjected to inhuman torture, including beatings with iron rods, stripping naked, heavy roller treatment, hanging from ceiling, electrocution, burning of the body with iron rods, sleep deprivation, solitary confinement, sexualised torture including rape, molestation and sodomy.\n\nHowever, the apathy and hypocrisy of other countries by keeping mum over India's atrocities in IIOJK due to their economic interests is an eye-opener for the global champions of human rights.",

Deeply saddened to inform you that we have lost our beloved Poonam to cervical cancer.

Extreme, I know. But suddenly we all are talking about cervical cancer, aren't we?\" Pandey said. \"I am proud of what my death news has been able to achieve.\"\n\n\"Unlike some other cancers, cervical cancer is entirely preventable.

        "text": "PAKISTAN'S national security has lately been under threat on its eastern as well as western borders. On the eastern frontier, India's attitude towards Pakistan has unfortunately hit a new low. The Modi regime is constantly innovating prickly ways to assert its growing hubris in the neighbourhood and beyond. Its latest practice is to deploy assassins on foreign lands to kill so-called anti-India elements. The evidence shows that Indian intelligence operatives managed to have not only Mohammad Riaz and Shahid Latif assassinated on Pakistani soil, but many more Pakistani citizens too, for which investigations are underway. This is in line with what Indian operatives did in Canada and the US when they targeted Sikhs calling for an independent state of Khalistan.\n\nUsing assassins to kill on foreign soil is a variant of the earlier policy of sending in Indian operatives, such as Kulbhushan Jadhav, who would enter Pakistan under fake identities to destabilise the country. However, the cause of regional peace will not be served if India continues to commit state terrorism while accusing Pakistan of cross-border terrorism. Both countries would do well to eliminate transnational terrorism through cooperation rather than confrontation.\n\nPakistan's western frontiers are also in the grip of cross-border terrorism. Last month, Iran attacked a target inside Pakistan, ostensibly to eliminate an alleged hideout of Jaish al-Adl, an anti-Iran Sunni militant group active in Sistan-Baluchestan. Pakistan responded with a strike against Baloch terrorist elements in the border town of Saravan. Both governments swiftly resolved the matter through diplomacy. But soon after, nine Pakistanis were murdered in Saravan. The Iranian foreign minister has since visited Pakistan to calm tensions. Ultimately, the root cause, which is the alleged presence of terrorist elements on both sides of the border, would need to be addressed to avert the recurrence of such incidents.\n\nEver since the Taliban came to power in Kabul in 2021, the TTP has been reinvigorated. The group had been beaten in operations in Swat, South Waziristan and North Waziristan as well as the countrywide intelligence-based operation Raddul Fasaad. The TTP's resurgence resulted from the Afghan Taliban rulers' release of TTP prisoners in the name of facilitating talks with Pakistan. A tentative ceasefire was agreed to, leading to senior TTP leaders being freed from prisons in Pakistan and the resettlement of hundreds of TTP fighters in the country.\n\nA detailed review is needed of our security and foreign policies.\n\nInstead of appreciating the gesture, the TTP used the opportunity to regroup and resume its attacks against targets in Pakistan, particularly the security forces. Despite this setback, Islamabad has, prudently, maintained its contacts with Kabul at multiple levels to stress that Afghanistan's strategic interests would be better served if Kabul restricted the space given to the TTP for cross-border terrorism, and reoriented its policies to focus on peace and development.\n\nEver since the launch of CPEC in 2015, Pakistan's detractors have tried to carry out acts of terrorism against Chinese nationals working on CPEC projects here. At the request of China, Pakistan's steadfast friend, the government constituted a strong force to safeguard CPEC projects and Chinese nationals. This has improved the security situation, although occasional terrorist attacks still occur.\n\nAll this requires an in-depth review of our security and foreign policies. An opportunity will arise when a new government is elected this month. After holding consultations with think tanks, academia, and intelligentsia, the elected government must institute a mechanism to undertake such a review on a new agenda of peace that should be pursued with not only our neighbours but also other powers of relevance to Pakistan.\n\nRecently, a national conference was convened in Islamabad by the Sanober Institute in collaboration with two partners from academia and the think tank community to prepare a strategy manifesto for the new government with recommendations for Pakistan's security and foreign policies. Similar efforts are currently underway in several universities and think tanks, born of a desire to see our country achieve the glory that Pakistan's founder had envisioned for it.\n\nBased on the Quaid's advice, and the imperative to stabilise its borders, Pakistan must address the internal and external reasons of militancy. Internally, militant, extremist, sectarian and sub-nationalist forces need to be dealt with politically first, and kinetically later if required. Externally, we should engage with all neighbours such that it builds their stakes in Pakistan's stability. In the medium to long term, this approach can ensure border stability and progress.",

        "text": "Critics have been accusing the Indian government of using law enforcement agencies to selectively target its political foes following the arrest of an opposition politician minutes after his resignation as a state Chief Minister.\n\nHemant Soren leads one of several opposition parties that have allied to challenge Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in elections this year.\n\nHe began Wednesday as the leader of Jhark-hand, which with an estimated 40 million people has a bigger population than Canada. By the evening he had stepped down and was in custody for allegedly facilitating an illegal land sale.\n\nJagdeep Chhokar, co-founder of local transparency watchdog the Association for Democratic Reforms, said Soren's guilt or innocence was secondary to his status as an opponent of the ruling party.\n\n\"No politician is squeaky clean,\" he said. \"But it is evident from what is happening that oppo-sition leaders are being threatened by law enforce-ment agencies.\"\n\nSoren's detention was the first arrest of a chief minister for more than a decade, but he is only the latest opposition politician to face criminal investi-gations and charges since Modi won power in 2014.\n\nCongress party leader Rahul Gandhi was con-victed of criminal libel last year after a complaint by a member of Modi's party.\n\nHis two-year prison sentence saw him disqualified from parliament for a time until the verdict was suspended by a higher court, but raised concerns over democratic norms in the country.\n\nArvind Kejriwal, leader of the Aam Aadmi Party -- another member of the opposition alliance and chief minister of the capital region Delhi, has repeatedly been summoned by investigators probing alleged corruption in the allocation of liquor licences.\n\nBut Mmhonlumo Kikon, a spokes\u00adman for BJP, said that India's law enforcement agencies worked to their independent mandate.\n\n\"BJP does not interfere in any way,\" he said. Jharkhand's Hemant Soren was detained after a year-long probe during which he maintained his innocence and accused the BJP of using investiga-tors to sideline him.\n\n\"I will not bow down,\" he said in a Wednesday video message recorded before his arrest. \"Truth will prevail.\"\n\nDetails of the evidence against Soren have yet to emerge. Local media reports said investigators had raided his official residence earlier this week and seized two luxury cars and more than $40,000 in cash.\n\nIndia's main financial investigation agency has ongoing probes against at least four other chief ministers or their families, all of whom belong to the BJP's political opponents. But other investigations have been dropped against erstwhile rivals who later switched their allegiance to the BJP.\n\nHimanta Biswa Sarma, the current chief minis-ter of Assam, was accused by investigators of participating in a lucrative pyramid scam, but has not been interrogated since joining the BJP eight years ago.\n\nSimilarly, former Maharashtra chief minister Narayan Rane was accused of money laundering, but has not been summoned for questioning by investigators since merging his party with the BJP in 2019.\n\nNews organisations and non-profit groups have also found themselves subject to investigations since Modi took office.\n\nLast year tax authorities raided the BBC offices and seized electronic devices after the British broadcaster aired a documentary investigating Modi's role in 2002 communal riots when he was Gujarat's chief minister. -- AFP",

        "text": "NEW YORK, Feb 03 (APP): After \"blurring\" the lines between Hinduism and the state, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is now on track to become the first Indian prime minister since Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru to win three consecutive terms, Bob Drogin, a prominent American journalist, wrote in The Los Angeles Times.\n\n\"When Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the consecration of a vast new Hindu temple atop the ruins of a demolished Muslim mosque in the town of Ayodhya in northern India last week, it showed how far he will go to secure his reelection this year,\" said Drogin, who was LA Times' correspondent in New Delhi in the 90s.\n\nIn his opinion piece, Drogin said that he witnessed the destruction of the mosque in Ayodhya and was \"clubbed\" by police as they dispersed foreign journalists covering the event.\n\nThe article said: \"Not that stoking religious strife is a new tactic for the 73-year-old Modi. He rode to power, and clings to it now, on the back of militant Hindu nationalism and the menace of anti-Muslim violence. In 2005, Modi, then the top official in the Indian state of Gujarat, became the first and only person ever barred from entering the United States under a little-known immigration law that makes foreign officials ineligible for visas if they are responsible for 'particularly severe violations of religious freedom.'\n\n\"U.S. officials had determined that Modi stood by during Hindu riots that killed more than 1,000 Muslims in Gujarat state in 2002. The visa ban was lifted only when he became prime minister in 2014. Today Modi's brand of militant Hindu supremacy has replaced political pluralism as India's dominant ideology, threatening the nation's status as a secular republic. As a foreign correspondent for the Los Angeles Times, I saw the beginnings of India's anti-democratic slide on a sunny day in December 1992, on the contested ground in Ayodhya.\n\n\"Thousands of Hindu pilgrims, white-bearded priests, dhoti-clad holy men and other devotees who had gathered for a political rally suddenly stormed the historic Babri mosque, built in the 16th century by Babur, the first Mughal emperor, on the site of the supposed birthplace of the Hindu deity Ram. The Hindu mob tore the mosque apart, brick by brick, with pikes, pickaxes and their bare hands. They pulled down guard towers with grappling hooks and climbed barefoot over barbed wire barricades. Foreign journalists were chased and clubbed. I was whacked with bamboo and hit with a brick.\n\n\"The destruction of the mosque set off some of its worst religious pogroms in India since independence in 1947. Entire Muslim neighborhoods were torched and families slaughtered. A Newsweek cover famously warned of 'Holy War' on the subcontinent; its rival Time deemed the communal violence an 'Unholy War.'\n\nThree-plus decades later, much of India came to a standstill on January 22 to watch as Modi consecrated Ram Mandir, a richly decorated $220-million temple built over the destroyed Babri mosque. In many Indian states, it was a public holiday. Stock markets and most schools and offices were closed. Government offices shut for half a day. Nonstop TV coverage showed the prime minister placing a lotus flower by the jet-black Ram idol in the temple's inner sanctum, prostrating himself before it and all but declaring Hinduism a state religion. An Indian Air Force helicopter dropped flower petals outside, priests blew conches and chanted, but Modi was the star.\n\n\" 'Ram is the faith of India, the foundation of India,' he told a rapt crowd in Hindi, according to the Times of India. 'Ram is the thought of India, Ram is the law of India. ... Ram is the policy [of India].' Modi has become the 'high priest of Hinduism,' the prime minister's biographer, Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, told the Indian website Rediff.com after the ceremony. 'We are very close to becom[ing] a theocratic state.'\n\n\"Such a notion would be anathema to India's once revered founding leaders, Mohandas K. Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru. Government should embrace all religions, not impose one over the others, they argued. Those secular values are enshrined in the Indian constitution.\n\n\"But secularism has waned as Modi's right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party has steadily gained power by blurring the lines between Hinduism and the state. Muslims have their own countries, Modi's supporters argue. Why shouldn't we?\n\nHere's why: Although 80% of India's 1.4 billion people identify as Hindu, 200 million Muslims and tens of millions of Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and others do not.\n\n\"Human rights groups say non-Hindus are increasingly treated like second-class citizens. Modi's 'government has adopted laws and policies that discriminate against religious minorities, especially Muslims,' Human Rights Watch warns on its website. 'This ... has emboldened Hindu nationalist groups to target members of minority communities or civil society groups with impunity.'\n\n\"In the days since Modi presided over the temple rituals in Ayodhya, Hindu mobs rampaged in several cities and towns. News reports tallied the damage: Muslim-owned shops were destroyed in Mumbai, Muslim students were beaten in Pune, a Muslim graveyard burned in Bihar and so on. Modi doesn't need to inflame anti-Muslim prejudice to win reelection. He has a 76% approval rating in the latest polls and is on track to become the first Indian prime minister since Nehru to win three consecutive terms.",

India and Pakistan were both created after the British colonial period, leading to several conflicts and disputes over the years. In recent times, the conflict has escalated, with both countries enhancing their military capabilities and engaging in skir\u00admishes along the border. Accord\u00ading to the South Asia Terrorism Portal, there were 155 incidents of violence along the India-Paki\u00adstan border in 2020, resulting in the deaths of 34 security person\u00adnel and 28 civilians.\n\nIndia and Pakistan share a long and complex history, having been part of the same territory until the partition of British India in 1947. The partition resulted in the cre\u00adation of two independent coun\u00adtries, India and Pakistan, with the latter divided into East and West Pakistan (later becoming Bangla\u00addesh). The partition witnessed large-scale violence, with commu\u00adnal riots causing the deaths of hun\u00addreds of thousands.\n\nSeveral factors have contribut\u00aded to the escalation of tensions be\u00adtween India and Pakistan. One main factor is the Kashmir issue, a region claimed by both countries. Accord\u00ading to the Jammu and Kashmir Co\u00adalition of Civil Society, more than 70,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Kashmir since 1989. The dispute over Kashmir has been a long-standing source of tension, leading to both countries deploy\u00ading military forces along the bor\u00adder and engaging in skirmishes and cross-border firing.\n\nAnother factor is the rise of na\u00adtionalism in both countries, with political leaders and the media pro\u00admoting a strong and aggressive for\u00adeign policy towards the other coun\u00adtry. This has led to an increase in military spending and the devel\u00adopment of new weapons systems, raising concerns about the possi\u00adbility of a nuclear conflict between the two countries. According to the Stockholm International Peace Re\u00adsearch Institute, India's military expenditure in 2020 was $72.9 billion, while Pakistan's military ex\u00adpenditure was $11.1 billion.\n\nIt is essential to promote dia\u00adlogue and diplomacy between In\u00addia and Pakistan to address the security challenge in South Asia. Confidence-building measures such as trade and cultural ex\u00adchanges can help reduce tensions and build trust between the two countries. It is also important for the international community to play a more active role in resolv\u00ading the conflict, with countries such as the United States, China, and Russia using their influence to encourage both countries to en\u00adgage in dialogue.",

Wani pointed to the Indian security forces' growing interference in residents' private lives, citing databases created since 2019 targeting journalists, academicians, civil society, and human rights activists documenting violations committed by the Indian army.\n\nReferring to past surveys, Wani noted that in the 1990s, the Indian army and Border Security Force conducted door-to-door surveys to maintain a database and monitor residents' movements to gather information on resistance groups. Terming the current campaign illegal, unconstitutional, and against international law, Wani cited India's Census Act, which strictly prohibits agencies, public or private, from conducting such exercises independently.\n\nWani highlighted that the census drive violated India's own law, infringing upon citizens' fundamental rights to privacy and dignity. He emphasized that this unconstitutional expansion of police powers aimed to turn the occupied territory into a surveillance state, negatively impacting fundamental freedoms and human rights while allowing unjustified interferences into citizens' private lives. Seeking immediate UN attention and intervention, the Chairman KIIR urged the SecretaryGeneral to stop this illegal campaign, protecting Kashmiri people from the dangers of intrusive mass surveillance by the Indian government.",

        "text": "A former CIA software engineer who embarrassed his employer by allegedly giving a massive trove of classified information to WikiLeaks has been sentenced to 40 years in prison by a New York judge.\n\nUS District Court Judge Jesse Furman handed down the sentence against Joshua Schulte on Thursday, falling short of the life prison term that federal prosecutors had requested. Schulte, who was accused of carrying out the largest theft of US secrets in the CIA's history, was convicted on charges of espionage, computer hacking, contempt of court, making false statements to the FBI, and possessing child pornography.\n\nRead more: Modi Regime Bans Anti-Muslim Hate Crime Trackers\n\nSchulte, 35, was allegedly the source behind the so-called Vault 7 release by WikiLeaks in 2017, which exposed the methods used by the CIA to hack smartphones and other devices. The bombshell report exposed how the US spied on foreign governments, terrorism suspects and other targets, creating a major embarrassment for Washington's intelligence agencies. It also reportedly triggered a secret CIA plot to kidnap or assassinate WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.\n\nPrior to his arrest in 2018, Schulte had helped create the hacking tools that he later exposed to WikiLeaks. The CIA tactics included efforts to turn so-called smart TVs - televisions with online connectivity - into listening devices. Prosecutors claimed he was behind \"the most damaging disclosures of classified information in American history.\"\n\nSchulte argued during his July 2022 trial that the CIA and FBI were making him a scapegoat for a humiliating leak of data that could have been stolen by hundreds of other people. He claimed, too, that he had no motive to carry out such a leak. During Thursday's sentencing hearing, he complained of horrible conditions in his New York jail cell, which he called a \"torture cage,\" and he said prosecutors were seeking \"vengeance\" after previously offering him a plea bargain calling for a 10-year prison sentence.\n\nRead more: US lawmakers win apology from Zuckerberg in tech grilling\n\nFurman found that Schulte was motivated by \"anger, spite and perceived grievance\" against his CIA bosses after they ignored his complaints about working conditions. After being jailed in 2018, the ex-programmer continued trying to leak classified materials in what prosecutors called an \"information war\" with the US government, the judge said.\n\nWhile executing a search warrant in the espionage case, FBI investigators allegedly found an encrypted cache of more than 3,000 images and videos depicting child sexual abuse on Schulte's home computer, according to prosecutors. More than six years of his 40-year prison sentence stemmed from the pornography charges.\n\nAlthough Furman didn't grant the request by the US Department of Justice to imprison Schulte for life, he did agree to apply a \"terrorism enhancement,\" a legal provision that allows harsher sentences for terrorism-related offenses.\n\nAssange, who has been jailed in London since 2019 while fighting extradition to the US, faces up to 175 years in prison on 17 espionage charges.",

        "text": "Chairman Kashmir Institute of International Relations Altaf Hussain Wani has urged the UN secretary general Mr. Antonio Gutters to help stop illegal profiling campaign, initiated under the guise of the census, by police in the Indian held territory of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nIn his joint letter addressed to the UN secretary general and other UN special rapporteurs Wani, while highlighting the illegal, unconstitutional and human rights aspects of the move, said, \"The lack of transparency in this campaign, which was launched without a formal announcement of the competent authorities, has unsettled people of the region who have already been living under heightened fear and insecurity since the Modi government stripped the region of its special status in a brazen violation of the UNSC resolutions\".\n\nHe said that under the guise of census sensitive information was being obtained from residents that included the details of head of family and family members living outside the region, along with their ages and contact details.\n\nHe pointed out that the \"census forms\" distributed amongst the residents also obtain exclusive details of residents including Aadhar numbers, vehicle registration numbers and information about CCTV cameras installed and enquires about family members associated with the ongoing freedom struggle.\n\nHe said that residents were being asked to provide photographs and longitude and latitude coordinates (geo-tagging) of their residencies.\n\n\"This insidious campaign, which lacks transparency, has raised serious concerns amongst the Kashmiri people who are already living in a state of excessive surveillance\", the letter said, adding that the invasive nature of the questions, sensitive data gathering by the police have left residents completely shell-shocked.\n\nReferring to the Indian security forces' growing interference into the residents' private lives, the letter pointed out that since 2019 Indian security agencies have been involved in creating databases of prominent citizens especially journalists, academicians, civil society and human rights activists who played a key role in documenting human rights violations committed by the Indian army and other security agencies.\n\nHe said that the Indian army had conducted similar surveys in the past as well. \"In the 1990s, the Indian army and the Border Security Force conducted door-to-door surveys to maintain a database of all households and monitor the movements of residents to gather information on resistance groups\", he added.\n\nTerming these insidious campaign as illegal, unconstitutional and against the spirit of international law, Wani said, \"India's own law strictly prohibits the police or any other agency, public or private, from carrying out such an exercise on its own\".\n\nReferring to the India's Census Act, he said that according to the Actonly the office of Registrar General of India and Registrar of Census was authorized to conduct a census in the country or in a particular region or state.\n\n\"The Census Act 1948 not only guarantees the confidentiality of information provided by respondents during the census but specifically prohibits other agencies from conducting the census or population enumeration themselves\", he said.\n\n\" Even the law does not allow this information to be provided as evidence in court\", he said.\n\n\"The so-called census drive, which enables the government to create a detailed profile of each individual, not only runs counter to India's own law but also blatantly violates people's fundamental rights to privacy and dignity.\n\nThe move, he said, was an unconstitutional expansion of police powers and an attempt to turn the occupied territory of Jammu and Kashmir into a surveillance state.\n\nThe creation of a database of an entire population by the Indian security agencies, he said, was not just a violation of fundamental rights of the people but this intrusive mass surveillance mechanism would negatively affect the citizens' fundamental freedoms and other human rights in addition to opening up floodgates for unjustified interferences into citizens' private lives.\n\nSeeking the UN Secretary General's immediate attention and intervention in this matter, the KIIR chief appealed the UN SG to help stop this illegal campaign to protect the people of Kashmir from the dangers of this intrusive mass surveillance scheme launched by the Indian government.",

        "title": "India's hybrid warfare",
        "text": "First, hybrid warfare represents limitations of military means in protracted conflicts, especially when it seeks to eradicate idea of self-determination that is rooted as much in history as it is in socio-cultural\n\nThe term 'hybrid warfare' refers to a combination of traditional military means and the use of non-military resources deployed to achieve broader military and strategic objectives. That which cannot be achieved through the use of hard power should be won by all other means.\n\nThe decision to employ hybrid warfare as a preferred policy follows the failure of the conventional military force especially in situations of foreign occupation and colonization where the occupying forces are unable to suppress the collective aspirations of an indigenous people.\n\nTwo factors stand out. First, hybrid warfare represents the limitations of the military means in protracted conflicts, especially when it seeks to eradicate the idea of self-determination that is rooted as much in history as it is in the socio-cultural, political and religious identity of a colonized people.\n\nSecond, it aims to undermine the consensus on the collective ideas of identity and self-determination by spreading confusion, deepening divisions and manufacturing consent. The principal objective here is to break the will of the nation through the manipulation of information.\n\nThe longstanding Jammu and Kashmir dispute, an unfinished agenda of Partition in 1947, is the most relevant example of the heroic defiance of a people who have refused to bow down to the Indian policy of intimidation, naked use of force, enforced disappearances and occupation.\n\nDubbed as one of the most militarized zones in the world, which the experts believe is a nuclear flashpoint in South Asia, Indian illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) is a place where the Indian hybrid warfare model, of which information manipulation is a major plank, is being put to its worst use by the Hindutva-inspired Modi government.\n\nThe BJP, which has long wanted to change the ideological orientation of India, is on a mission to refashion India as a Hindu-only country. It is, therefore, in the fitness of things to suggest that its actions in IIOJK that ended the limited autonomy afforded to the state of Jammu and Kashmir in August 2019 need to be analysed from the perspective of information warfare that is now in full play in the restive valley.\n\nIn the contemporary information age, the significance of narrative power cannot be overstated. Hybrid warfare strategically leverages the influence of the information era, employing tactics like disinformation, fake news, cyberattacks, and media manipulation to shape perceptions and twist opinions. A case in point is India's attempt to portray a semblance of normality during the G-20 tourism working group meeting held in IIOJK in 2023.\n\nIn 2021, India was caught running a clandestine network of disinformation by EU DisinfoLab. It also arranged stage-managed tours for members of the European Parliament to give an impression of 'normalcy' in IIOJK. The idea here was to sell the notion to the international diplomatic community that the Kashmir Question was settled after the withdrawal of the statehood of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThe recent decision by the Indian Supreme Court whereby it legitimized all actions of the Modi government taken on August 5, 2019 is also linked to the same chain, which seeks to present the Kashmir Question as an internal affair of India in an attempt to escape international criticism of its actions.\n\nThe Modi government's implementation of a controversial media policy in June 2020 granted authorities additional powers to strengthen their control over the narrative, exacerbating the limitations on press freedom. Kashmiri journalists who have braved incarcerations, torture, and dismissals from their jobs serve as stark examples of the ruthless implementation of this information warfare strategy. Even after temporary releases, most of these journalists encountered prompt rearrests, with oppressive measures like the Public Safety Act being utilized to curtail journalistic freedom. This recurrent pattern of intimidation and retribution highlights a troubling state of the press in IIOJK at the hands of Indian authorities.\n\nConstraints imposed on local media outlets serve as a calculated manoeuvre to regulate the dissemination of information. Indian authorities aim to shape a narrative by restricting access to authentic reporting through credible journalists.\n\nDespite claiming leadership in the field of information technology, India has carried out repeated internet shutdowns in IIOJK. It has strictly regulated the flow of information, especially on social media platforms through a series of measures, which involve arbitrary arrests of journalists on terrorism charges, and the shutdown of news outlets remotely seen to be critical of the Modi government. India represents a perfect example of a country that has methodically employed disinformation and fake news to construct an alternate reality to avoid global censure for its systematic erosion of press freedoms.\n\nThe deliberate removal of critical articles from websites serves as additional evidence of the intentional manipulation of information to align with a 'curated' version of events. This trend of information manipulation is further complemented by the spread of ghost articles, news reports and opinion editorials through leading Indian news agencies to give them an air of 'credibility'. The implementation of travel bans on journalists critical of the Modi regime and the shuttering of the press clubs collectively illustrate a systematic endeavour to isolate the region from international scrutiny.\n\nWhat to speak of local news organizations, even the respected international media outlets such as the BBC are not safe from the Indian government's high-handedness. The raids on the BBC offices by the Indian tax authorities in New Delhi and Mumbai in what seemed to be in retaliation for screening the documentary titled 'India: The Modi Question' show the depth to which the BJP government could stoop.\n\nThis is but one example of deteriorating media freedom, establishing the extent of manipulating information as part of larger hybrid information warfare to reshape the reality of Modi's India and give an impression of 'all being well' in IIJOK.\n\nThe story of India's information warfare will be incomplete without mentioning the increasing cyber threats. New Delhi has consistently resorted to undertaking surveillance, smear campaigns, character assassinations and harassment of 'errant' journalists through the use of draconian laws such as the Public Safety Act and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.\n\nThe disclosure of a substantial data breach, revealing the exposure of personally identifiable information belonging to 815 million Indians, highlights significant weaknesses in data security. The compromised data, which includes Aadhaar card numbers, passport information, names, phone numbers, and addresses, being offered for sale on the dark web constitutes a severe breach of privacy, prompting serious concerns over the safeguarding of sensitive personal information.\n\nIn IIOJK, where the Modi government is implementing a series of measures to dilute the Muslim majority by arranging the settlement of non-domicile holders from across India, the distribution of Aadhaar cards becomes an even more delicate matter. The fact that such sensitive information can be exploited presents substantial risks to the safety and security of the local population.\n\nComplementing information warfare is the cunning, nay mischievous, use of Indian cinema to dehumanize Kashmiris. Movies like 'The Kashmir Files' represent a shrewd attempt at curating a narrative along the lines of anti-Muslim prejudice that borders on outright hostility. This increasing trend of highly 'nationalistic' films not only tends to glorify the current Indian leadership but also legitimizes structural and physical violence by equating Muslims with terrorists.\n\nFor a society that is plagued by the ever-widening fault lines, these misrepresentations of Muslims in general and Kashmiri Muslims in particular, are leading to consequences that go beyond the screens and are reshaping the consciousness of people by further poisoning the environment of hate, discrimination and isolation.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON: The US government has held back delivery of 31 MQ-9A Sea Guardian and Sky Guardian drones to India until New Delhi carries out a \"meaningful investigation\" into the conspiracy to assassinate famous Sikh leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.\n\nPannun, who holds dual US and Canadian citizenship, is a New York-based Khalistan activist accused by India of terrorism.\n\nThe proposed $3 billion purchase includes 15 Sea Guardian drones for the Indian Navy, while the Indian Air Force and Army are supposed to get eight Sky Guardian drones each.\n\nAlso held back by Washington are smaller Indian acquisitions, including a proposal to buy Six Boeing P-81 long0range maritime patrol aircraft. These are to supplement 12 P-8I Poseidon aircraft that the Indian Navy already operates.\n\nIronically, the Indian Ministry of Defence's internal approval for the now-stalled drone procurement came in June 2023, a week before Prime Minister Narendra Modi's state visit to Washington. This was also the time when the conspiracy to kill Pannun - allegedly set in motion by an Indian security official named CC1, according to a federal indictment made public last November - shifted to high gear.\n\n\"The purchase is stuck in the US Congress because of anger over the brazen attempt to assassinate Pannun. US representatives have frozen the legislative movement needed for proceeding with the sale,\" a highly-placed source in Washington told The Wire website.\n\nExplaining the delay in delivering these lethal, long-range weapons to India, the Washington-based source says that Indian-American lawmakers in particular are deeply concerned about the fallout from the indictment of an Indian named Nikhil Gupta. He has been formally charged with conspiring to kill Pannun, and is currently in detention in the Czech Republic pending his deportation to the US.\n\nIn a joint statement on the Pannun plot last December, five US Congress members of Indian origin - who received a classified briefing from the Biden administration on the federal indictment - said that it is critical for India to \"fully investigate [and] hold those responsible, including Indian government officials, accountable, and provide assurances that this will not happen again\".\n\nUS federal prosecutors allege that Gupta had promised $100,000 to an FBI agent posing as a hitman to kill Pannun in New York. Gupta was arrested in the Czech Republic on June 30 at America's request.\n\nOn November 29, US federal prosecutors charged Gupta with murder-for-hire, which carries up to 10 years in prison; and conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, which has a maximum sentence of a 10-year jail term.\n\nThe Indian-American lawmakers also warned of \"significant damage\" to the US-India partnership if New Delhi does not address the situation directly and quickly.\n\nContacted for comments on the delayed approvals for the drone deal, the US State Department said: \"We do not comment on arms sales until we have formally notified [the US] Congress.\"\n\nThe Indian Navy and India's defence ministry also did not respond to a request for comments.\n\n\"India has given its commitment to make a full accounting of the Pannun affair. And then the [Capitol] Hill is going to exercise its judgement on whether India has taken adequate measures or not,\" says the Washington insider.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has played down the impact of this issue on Indo-US ties. In an interview to the Financial Times, Modi said: \"There is strong bipartisan support for the strengthening of this relationship\" and that he didn't think it appropriate \"to link a few incidents with diplomatic relations between the two countries\".\n\nThe Poseidon aircraft and Sea Guardian drones work together, watching over large swathes of the Indian Ocean and will give the Indian Navy an enhanced ability to respond to any attempts to disrupt international trade routes that pass through these waters.\n\nThe versatile Sea Guardian drone has an endurance of over 27 hours, a speed of 240 knots, an operating ceiling of 50,000 feet, and 1,746 kilograms of payload capacity that includes 1,361 kilograms of external stores. The MQ-9A is powered by the Honeywell TPE331-10 turboprop engine, which significantly improves engine performance and fuel efficiency, particularly at low altitudes.\n\nBeing in operational service with the US military, the MQ-9A continues to evolve, keeping it relevant for its customers' emerging needs. The MQ-9A Extended Range (ER) was designed with field-retrofittable capabilities such as wing-borne fuel pods and a new reinforced landing gear that extends the aircraft's already impressive endurance from 27 hours to 34 hours, while further increasing its operational flexibility.- The Wire",

        "title": "Poor reality, poor image",
        "text": "Pakistanis are too busy, worrying about the image of the country and hoping that their preferred leader will fix it all\n\nEvery Pakistani has, at some point or another, expressed his or her frustration with the country's poor image. Millions of Pakistanis work all over the world and have built a reputation for hard work and efficiency.\n\nOverseas Pakistanis are particularly sensitive to adverse comments about anything to do with Pakistan and get upset when their country is portrayed as 'dangerous', 'dysfunctional', or 'unstable' in the international media.\n\nTheir reasoning often is that because they and their friends and family are all decent people, the bad image of Pakistan must solely be the function of the malice of international powers or the malfeasance of Pakistani leaders they dislike. But Pakistan's problem is not just one of image. It is also one of harsh realities.\n\nHow can we expect the world to ignore distressing events that characterise the country's history or the present? After all, historical accounts and media reports are rarely mainly about the niceness, hospitability, or piety of individuals from a country. It is about social and economic indicators, the exercise of power within and outside the country by its rulers and matters of war and peace. Dismissing unflattering analysis as 'anti-state' or 'foreign-inspired' shuts the door for course correction.\n\nDoctors, engineers, and bankers, as well as cab drivers and industrial workers who live and work abroad, have been fed a narrative for years about how their contribution to Pakistan's greatness is squandered by the mistakes of one or another politician. As a result, few have been able to understand that Pakistan's problems and poor image are the product of collective mistakes over a large time span. It is not because of politician A or B but about not having a functioning political system, the absence of a culture of tolerance, and an inability to prioritise economic progress over conflict with others.\n\nPartisan politics blinds people to difficulties with deep roots. Overseas Pakistanis applauded, based on their party sympathies, when Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, Asif Ali Zardari, Yusuf Raza Gilani, and Nawaz Sharif were convicted by Pakistan's courts. Those currently supporting the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) are unhappy that cricket hero Imran Khan has now been convicted and sentenced ahead of a general election. The sad truth is that prime ministers and foreign ministers of countries are their public face to the rest of the world. When they face criminal charges, the country looks bad, and it does not matter to which party they belong.\n\nIt is sometimes difficult to get people to think about issues and their solutions instead of focusing on personalities and which ones among them are to blame. Prosecution, conviction, and sentencing of national leaders should be rare. If almost everyone who rises to high office goes through that process year after year, then there is something wrong with the process and national discourse should focus on that rather than just being restricted to the victimisation of X or Y.\n\nPakistan's political system lacks the crucial elements of compromise and adherence to rule of law that are essential for a workable political system. Constant political conflict, and its repercussions, are a major factor in Pakistan's poor international image, along with the presence of Jihadi militants. Other reasons for Pakistan not being portrayed positively lie in our socio-economic circumstances.\n\nPakistan has come a long way since its creation in 1947 but it lags behind its peers in many ways. This is a harsh reality that needs to be overcome, not just a matter of image. For instance, the literacy rate in Pakistan rose from 11% in 1947 to 58% by 2023. But India's literacy rate rose from 12% to 76.3% over the same period and for a much larger population. Bangladesh took its literacy rate from 17% in 1971 to 74.6% last year.\n\nPakistan's comparatively poorer performance in promoting literacy is not a party-political matter nor can it be blamed solely on the alleged corruption of a set of politicians one dislikes. National pride should not deter Pakistanis from confronting the fact that education has not been their national priority the same way as, say, acquiring nuclear weapons. Pakistan's problem in education is about bad policy priorities, budgetary allocation, and what Pakistanis choose to teach and learn.\n\nPakistan is the fifth largest nation in the world by population, and has the seventh largest army, but is only 24th by size of GDP on PPP basis and 46th in terms of nominal GDP.\n\nFor almost 15 years after independence, Pakistan made no allocation for literacy in its national budget. Between 1947 and 1957, Pakistan's literacy rate actually remained unchanged or declined, albeit marginally. The failure was attributed in official reports to 'unstable administrative and organisational arrangements.' Even now, there are only 15 countries in the world with a lower literacy rate than Pakistan. The low literacy rate and inadequate investment in education have led to a decline in Pakistan's technological base, which in turn hampers economic modernisation.\n\nPakistan's lack of progress in literacy is not because of poverty; Rather, the country's poor economic performance is a result of a lack of higher literacy rates. There are 43 countries in the world that are poorer than Pakistan on a per capita GDP basis but 24 of them send more children to primary school than Pakistan does. But as Pakistan heads into its 12th general election, these and similar harsh realities are hardly discussed in the media or by politicians. Pakistanis are too busy, worrying about the image of the country and hoping that their preferred leader will fix it all.\n\nThe writer, former ambassador of Pakistan to the US, is Diplomat-in-Residence at the Anwar Gargash Diplomatic Academy in Abu Dhabi and Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington DC.",

        "text": "THE Pakistani nation is not only fighting the scourge of terrorism with courage and bravery but also making eternal sacrifices. While the Pakistan Army is fighting a long war against terrorism with dedication and professionalism, India, as an enemy in the neighbourhood of Pakistan, keeps using new tactics to harm it.\n\nOn one hand, India is supporting terrorists, and on the other hand, it is executing targeted killings. Pakistan has presented all evidence of this to the world; now we must see how the world responds. Pakistan has been telling the world for a while that India is behind every act of terrorism, but the world has not responded appropriately. As a result, India is now committing terrorist activities and carrying out targeted killings.\n\nIndia has been involved in illegal activities not only in Pakistan but also in the United States and Canada. India should be held accountable for this terrorism and assassinations at the international level, yet there is no reaction from the world except for harsh statements. India's morale is rising due to the world's hesitant response, and India is starting to realize that it can do whatever it wants in the world. Pakistan is the most targeted country where acts of terrorism and targeted killings are carried out. The Foreign Secretary of Pakistan has shared the details of two such cases with clear evidence in his press briefing, while some other cases are still under investigation. The details that the Foreign Secretary has put before the world, the Inspector General Punjab had also presented some similar details last year and clarified that a nefarious state and its intelligence have been found involved in it. Several incidents of targeted killings have occurred in various parts of the country in recent years, raising suspicions of India's involvement because in the past, various accusations have been made by India against all these victims.\n\nAs the law enforcement agencies have found indisputable evidence of the involvement of Indian agents, it has become necessary to deal with the matter effectively. Along with raising it at the global level, remedial arrangements should be made internally as well because the protection of the country's internal security can be ensured only by redressing this heinous series. At a time when general elections are just around the corner, these changing circumstances call for more effective security measures.\n\nTargeted killing networks operating under the auspices of hostile elements pose a major threat in these circumstances, which, in their own right, are ready to go to any extent for nefarious purposes. The Ministry of Interior has repeatedly expressed serious concerns about this, and it is hoped that the national security institutions will put their concerted efforts to eliminate any loopholes that are being exploited by such activities. Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs will not hesitate to expose India's deceitful face on international forums with all the evidence.\n\nFor a long time, Pakistan has been drawing the attention of the people of the West to Indian terrorism, but the United States and its allies have kept their eyes and ears closed. The United States has also started a formal case against India. It is time for the U.S. and its allies to tighten their grip on India, seeing the evidence of terrorism and targeted killings in Pakistan. Terrorism is behind India's claim of republic; it should not only be declared a terrorist country but should also be blacklisted in FATF or face sanctions. If this is not done, then the raging fire of Indian terrorism will burn the whole world to ashes.\n\n-- The writer is a regular columnist, based in Lahore.",

The Southeast Asian nation has been in turmoil since the February 2021 coup which ended a ten-year experiment with democracy and sparked mass protests and a crackdown on dissent. Three years on, the junta is struggling to crush widespread armed opposition to its rule and recently suffered a series of stunning setbacks to an alliance of ethnic minority armed groups.\n\nActing president U Myint Swe \"announced the extension of the state of emergency for another six months\" at a meeting of the national defence and security council, the junta said in a statement. The extension of the state of emergency -- due to expire at midnight on Wednesday -- was needed to \"continue the process of combatting terrorists,\" the statement added. The council discussed \"preparations for holding multi-party elections\" and the holding of a national census at a meeting in the militarybuilt capital Naypyidaw, it said, without giving details.\n\nThe military declared a state of emergency when it ousted Aung San Suu Kyi's government in February 2021, citing unsubstantiated allegations of electoral fraud in 2020 elections her party won in a landslide. It has extended the state of emergency multiple times since, delaying fresh elections it has promised to hold.\n\nMyanmar's militarydrafted 2008 constitution, which the junta has said is still in force, requires authorities to hold fresh elections within six months of a state of emergency being lifted. A surprise offensive in late October by an alliance of ethnic armed groups in northern Shan state sent the junta reeling. The Arakan Army (AA), Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) seized roads to the country's biggest trading partner China and captured dozens of military outposts. Troops surrendered in their thousands and military units fled into India and China, prompting rare public criticism of the junta leadership by its supporters.",

Millions of Pakistanis work all over the world and have built a reputation for hard work and efficiency.\n\nOverseas Pakistanis are particularly sensitive to adverse comments about anything to do with Pakistan and get upset when their country is portrayed as 'dangerous', 'dysfunctional', or 'unstable' in the international media.\n\nTheir reasoning often is that because they and their friends and family are all decent people, the bad image of Pakistan must solely be the function of the malice of international powers or the malfeasance of Pakistani leaders they dislike. But Pakistan's problem is not just one of image. It is also one of harsh realities.\n\nHow can we expect the world to ignore distressing events that characterize the country's history or the present? After all, historical accounts and media reports are rarely mainly about the niceness, hospitability, or piety of individuals from a country. It is about social and economic indicators, the exercise of power within and outside the country by its rulers and matters of war and peace. Dismissing unflattering analysis as 'anti-state' or 'foreign-inspired' shuts the door for course correction.\n\nDoctors, engineers, and bankers, as well as cab drivers and industrial workers who live and work abroad, have been fed a narrative for years about how their contribution to Pakistan's greatness is squandered by the mistakes of one or another politician. As a result, few have been able to understand that Pakistan's problems and poor image are the product of collective mistakes over a large time span. It is not because of politician A or B but about not having a functioning political system, the absence of a culture of tolerance, and an inability to prioritize economic progress over conflict with others.\n\nPartisan politics blinds people to difficulties with deep roots. Overseas Pakistanis applauded, based on their party sympathies, when Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, Asif Ali Zardari, Yusuf Raza Gilani, and Nawaz Sharif were convicted by Pakistan's courts. Those currently supporting the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) are unhappy that cricket hero Imran Khan has now been convicted and sentenced ahead of a general election. The sad truth is that prime ministers and foreign ministers of countries are their public face to the rest of the world. When they face criminal charges, the country looks bad, and it does not matter to which party they belong.\n\nIt is sometimes difficult to get people to think about issues and their solutions instead of focusing on personalities and which ones among them are to blame. Prosecution, conviction, and sentencing of national leaders should be rare. If almost everyone who rises to high office goes through that process year after year, then there is something wrong with the process and national discourse should focus on that rather than just being restricted to the victimization of X or Y.\n\nPakistan's political system lacks the crucial elements of compromise and adherence to rule of law that are essential for a workable political system. Constant political conflict, and its repercussions, are a major factor in Pakistan's poor international image, along with the presence of Jihadi militants. Other reasons for Pakistan not being portrayed positively lie in our socio-economic circumstances.\n\nPakistan has come a long way since its creation in 1947 but it lags behind its peers in many ways. This is a harsh reality that needs to be overcome, not just a matter of image. For instance, the literacy rate in Pakistan rose from 11 per cent in 1947 to 58 per cent by 2023. But India's literacy rate rose from 12 per cent to 76.3 per cent over the same period and for a much larger population. Bangladesh took its literacy rate from 17 per cent in 1971 to 74.6 per cent last year.\n\nPakistan's comparatively poorer performance in promoting literacy is not a party-political matter nor can it be blamed solely on the alleged corruption of a set of politicians one dislikes. National pride should not deter Pakistanis from confronting the fact that education has not been their national priority the same way as, say, acquiring nuclear weapons. Pakistan's problem in education is about bad policy priorities, budgetary allocation, and what Pakistanis choose to teach and learn.\n\nPakistan is the fifth largest nation in the world by population, and has the seventh largest army, but is only 24th by size of GDP on PPP basis and 46th in terms of nominal GDP.\n\nFor almost fifteen years after independence, Pakistan made no allocation for literacy in its national budget. Between 1947 and 1957, Pakistan's literacy rate actually remained unchanged or declined, albeit marginally. The failure was attributed in official reports to 'unstable administrative and organizational arrangements.' Even now, there are only fifteen countries in the world with a lower literacy rate than Pakistan. The low literacy rate and inadequate investment in education have led to a decline in Pakistan's technological base, which in turn hampers economic modernization.\n\nPakistan's lack of progress in literacy is not because of poverty; Rather, the country's poor economic performance is a result of a lack of higher literacy rates. There are forty-three countries in the world that are poorer than Pakistan on a per capita GDP basis but twenty-four of them send more children to primary school than Pakistan does. But as Pakistan heads into its twelfth general election, these and similar harsh realities are hardly discussed in the media or by politicians. Pakistanis are too busy, worrying about the image of the country and hoping that their preferred leader will fix it all.",

And because adulterated pesticides are produced from insecticides, herbicides and fungicides \"of a lesser commercial value,\" their application can spoil crops, the PRF said.\n\nIncreasingly, criminals are using structures involving front companies that arrange false invoices, produce fake labels, smuggle and move the illegal products.\n\nThe parallel market also represents a human health scare.\n\nFor example, authorities tested batches of seized insecticide Thiamethoxam that showed a 95% concentration of the active ingredient, whereas the highest concentration allowed in Brazil is 50%, the PRF said.\n\nBrazil's only approved Emamectin Benzoate insecticide, used to control larvae and caterpillars, has a 50 gram per kilogram concentration of the active ingredient in its composition. But the same smuggled product can have concentrations ranging from 100 to 300 grams per kilogram, PRF's test data showed.\n\nBrazil imports chemicals used to protect crops from nations, including China and India, accounting for an estimated 20% of global pesticide use.\n\nThe country is a key market for companies like Syngenta, Basf and Bayer.\n\nLast year, the industry welcomed a new law setting harsher penalties for those producing, storing or shipping illegal pesticides in Brazil.\n\nThe new law was signed as seizures of illegal pesticides rose threefold in eight years, to 195.7 tons in 2023, according to PRF data.",

        "title": "Gaza war could shift region's rules of engagement",
        "text": "Operation Al-Aqsa Flood has openly displayed the conflicting interests of stakeholders and brought the region back to the center of attention. Certain observers believe that the outcome of the Gaza dispute will shape the global order, surpassing other current conflicts in Asia or Europe.\n\nAmid the Gaza war and other regional interactions, Iran's tensions with the US and Israel are escalating. Tel Aviv is exploiting the current volatility to target Iranian proxies, particularly Hezbollah. This is part of Israel's greater plan to position itself as the dominant economic and political power in the Middle East by reshaping the region. In light of this, Iran is revamping its strategies and approaches to engage and confront its adversaries.\n\nIran's approach to the Gaza war is based on three key factors. Firstly, its relationship with Hamas and the so-called Axis of Resistance. Secondly, internal socioeconomic conditions, with Iran aiming to address them through de-escalation and reconciliation with its neighbors, as reflected in last year's Saudi Arabia-Iran rapport deal. Thirdly, its relations with the US, amid concerns that, if the war continues and expands, Washington will intervene on the side of Israel, ultimately ending the Iranian project. Iran is keen to avoid this scenario.\n\nIran's perspective, since the outbreak of the Gaza war, is that the US is aiming to reposition itself as a vital actor in the region in the light of China's growing engagement through its transnational corridor, diplomacy and partnerships with Gulf states. Iran posits that, in order to achieve this, Washington and its partners last year announced the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, which Tehran perceives as a threat to its own aspirations to connect East and West, as well as the Global North and Global South, via economic corridors.\n\nSome interpretations suggest that the Oct. 7 attack was an attempt to derail the US project to normalize relations between Israel and the Gulf states. Iran views this project as being dismissive of Palestinian interests and has opposed it since Day 1. Hence, observers argue that Iran, via its proxies - in this case, Hamas - has adopted a more offensive and proactive approach to disrupt the US project, totally altering the understood rules of engagement between the actors.\n\nRegardless of interpretations and which one is more valid than the other, from Israel's perspective, the prime goal of the Gaza war is to eliminate Hamas. If it is successful, Iran will suffer significantly, as it will lose an important lever it has employed in its regional dispute against the US and Israel. In addition, the elimination of Hamas would open the door to more advanced and aggressive campaigns against other Iranian proxies in Syria and Iraq. With the end of these proxies, Iran's influence and role in the region would come to an end.\n\nIran's forward defense strategy is facing a crisis, with Iranian proxies feeling the heat and Tehran believing that the battle could eventually shift to inside its territories. Typically, Iran blamed the US and Israel for this month's Kerman incident, in which almost 100 people were killed and more than 200 injured. Thousands had gathered at the tomb of Qassem Soleimani to mark the fourth anniversary of the former Quds Force commander's killing. In addition, cyberattacks on fuel stations and other critical infrastructure have been showcased by Iran as further evidence of the battle shifting closer to home. Iran is struggling to deal with three key challenges: continual support for its proxies, the consequences of the Gaza war and clear warnings from the US not to expand the conflict. To navigate these challenges, Iran has adopted a strategy that minimizes risks, maximizes gains and considers Arab public opinion.\n\nThrough this, it aims to prevent the Gaza war's ramifications from affecting its domestic stability, avoid direct confrontation with the US or Israel and win the sympathy of the Arab world. For its success, it depends on Iranian proxies sticking to the established rules of engagement. There may be breaches, Iran acknowledges this, and is willing to accept US or Israeli retaliation, even if it is harsh.\n\nThis strategy is shaped by Iran's recognition of its limitations and constraints. It is pursuing a gradual approach of inflicting multiple minor blows on the US and Israel, rather than risking a costly direct confrontation that could risk the Iranian state and its regional ambitions.\n\nThe current conflict between Iranian proxies, Israel and the US has entered a new phase. Many key commanders and masterminds of Iranian proxies, such as Razi Mousavi, Saleh Al-Arouri and Abu Taqwa, have all been assassinated in recent weeks. These assassinations and other attacks were conducted quickly, with short time gaps in between, signifying a shift in the US and Israel's approaches and establishing a new deterrence equation that aims to minimize the chance of broader confrontations, while leaving the door open for US-Iranian dialogue on critical matters.\n\nIn light of this new equation, Iran's responses have been measured, reflecting its limitations. In addition, domestically, the Iranian political currents are divided over whether the country should or should not engage in a multifront regional war. Even Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei issued instructions to commanders, urging them to exercise restraint and avoid direct military confrontation. Russia and China's preoccupations with other war theaters, as well as US efforts to isolate them in the region, could further narrow Iranian options and responses in the future. If the US is successful in pushing back the Russians and Chinese, Iran will be left stranded, with little support, especially if it entangles itself deeper into the Gaza war or works to expand its scope.\n\nThrough analyzing Hassan Nasrallah's statements, it seems Hezbollah and Iran are coordinating to prevent a large-scale confrontation. The limited conflict in Lebanon-Israeli border areas serves as a sign of Hezbollah's willingness to engage in negotiations, particularly concerning border demarcation and issues that have remained unresolved since 2006.\n\nBy analyzing Iran's strategic mindset and reviewing the previous actions taken by Tehran under similar circumstances, it becomes apparent that the conditions for confrontation between it and Israel are currently unfavorable. The qualitative recent Israeli operations have predominantly targeted the support provided by Iran to Hamas via its proxies. These operations are not aimed at directly striking the Iranian project, nor do they target Hezbollah's top leadership or military committees - which are positioned far away from the targeted areas - despite Israel's capability to do so.\n\nThe current situation indicates that the region will undergo significant changes following the Gaza war. The previous balances established in the past decade are no longer in place and the Iranian regime faces an existential threat if it continues to impede the US-Israeli project. Despite this bleak outlook for the regime, it still possesses various levers it could employ to stay afloat. These include closing the Strait of Hormuz and targeting strategic sea routes, with the Red Sea crisis being an example of this. It could also advance its nuclear program to establish a deterrent force against major threats, attack oil tankers to impact global oil prices or expand the scope of the confrontation in the Middle East by targeting Israeli interests both within and outside the Occupied Territories. Another option would be to activate Iranian cells in Europe and worldwide to destabilize global security and stability.\n\nTo conclude, given the Gaza war, its consequences and Iran's adaptation of its approaches and strategies to deal with new challenges, the most likely scenario is for Israel to generalize the model of the 2006 war and its aftermath, such that the cost of the war deters Hamas and other Iranian proxies from attacking it again. However, this Israeli aim is not in contradiction with Iran's overarching ambitions, as its proxies will continue to carry out their operations and roles across the region in line with Tehran's objectives.",

The plot revealed unambiguous communication excerpts between a senior Indian Intelligence operative named as CC-1 in the indictment, an undercover agent of the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), and an Indian middle man Nikhil Gupta to hire a hitman, another US undercover agent, to undertake assassinations. CC-1 through Nikhil Gupta paid $15,000 as advance money of the agreed $100,000 for the murder with an alluring promise to provide more targets for further killings. The murder plot, busted on 29 June 2023 with the arrest of Nikhil Gupta in Prague, also established direct links between the Indian government officials and the assassination of Canadian Citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada in June last year. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had levelled serious allegations in the parliament against the Indian government regarding its involvement in the murder of Nijjar and described the incident as 'violation of its sovereignty'. Ironically, these were not the isolated events, rather they were a sequel to the earlier mysterious killing of a Sikh national, Avtar Singh Khanda, in the UK. However, the British government opted not to raise its concerns due to political reasons.\n\nEarlier, on 25 September 2023, The Washington Post substantiated Prime Minister Trudeau's allegations when it revealed part of the evidence based on eyewitness accounts and CCTV video that indicated execution of a coordinated attack by six gunmen using two vehicles to assassinate Nijjar. The attackers used automated weapons to spray 50 bullets out of which 34 hit the victim. Later, CC-1 also shared footage of Nijjar's killing with the likely hitmen of Gurpatwant Singh Pannun. These stunning revelations and associated communication intercepts added up to irrefutable evidence as to Indian government's culpability in Nijjar's gruesome murder. Imagine if complete range of evidence including direct communication intercepts, record of meetings, details of assets used (vehicles, weapons, ammunition and funds), identification of attackers, abettors and facilitators and their linkage with the Indian authorities were publically revealed, it would not only further humiliate the Indian government but also bring disastrous consequences for the global power ambitions of India.\n\nParadoxically, Indian government responded differently to two similar situations. In Nijjar's case, it appeared that public revelations by Prime Minister Trudeau caught the Indians off guard. Instead of accepting its involvement in the assassination of Nijjar on Canadian soil, Indian government responded with arrogance, launched a diplomatic offensive against Ottawa and outright called the allegations 'absurd'. Shrieking Indian media, in its usual jingoistic chorus, went berserk and even tacitly allowed Professor Kapil Kumar, a renowned Indian scholar and close aide of the Indian Prime Minister, to threaten Canada to be 'nuked' on a national TV channel, without realising that being a NATO member state, Canada is protected by Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty which commits each member state to consider armed attack against one member state to be an armed attack against them all. Ironically, the Indian government also did not issue any clarification or distanced itself from the statement of the Professor.\n\nContrarily, Indian response to similar US allegations was more cautious and somewhat receptive as spokesperson of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, Mr Arindam Bagchi, termed the US allegations 'a matter of concern' and promised thorough investigation. Owing to its vital stakes in India, Washington finds itself in a dilemma to either stand with its NATO allies and protect the Western liberal democratic values or fall prey to its geopolitical compulsions, while inaction is not an option. Nevertheless, despite its so-called geopolitical relevance, India for the first time since 1968 has been compelled to abandon RAW's intelligence operations in Washington DC, San Francisco, Ottawa and London.\n\nIndian government has been unleashing brutal state power to crush political dissent and export terrorism to its neighbouring countries with impunity. In January 2017, Pakistan handed over a dossier to the UN Secretary General along with a confessional statement of Indian spy Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav, a serving naval officer working for RAW, who was travelling on a fake passport with identity of Hussain Mubarak Patel, containing irrefutable evidence and proof of Indian involvement in terrorism inside Pakistan. In August 2022, eight Indian navy officers were arrested in Qatar on charges of espionage and subsequently sentenced to death. However, Western exceptionalism has emboldened New Delhi to expand its state-sponsored terror network to Western countries as well. As a consequence, Sikh nationals in Canada, Australia, Italy, the US and the UK have expressed fear that Indian authorities may crush their political dissent by killing them. According to media reports, Canadian authorities warned Gurmeet Singh Toor, a close associate of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, about threat to his life posed by Indian agents. All of these incidents bear testimony to the fact that Indian state-sponsored terrorism has transcended Indian neighbourhood and has not spared even NATO member states. The situation is too serious to be shrugged off and India cannot get away by merely stating that 'this is contrary to the government policy'.",

Furthermore, the statements shed light on the perceived manipulation of population figures in the census, with APHC leaders viewing this as a deliberate attempt to alter the demographic composition of the territory, potentially diminishing the Kashmiri majority and affecting their political representation.\n\nExpressing concern for imprisoned leaders, youth and activists enduring physical and mental torment in Indian jails, the leaders called on international bodies, including the United Nations, to promptly intervene.\n\nThe statements shed light on the perceived manipulation of population figures in the census, which APHC leaders views as an attempt to turn the Kashmiri majority into a minority. -- KMS",

        "text": "From escalation to de-escala\u00adtion and mutually agreeing to work together to address issues of concern, Iran and Pakistan swiftly covered the entire crisis cycle within a few days. While Ira\u00adnian strikes raised questions about the decision-making mechanism in Tehran and the presence of competing power centers, Pakistan act\u00aded maturely and as a respon\u00adsible state throughout this pe\u00adriod. It signaled that, despite facing several unprecedented internal and external challenges, it is fully capable, ready, and willing to safeguard and, if need be, defend its territorial integri\u00adty and sovereignty.\n\nOn January 16, 2024, Iran target\u00aded what it claimed were Jaish-al-Adil camps in Panjgur, Balochistan, re\u00adsulting in the tragic death of two chil\u00addren. Reacting to this sudden and un\u00adprovoked attack, Islamabad stated that this attack was not only a breach of Pakistan's sovereignty but also an \"egregious violation of internation\u00adal law and the spirit of bilateral rela\u00adtions\" between Pakistan and Iran. It also downgraded its diplomatic rela\u00adtions with Tehran by recalling its am\u00adbassador and expelling the Iranian en\u00advoy in Islamabad. On January 18, 2024, Pakistan in an intelligence-based oper\u00adation, Marg Bar Sarmachar, undertook a series of \"highly coordinated and specifically targeted precision military strikes\" against the Baloch Liberation Front (BLF) and the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) camps at seven locations inside Iran. In an official statement post-operation, it was stated: \"The precision strikes were carried out us\u00ading killer drones, rockets, loitering mu\u00adnitions, and stand-off weapons. Maxi\u00admum care was taken to avoid collateral damage.\" Iranian official sources later confirmed that all dead in these strikes were non-Iranian nationals.\n\nPakistan's reciprocal attack pushed the situation into a stalemate. Now Iran was faced with a dilemma: climb a rung on the escalation ladder and conduct another attack or utilize the peace signal that Islamabad sent and move towards normalization. The fact that Iran accepted that those who were killed in the Pakistani strike were non-Iranian nationals further complicated the situation. However, better sense prevailed, and soon both countries decided to deescalate. According to a joint statement simultaneously issued by Tehran and Islamabad, the foreign ministers of Iran, Hossein Amir Ab\u00addollahian, and Pakistan, Jalil Abbas Jilani, had a telephonic conversation in which they agreed to restore their diplomatic relations and the ambassa\u00addors resumed their duties on 26 Janu\u00adary 2024. Iranian Foreign Minister Ab\u00addollahian would be visiting Pakistan on 29 January 2024.\n\nThe biggest unsolved puzzle is the is\u00adsue of the timing of the Iranian strikes. Just a day before the strikes, Pakistan and Iranian Navies conducted a joint exercise in the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf, and it happened only after a few hours of a meeting between Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar, Pakistan's caretaker prime minister, and Hossein Amir Ab\u00addollahian, the Iranian foreign minister. All this was happening in the backdrop of improved relations between the two countries where a number of projects were identified and implemented and several new were under consideration. The second puzzle is who decided to at\u00adtack and why? A conclusive solution to this puzzle might not be available any time soon. However, in keeping with the fact that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard (IRGC) vowed for revenge after multiple terror attacks coupled with internal political strife, forthcoming national elections, and an urge to dem\u00adonstrate to the USA, the West, and Isra\u00adel of its military capability to conduct such an attack could be identified as possible motivations. The third puzzle is, as per the Iranian strategic analysis, what sort of Pakistani response was anticipated? Pakistan is not a hostile country, and several modes of commu\u00adnication were available to address any such matter. Again, looking at the end, ways and means principle, one cannot make sense of it. India was quick to re\u00adact to the attack and supported the Ira\u00adnian strikes on alleged terror camps in the Pakistani province of Balochistan. The Indian Ministry of External Affairs in a statement declared it an act of self-defense. No such statement or reaction was issued on the other Iranian strikes in Iraq and Syria. How was this to be viewed in Islamabad? The Fourth puz\u00adzle is what was the outcome of a SWOT and/or the cost-benefit analysis be\u00adtween what would be achieved through such an action versus what would be at stake or lost? Although the unneces\u00adsary crisis initiated by Iran with Pak\u00adistan was short-lived and ended posi\u00adtively for both countries yet there are several issues on which all parties would continue to ponder and debate. However, Pakistan throughout this pe\u00adriod acted maturely and as a responsi\u00adble state. One thing that clearly came out of this crisis is that despite the fact that Pakistan is undergoing a compli\u00adcated phase of its history where it is facing several unprecedented internal and external challenges, it is fully capa\u00adble, ready and willing to safeguard and if need be defend its territorial integri\u00adty and sovereignty.\n\nThe most positive point is that both countries demonstrated a desire for ending the hostility and establish peace. This trend should continue and both countries should address issues of concern by working together. To use Oscar Wilde's dictum with a little tem\u00adpering: to attack (Pakistan) once, may be regarded as a misfortune, but to do it again would look like carelessness. What is positive is that both Tehran and Islamabad has decided to tread the path of peacemaking carefully.",

        "text": "Professor Zafar Khan, Head of Dip\u00adlomatic Department of JKLF and a well-known leader of Kashmi\u00adri global diaspora has said, \"Kashmiris are denied their collective and in\u00addividual rights by India. The po\u00adlitical, judicial and security establishment in India has or\u00adchestrated an environment of fear and impunity across Jam\u00admu Kashmir. With thousands of civilian deaths, politically mo\u00adtivated trials of Kashmiri leaders, In\u00addia shows scant respect for domestic and international law. Yasin Malik's tri\u00adal to convert his deeply flawed life sen\u00adtence to death, is a glaring example of this impunity. It has to be said that re\u00adcourse to justice for Kashmiris after an\u00adnexation of disputed Jammu Kashmir, is no longer a basic right for them.\"\n\nHuman Rights Watch in its World Re\u00adport 2023 (India) writes, \"Allegations of torture and extrajudicial killings per\u00adsisted, with the National Human Rights Commission registering 147 deaths in police custody, 1,882 deaths in judicial custody, and 119 alleged extrajudicial killings in the first nine months in 2022.\n\nAmnesty International says, \"Torture and other ill-treatment of detainees in police custody remain widespread.\" According to Amnesty Internation\u00adal, these broadly defined powers fa\u00adcilitate the shooting of the suspects in custody. Amnesty International calls PSA as 'Lawless Law.'\n\nMany members of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Asian Federa\u00adtion Against Involuntary Disappearanc\u00ades, International Commission of Jurists, and other international NGO's have ex\u00adpressed concern that these provisions contravene the right to life provided in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).\n\nDr. Farhan Mujahid Chak, Canadian-Kashmiri scholars and widely respect\u00aded expert on the subject of Kashmir has said, 'The justice system in the disput\u00aded territory of Jammu and Kashmir is as artificial as its current governance structure. No bearing with the reality on the ground and as illegitimate as any settler-colonial power would be any\u00adwhere in the world.' The laws weapon\u00adized in the disputed territory are not meant to protect the powerless against the powerful or establish justice. They operate to perpetuate the illegal stran\u00adglehold India has over society.\n\nAn incarcerated but eminent and in\u00adternationally known human rights ac\u00adtivist, Khurram Parvez echoes those sentiments in 549-pages report on, 'Torture: Indian State's Instrument of Control in Indian Administered Jam\u00admu and Kashmir' on page 104, \"In the context of unprecedented militariza\u00adtion in the state of Jammu and Kash\u00admir post 1989, the army is omnipres\u00adent in all the villages and towns of the Kashmir Valley. Following the Doctrine of Sub-Conventional warfare (breaking the will of the people), the armed forces have perpetrated inter alia massive tor\u00adture in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, they are equipped with legal, political, and moral impunity. Despite possess\u00ading some powers, the judiciary is avoid\u00ading confronting the executive, resulting in an overall state of judicial impunity.\"\n\nUnited States, Department of State Country Report 2022 states that \"The Public Safety Act (PSA), which applies only in Jammu and Kashmir, permits authorities to detain persons without charge or judicial review for up to two years without visitation from family members. In April, the press reported that more than 500 persons remained in detention under the PSA in Jammu and Kashmir.\"\n\nAdvocate Jalil Andrabi has said that \"the laws conferring unrestricted and arbitrary powers on the armed forc\u00ades continue to remain in operation in Jammu & Kashmir, with full impunity to the perpetrators or crimes against the humanity and violations of funda\u00admental human rights, threatening the very existence of the people of Kash\u00admir. Indictments and appeals from the United Nations Rapporteurs on Tor\u00adture; Extrajudicial, summary or arbi\u00adtrary execution; freedom of opinion and expression; situation of human rights defenders; Independence of judges and lawyers; Freedom of reli\u00adgion and belief; Violence against wom\u00aden; International Commission of Ju\u00adrists; Amnesty International; Human Rights Watch have failed to make India to withdraw these laws.\"\n\nThe arbitrary powers conferred upon the armed forces with virtual impunity from any legal action, are a part of de\u00adliberate Indian State policy wherein, ar\u00adbitrary arrest, detention, torture, extra-judicial killing, killings of civilians and unarmed and peaceful demonstrators have been used as a weapon of war. The motive behind these crimes against hu\u00admanity is to force the Kashmiri people to abandon their struggle for fundamental human rights of self-determination.\n\nThe problems associated with at\u00adtempting to curtail human rights abuses in Kashmir are further compli\u00adcated by India's steadfast refusal to al\u00adlow non-governmental organizations, the United Nations Thematic Special Rapporteurs, Amnesty International and other NGO's to investigate allega\u00adtions in Kashmir.\n\nUNHCHR has recommended to the Government of India in its report on page # 48 that \"In line with its stand\u00ading invitation to the Special Proce\u00addures, accept the invitation requests of the almost 20 mandates that have made such requests; in particular, ac\u00adcept the request of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappear\u00adances and facilitate its visit to India, in\u00adcluding to Jammu and Kashmir.\" It has also recommended to the UN Human rights Council to, \"Consider the find\u00adings of this report, including the pos\u00adsible establishment of a commission of inquiry to conduct a comprehensive in\u00addependent international investigation into allegations of human rights viola\u00adtions in Kashmir.\"\n\nIn reality, as Advocate Jalil Andrabi has said the people of Kashmir are pris\u00adoners - prisoners of their conscience. They have been deprived of their non-derogable human rights including their right to life and liberty, and access to justice only because they are demand\u00ading to exercise their fundamental in\u00adalienable and non-derogable right to self-determination. In order to restore the basic human rights of the detainee, it is necessary that India is compelled to concede the right of the people to exer\u00adcise their self-determination and stop its crimes against humanity in Kashmir.\n\nWith these words I have shown the merest tip of the iceberg of the pandem\u00adic violations of human rights with which the people of Kashmir must live on a day-to-day basis. Such events are not rare and occasional, but most decidedly part of a systematic policy of repression, victimization, suppression, and colo\u00adnization. By extension, one has to ask what extremely deleterious effects this activity must have on the psychologi\u00adcal health of even the occupying forces, and on the families and neighbors of all those affected by such violence.\n\nBy virtue of our shared humanity, we are obliged not to sit idly by, but to act swiftly and surely to repair the disas\u00adtrous human chaos that daily threatens human life and human dignity of the peo\u00adple of Kashmir. The question arises: what should be the point of departure for de\u00adtermining a just and lasting basis? The answer obviously is (a) the Charter of the United Nations and (b) the international agreements between India and Pakistan.\n\nDr. Ghulam Nabi Fai\n\nThe writer is the Secretary General of the Washington-based World Kashmir Awareness Forum.

        "title": "From Indian chronicles to human rights violations - Pakistan Observer",
        "text": "PAKISTAN-India conflict has been a long-standing rivalry, with both countries engaging in a continuous battle on the ground and in the realm of narratives. This war of narratives is an integral part of the broader Indo-Pak conflict, as both nations strive to shape international perceptions, domestic opinions and their own self-image. The roots of the Indian war of narratives against Pakistan can be traced back to the partition of British India in 1947, which resulted in the creation of two independent nations, India and Pakistan. India's narrative concerning the partition highlights the violence and suffering inflicted upon innocent civilians, emphasizing the need for peace and reconciliation. The Mumbai attacks of 2008, the Uri attack in 2016 and the Pulwama attack in 2019 have reinforced this narrative, leading India to present itself as a victim of cross-border terrorism.\n\nIndia's nationalist discourse has been shifting towards Hinduism, a departure from secularism and diversity. This shift is promoted by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), aiming to shape the future of Indian society and link it with security policies. Last week, the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated a Hindu temple in Ayodhya, built on the ruins of a historic Mughal-era Babri mosque, which was destroyed by a Hindu mob in 1992.The Indian establishment is using hostile narratives to seek a position in the international system, similar to how regional and rising powers seek identity through identity narratives. However, the potential for India and its hostile identity narratives to make the region unstable is a serious concern, as it may seek open-ended power through these narratives, potentially making the region unstable. This shift in nationalist discourse is a significant concern for the future of India.\n\nPakistan has been targeted by various strategic narratives globally, including being a rogue state involved in nuclear proliferation and hostility towards India. It is also depicted as an irresponsible state harbouring terrorism and sponsoring state terrorism against India. The US manhunt for Osama Bin Laden in Abbottabad led to serious allegations against Pakistan as a state accomplice to terrorists. The narratives also portray Pakistan as a failing state, with questions raised on its nuclear proliferation and security measures. Pakistan maintains a narrative of responsible nuclear states, emphasizing the importance of nuclear deterrence for regional stability while seeking to assure the international community of their commitment to nuclear restraint. Pakistan is also perceived as a state where minority rights are not exercised, with many non-state actors exploiting these rights. The lilting of accused in the name of blasphemy is a new threat Pakistan is facing today. These narratives aim to cast shadows on Pakistan's internal situation and raise concerns about its security measures.\n\nReally though, DisinfoLab, a European NGO, in 2020 discovered a sophisticated misinformation campaign called 'Indian Chronicles' targeting Pakistan since 2005.India's major wire service, ANI, had been leading an operation to spread false news on phoney media platforms. EU DisinfoLab discovered 256 pro-Indian websites in 65 countries linked to the Srivastava Group, an Indian holding firm. The operation has expanded to around 117 nations, focusing on UN and EU members. Ten NGOs with UN Human Rights Council accreditation had been used to attack Pakistan and advance Indian objectives. The campaign also used the names of Harvard Law School professors and a deceased international law expert. A dossier containing proof of India financing terrorism in Pakistan was earlier handed over to the friendly states and the UN by Pakistan.\n\nThe Indian war of narratives against Pakistan has had a substantial impact on bilateral relations, fuelling hostility, mistrust and a lack of dialogue, making it challenging to resolve longstanding disputes such as Kashmir. The heightened rhetoric has also led to several military confrontations, most notably the wars of 1947, 1965, 1971, as well as the Kargil conflict in 1999.Despite the long-standing war of narratives, there are glimmers of hope for reconciliation between India and Pakistan. Several factors indicate that both countries may eventually find a way to resolve their differences. Despite heightened tensions, diplomatic channels between Pakistan and India remain open, serving as crucial tools for communication and conflict resolution. Track-II dialogues, informal discussions involving non-governmental actors, provide a platform for open and candid discussions, fostering trust and generating ideas. Backchannel diplomacy, discreet communication between government officials, can resolve issues or de-escalate tensions when official channels are not working. Public opinion in Pakistan and India varies, with some advocating for a hard-line approach and others advocating for peaceful resolution. Civil society groups, peace activists and individuals promoting dialogue and cooperation can shape public opinion and influence government policies.\n\nInternational actors like the US, China and the UN are urging India and Pakistan to peacefully resolve their differences. However, achieving lasting peace requires transcending adversarial narratives and addressing underlying issues. The complex relationship between the two countries is influenced by historical, political and security factors, necessitating sustained efforts, political will and a willingness to address conflicts.\n\nPakistan has faced numerous conflicts and disputes since 1947, but long-term peace and collaboration have not been achieved due to Indian hypocrisy and deceptions. Third-party mediation has been the most effective method for dispute settlement and the United Nations has made limited contributions to resolving the Kashmir conflict. The lack of an institutional framework and strong distrust between the two nations contributes to the failure of bilateral attempts to resolve disputes. Pakistan and India should work together to promote improved ties through conversation, diplomacy and peaceful dispute resolution. To counter Indian narratives, Pakistan should create a counter narrative and engage in open communication, fact-based information and interpersonal interactions. Civil society, academics and ethical media outlets can dispel myths and advance nuanced viewpoints.\n\n-- The writer is PhD in Political Science and visiting faculty member at QAU Islamabad.",

        "text": "With the release of the highly divisive Bollywood film Fighter, the cinematic landscape is buzzing with a spectrum of opinions. Initial reviews present a nuanced tapestry of critiques, blending disappointment with concerns over the film's handling of sensitive themes.\n\nJournalist Haroon Rashid did not mince words in his assessment of Fighter, as per a TikTok video. He described it as \"one of the most offensive, insulting, disgusting, manipulative pieces of propaganda\" to come out of Bollywood.\n\nHe expressed deep disappointment with the stars involved, emphasising how upset he was with their participation in a project that, according to him, \"distorts facts to such an extent that it puts forward a version of history that didn't happen and instigates hatred amongst communities.\" The BBC reviewer repetitively conveyed his shock at the film's content, deeming it deeply unsettling.\n\nA review by Film Companion provided a critical perspective on Siddharth Anand's directorial choices, likening Fighter to Tom Cruise's Top Gun franchise but deeming it inferior. The film was accused of embodying hyper-masculinity, homoeroticism, and warmongering, with the narrative allegedly lacking the swagger of its inspiration.\n\nThe review noted the film's attempt to distinguish between nationless terrorists and the Pakistani people but criticised the execution, particularly citing off-putting dialogue related to Pakistan. \"The film insists that its battle is with nationless terrorists and not with the Pakistani people, but threats that use phrases like 'India-occupied Pakistan' prove that this distinction is flimsy at best,\" the review highlighted.\n\nThe critic grappled with categorising the film, noting that it cannot be labelled propaganda due to its loose inspiration from real events, and disclaimers declaring it a work of fiction prevent accusations of inaccuracy. Despite being positioned as a tribute, the review questioned the film's entertainment value. The review read, \"You can't call it propaganda because it is loosely inspired by real events. You can't call it inaccurate because the disclaimer says it's a work of fiction. You can't call it mediocre because it's a tribute. You can't call it post-truth because it's Indian. You can't even call it entertaining because war is no laughing matter.\"\n\nThe Guardian's review honed in on technical aspects, criticising the film's excessive use of CGI, particularly in aerial combat scenes. Describing these sequences as \"flat, lifeless, and utterly forgettable,\" the review raised concerns about the film's reliance on visual effects at the expense of storytelling.\n\nThe love story between Hrithik Roshan's cocky squadron leader Patty and Deepika Padukone's fiery fighter pilot Minni was deemed to suffer under the weight of sentimental speeches of patriotic allegiance. The review highlighted the challenges posed by the film's attempt to balance a love story with a patriotic narrative, emphasizing the impact on the overall viewing experience.\n\nThe review stated, \"CGI-ed to death, the much-hyped scenes of aerial combat are flat, lifeless and utterly forgettable. Sentimental speeches of patriotic allegiance weigh down the love story between Roshan's cocky squadron leader Patty and Padukone's fiery fighter pilot Minni.\"\n\nHowever, there were those that liked the film as well. One X user shared, \"Fighter is surprisingly good. The emotion worked for me, the air combat sequences are composed in a way you feel the rush and chaos but are also very easy to follow and, more importantly, the film never forgets to create little moments. The emotional iteration of Hrithik Roshan's 'Please' in the second half, which is such a classic way to create an emotional moment using a callback, is my favourite. Liked it a lot. P.S: Only Siddharth Anand can think of going from a patriotic song to a beach number in the end credits.\"\n\nYet another X user stated, \"I absolutely loved [Hrithik] in Fighter. To give such a fine, nuanced, powerful yet vulnerable performance where his eyes spoke so much, the range of emotions was so palpable. It's not an easy feat to deliver this kind of performance in a hardcore masala entertainer but our man did it so effortlessly. Thank you for being you, for entertaining us, inspiring us. Your consistent great work is evidence of your hard work, discipline and work ethic.\" The fan also claimed that the director \"hit it out of the park again\" with the film.\n\nFighter seems to have sparked controversy and divided opinions in its early reviews, with critics pointing out issues related to narrative choices, portrayal of history, and technical execution. As audiences flock to theatres, the film's success and reception will likely be shaped by how viewers engage with its content and themes.",

        "text": "THE Manchurian Candidate (1962) starring Frank Sinatra, Janet Leigh and Angela Lansbury -- of Murder She Wrote fame -- was one of the most iconic films of the Cold War era. Building on anti-communist paranoia, the story centres on Captain Shaw, a scion of a prominent political family, who is captured and brainwashed by communists during the Korean War. Shaw's mother, the real puppet master, plans to use Shaw to carry out the assassination of the leading candidate in the elections so that communists can get their candidate -- Manchurian candidate -- to the White House with \"...powers that will make martial law seem like anarchy\".\n\nThough there was a remake of the film in 2004, its main message was buried by the sands of time. But, as more than half of the world's population votes this year, the film's themes centred on the fraught nature of democracy -- political conspiracies, special interest and violence -- remain as relevant today as during the height of the Cold War.\n\n2024 is truly the 'year of democracy' as more than four billion people -- including from Brazil, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the US and UK comprising eight out of the 10 most populous nations -- in over 70 countries will vote in elections. But, where this milestone should be celebrated, democracy appears to be in serious trouble.\n\nFor starters, the quality of democracy is plummeting almost everywhere. Most democracies are now suffering from democratic backsliding or a 'democratic recession', a term coined by Larry Diamond, a Stanford University professor.\n\nMost democracies are now suffering from a 'democratic recession'.\n\nAccording to the latest Democracy Report by the V-dem Institute, advances made in democracy over the last 35 years have been wiped out and the level of democracy enjoyed by the average global citizen is down to 1986 levels. Specifically, drastic negative changes are taking place in freedom of expression, government censorship of media, government repression of civil society and in the quality of elections -- many of which will have no meaningful policy impact.\n\nIn order to understand how we got here we are going to have to take a historical detour. Charles Tilly, an American academic, explained that the need to pay for pre-modern war forced state formation; a mechanism largely for extraction -- conscription and taxation. In societies where capitalism was already entrenched, capitalists and merchants entered into a marriage of convenience with the state by enshrining democracy. They did so to protect their economic gains from state predation as democracy offered the best protection by allowing the people a say in the formation of extractive policies.\n\nIn unequal societies, however, the marriage of convenience between capitalism and democracy was not a marriage of equals; it remained tilted in favour of capitalism. Thomas Piketty pointed out how in the case of Sweden, money could literally buy political influence, albeit with some restrictions. But, once capitalism was no longer in the ring against another economic system in the post-Soviet era, capitalist elites, apparently, activated populists -- or modern-day Manchurian candidates -- for capturing democracy, the very system that had earlier generated protection for them, so as to close the door on redistributive taxation, forever.\n\nAt least in the case of the US, the best example of capitalism's encirclement of democracy is evident in 'Citizens United vs Federal Election Commission' (2010), a controversial decision from the US supreme court that reversed century-old campaign finance restrictions enabling corporations and other groups to spend unlimited funds on elections.\n\nWhere government policies are increasingly being influenced by special interests impacting democracy's quality, the global economic growth engine is also stalling. According to the World Bank, the global economy is poised for its weakest half-decade growth in 30 years. But, instead of placing capitalism on the chopping block, populists have turned the heat on democracy by claiming that it provides a disproportionate share of the economic pie to immigrants and minorities.\n\nThis cat-and-mouse game between capitalism and democracy will be played out in many countries this year. However, none of these elections have the potential to subvert democracy like in the US, where Donald Trump will likely be pitted against President Joe Biden, an unpopular and ageing candidate.\n\nOnce back in the White House, analysts argue, Donald Trump may weaponise the US Justice Department to go against political opponents. Civil rights, religious freedom as well as freedom of speech could all come under strain as Trump's legal supporters are already developing procedural rationales like the unitary executive theory that may assist in bypassing various checks and balances in the US political system.\n\nGiven Trump's protectionist ideas, Trump's second term could prove disastrous for economic growth, especially if he decides to slap import tariffs on China and Europe. Additionally, if Trump's foreign policy pronouncements are to be believed, the US could withdraw from Nato, leaving the field open for other hegemons. Indeed, some have likened Trump to a modern-day Manchurian candidate given his apparent paranoia of US intelligence agencies, while exhibiting trust in foreign governments.\n\nIn India, where the BJP's win in the 2024 elections is \"almost an inevitability\", Narendra Modi, another populist, has been capitalising on economic insecurities in the run-up to elections. Despite a high economic growth, the Indian economy has failed to create enough jobs -- the unemployment rate has exceeded 10 per cent for the first time since the pandemic. Ramachandra Guha, an Indian historian, believes that if left unchallenged, the Modi regime \"may come to be remembered ... for its dismantling of Indian democracy\".\n\nDemocracy is increasingly appearing weak in the age of unbridled capitalism and populism. Will capitalism finally win by delivering a coup de gr\u00e2ce? The short answer is that all is not lost, at least not yet. Where the relationship between capitalism and democracy has evolved, with the former coming to dominate the latter, capitalism, too, will also face evolutionary pressure to settle on a new equilibrium with people power. Of course, this idea is based on a hope and a prayer that the voting publics will identify the populists for the Manchurian candidates that they really are.",

        "text": "The recent consecration of the Ayodhya temple on the ruins of a historic Mughal-era Mosque is a blatant erasure of Muslim heritage and identity. The temple has been built on grounds where the Babri mosque, named after Mu\u00adghal emperor Babar, stood for centuries be\u00adfore it was torn down in 1992 by a Hindu mob. The destruction of the 16th-century mosque sparked the most severe religious riots since independence, resulting in the deaths of over 2,000 people, predominant\u00adly Muslims and forever denting the so-called secular political order India claimed.\n\nAddressing the crowd outside the temple, Nar\u00adendra Modi declared that January 22, 2024, signi\u00adfies more than just a date on the calendar; it marks the beginning of a new era. The era he alludes to is that of Hindutva/saffron terror. The decision to build the Ayodhya temple at this contentious lo\u00adcation, a longstanding source of religious fissures, shows a brazen disregard for the rich Muslim histo\u00adry associated with the site and further marginalizes the Muslim minority. This development serves as a strategic move for Mr. Modi, effectively kickstarting his campaign for re-election in the upcoming 2024 national polls. The unveiling of the temple is not just that, but it is the launch of Modi's Hindutva ide\u00adology where he seeks to relegate Muslims, approx\u00adimately 14% of Indians, to a secondary status and majoritarian violence. In the recent years under the BJP rule, there have been disturbingly common re\u00adports of terrorizing Indian Muslims as India gradu\u00adally becomes an electoral autocracy marking a sig\u00adnificant decline in human and civil rights.\n\nModi's Hindu nationalist BJP and its affiliates have portrayed the inauguration of the temple as a symbolic liberation from the historical centuries of dominance by Muslim invaders and colonial powers. Just last year, education officials in India purged crucial passages concerning Muslim rule during the Mughal empire from textbooks. The re\u00adcently released textbooks, unveiled in early April 2023, have removed sections that previously cov\u00adered significant periods of the Mughal empire, the 2002 Gujarat riots -- during which hundreds of Muslims lost their lives while current Prime Min\u00adister Narendra Modi served as the chief minister -- and the assassination of Mohandas K. Gandhi, who was targeted by a Hindu extremist. In tandem, city names with Muslim or Mughal origins have been changed while hyper nationalist Bollywood films are being made to stoke unnecessary hate to\u00adwards Pakistan and Muslims. All these deliberate attempts aimed at the erasure of Muslim heritage have been carefully curated to craft a Hindu na\u00adtionalist narrative for the country.\n\nThe rebranding of India into Hindu-first nation under the BJP rule has escalated anti-Muslim hate speech and gave rise to an alarming increase in Hindu lynch mobs that have killed Muslims on mere suspicion of slaughtering or even transport\u00ading cows, deemed sacred by Hindus. These devel\u00adopments warn of an impending genocide.\n\nMr. Modi would do well to remember that the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru de\u00adlivered his first speech post-independence at the Red Fort, built under Mughal Emperor Shah Jah\u00adan's rule. While India moves towards a regressive autocracy, these measures represent a crippling embrace of ignorance about one's own origin.\n\nIt is critical that in the upcoming elections sched\u00aduled later this year, the Indian citizenry must stand for social justice, and against the rising right-wing forces of fascism and authoritarianism.",

        "text": "In a horrifying and reprehensible act, nine Pakistani workers were killed in Iran's Sistan-Balochistan province. The tragic event unfolded in the early hours of the morning when unidentified assailants attacked the sleeping Pakistani workers, leaving them with multiple bullet injuries, leading to their demise.\n\nThe incident occurred just a day after the official resumption of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Iran following a brief strain in bilateral relations that witnessed Iran's surprising attack inside Pakistan, prompting a measured response from Pakistan against terrorist hideouts in Sistan-Balochistan. This heinous act strikes at the heart of the recent efforts made by both nations to foster a more cooperative relationship. Such attacks not only claim innocent lives but also pose a significant threat to regional stability. It is essential to condemn this act in the strongest terms, expressing solidarity with the victims' families and emphasizing the need for joint efforts to eliminate the forces behind such violence. Those who seek to disrupt normal and cordial relations between Pakistan and Iran are undoubtedly behind this despicable incident.\n\nAs both nations strive to overcome recent cross-border tensions, it is evident that there are elements keen on sowing seeds of hostility. Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani very rightly identified the attack as an attempt to sabotage Pak-Iran ties. This should not be allowed to happen under any circumstances. India has the history of carrying out extra-territorial killings. A few days ago, our Foreign Secretary shared details of India's involvement in the killing of two Pakistanis. Not only this, India has also been caught red-handed in the killing of a Sikh leader in Canada, while it was also found involved in plotting the assassination of another Sikh leader in the US. The involvement of the Indian intelligence agency RAW in the killing of Pakistanis in Sistan-Balochistan cannot be ruled out. It is for the Iranian side to swiftly and comprehensively investigate the incident, apprehend those behind it and also share the findings of the investigation with Pakistan.\n\nThe latest attack necessitates that both countries collaborate and counter the threat posed by foreign-backed terrorists. The visit of Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian to Pakistan provides an opportunity to address the matter at the diplomatic level, fostering a joint commitment to counter-terrorism. The two sides must strengthen intelligence sharing and enhance security cooperation to foil the nefarious designs of the enemies.",

The disturbing footage depicts Khan raining blows on the victim with a slipper and dragging him by the hair.\n\nBritish Asian Trust said: \"We take all accusations of abuse seriously and we will look into this urgently.\"\n\nThe 49-year-old global music star, who has admitted to the assault, has a significant social media following of eight million and has met King Charles on multiple occasions in his capacity as an ambassador for the charity.\n\nIn a series of three videos, Khan is seen arguing with the victim, demanding the whereabouts of his bottle and threatening violence.

The incident gained widespread attention after a video surfaced on social media platforms capturing Hindutva terrorists placing the flags atop the church amidst chants of \"Jai Shri Ram.\"\n\nWhile a Muslim youth, Mehdi Hasan, was brutally attacked and killed in the Uttar Pradesh city of Noida on the same day.\n\nThese incidents underscore the pressing need for authorities and society to address rising religious intolerance, discrimination, and violence, reaffirming the values of religious acceptance and communal harmony.",

        "text": "BENGALURU: The Indonesian rupiah was headed for its biggest weekly slide in a year on Friday as reports of the potential resignation of the country's finance minister dampened investor sentiment.\n\nThe rupiah, which had been already under pressure amid political uncertainty ahead of the Feb. 14 presidential election, is on track for its fourth week of losses. It is down 1.3% so far for the week.\n\nReports that Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati could quit have weighed on the currency further and was seen as a factor prompting central bank intervention in the market earlier this week.\n\n\"Markets did not take too kindly to rumours of Finance Minister Sri Mulyani's impending exit, since Indonesia's fiscal prudence in recent years was credited to her astute stewardship of public finances,\" said Nicholas Chia, macro strategist at Standard Chartered in Singapore.\n\nPolitical uncertainty will continue to drag the rupiah lower given the \"long lull between the first round of the presidential elections in February, a plausible run-off in June and the inauguration of the winner in October,\" Chia added.\n\nThe rupiah was flat in afternoon trade, near a three-month low touched on Thursday. Indonesian stocks were down nearly 1% and were headed for a 1.6% fall for the week.\n\nOther Southeast Asian currencies were largely rangebound. The Philippine peso led gains, rising 0.3%, and Thailand's baht was 0.2% higher. Both, however, were set to log their fourth straight weekly loss.\n\nThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, eked out gains of 0.3% as investors assessed the surprisingly strong US GDP data and its potential impact on the Federal Reserve's stance on monetary policy when it meets next week.\n\nOn investors' radar is also a key US inflation reading, due later in the day.\n\nAmong Asian stocks, shares in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur rose 0.4% and 0.3%, respectively. Those in Taipei and Manila were largely unchanged.\n\nThe support measures to help ailing markets in China, the region's top trading partner, provided Southeast Asian equities a breather, with stocks in Shanghai reversing early losses to add over 0.5%.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.4%. The index, however, was on track for a weekly gain of 1.6%.\n\nIndian markets were closed for a public holiday.\n\nNext week, investor focus will be on the Monetary Authority of Singapore's January policy statement, India's interim budget and the Philippines' fourth-quarter GDP.",

        "text": "LUCKNOW: Indians queuing in long lines for jobs in Israel as the war on the Gaza Strip grinds on say the risks to their safety are preferable to hunger at home.\n\nRecruiters are aiming to fill a labour shortage in Israel exacerbated by nearly four months of fighting against Palestinian militants in Gaza.\n\nWhile India is the world's fifth-largest economy and one of the fastest growing, it has struggled to produce enough full-time and well-paying jobs for millions of people.\n\nFor the hundreds of Indians in line, almost all men, the chance of a skilled construction job in Israel -- and wages up to 18 times higher -- outweighs their fears.\n\nMany workers say risks to their safety are preferable to hunger at home\n\n\"If it is written in our fate to die, we'll die there -- at least our kids will get something,\" said motorbike mechanic Jabbar Singh, among the packed crowd at a training centre and recruitment site in Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh state. \"It's better than hunger here.\"\n\nIndia's urban unemployment rate -- the percentage of people wanting work who cannot find a job -- dipped to 5.1 per cent in July 2022-June 2023, from 6.6pc between the same months a year earlier.\n\nOver the same period, nearly 22pc of India's workforce was classified as \"casual labour\", with average monthly wages a paltry 7,899 Indian rupees ($95), according to government figures.\n\nIndian tile designer Deepak Kumar said it was a matter of \"work for four days, eat for two days\".\n\nMr Kumar said he followed the news and knew the risks, but wanted to find work for the sake of his children. \"I will smile and take a bullet -- but will take 150,000 rupees ($1,800)\", he said.\n\n'10,000 families will be fed'\n\nIndians working in Israel is a well-trodden path. The Indian embassy in Tel Aviv says there are about 18,000 Indian citizens in Israel, \"primarily caregivers\" looking after the elderly, as well as others employed as diamond traders and IT professionals. Some are students.\n\nBut recruiters have launched a fresh drive for job seekers.\n\nRaj Kumar Yadav, head of Lucknow's Industrial Training Institute, said they were facilitating recruiters from Israel looking for 10,000 skilled construction workers who could earn as much as $1,685 a month.\n\n\"They will give them the visa and take the people with them on a chartered plane,\" he said, adding that \"10,000 families will be fed well and will grow.\"\n\nThe programme is supported by the authorities in both nations, he said.\n\nIndia's foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal told reporters last week there were long-existing employment agreements between the countries.\n\n\"We already have a large number of people, especially in the caregiving sector in Israel,\" Mr Jaiswal said, adding that the agreement helped to ensure \"regulated migration\".\n\nMeanwhile, many foreign workers fled Israel after the Oct 7 attack, stripping the farm sector of a key source of labour. Israel has also withdrawn 130,000 work permits from Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Indian workers provide one way to fill the gap.\n\nFather of two Keshav Das said he felt he had no choice. \"There is no work here, so I will have to work somewhere,\" Mr Das said. \"I know I am going in the red zone. But I have to feed my family, so I will have to go out. Otherwise, my kids will die hungry.\"",

        "text": "THE year 2024 could not have started on a worse note. First, a humanitarian catastrophe of genocidal proportions has been unfolding in Gaza for over three months, owing to daily attacks by Israel's defence forces. The Houthis are attacking merchant ships in the Red Sea, obliging the US and other countries to mobilise their navies. Israeli attacks on Lebanon and Syria carry the risk of the conflict engulfing the entire region.\n\nSecond, the war in Ukraine has devastated the country, once known for its fertile land and grain exports. Millions of Ukrainians have been displaced, with little access to food, water or electricity. Russia, too, has suffered losses, but remains determined to fight on despite economic sanctions and Nato's continued expansion eastward. Finland's inclusion as its 31st member has more than doubled the length of Nato's borders with Russia. Sweden, too, is gearing up to join. The war's end is not in sight.\n\nThird, the US-China strategic competition is intensifying, deepening risk and uncertainty in a world already in disorder. The two countries remain locked in a technology war, with growing rivalry over AI supremacy and the manufacture of advanced semiconductor chips that power AI technologies. The US, which has an edge in semiconductors supply chains, is building up additional pressure on China through export controls and investment curbs. For its part, China retains dominance in supply chains for minerals, particularly cobalt and lithium used for manufacturing EVs, batteries and solar panels. To neutralise these advantages, the US has imposed a high tariff on Chinese cars and other products. The rivalry has created alarm that the world is headed towards camp politics.\n\nFourth, the international security environment has been vitiated. Major powers are modernising their nuclear arsenals as arms control regimes give way to a nuclear arms race. In November, Russia de-ratified the CTBT, opening the door for further nuclear testing. The Iran nuclear deal remains in a state of stalemate. The US-Russia agreement, New START, which limits the number of deployed strategic nuclear warheads, was suspended by Russia in 2023. The INF treaty, which sought elimination of intermediate-range nuclear forces deemed essential for European security, was terminated by the US in 2019.\n\nFor Pakistan, 2024 is a watershed year.\n\nIn the midst of all this, dozens of countries are heading towards elections in 2024. Anxiety surrounds the forthcoming presidential election in the US. Joe Biden, 81, and Donald Trump, 77, are up for a contest the outcome of which would have profound implications for geopolitics, particularly the transatlantic equation. Russian President Vladimir Putin is seeking a fifth term in March. Indonesia and India are going to polls in February and May respectively. The UK will hold elections in the second half of the year. Acrimonious and populist rhetoric is sharpening societal polarisation in countries undergoing electoral transitions. The world economy has picked up pace, and the business use of generative AI has grown manifold. But most developing countries continue to suffer low growth, high inflation and unemployment challenges.\n\nFor Pakistan, 2024 is a watershed moment. For years, it has remained in the grip of political instability, economic uncertainty and rising terrorism. The pre-election environment is toxic. The blame game is at its peak. Investors are worried about Pakistan's economic future. The balance-of-payment crisis is not resolved. In this background, the Feb 8 polls are crucial. Pakistan needs a sustained period of political stability, which would ensure continuity in econo\u00admic policies and help restore growth and industrial development.\n\nIn foreign policy, the next elected government has to manage ties with China and the US, despite their growing rivalry. One piece of good news is that the economies of both countries are so inter-dependent that the decoupling from China's economy the US had earlier envisaged is not happening. That opens up possibilities for Pakistan to maintain ties with both China and the US. In an age of rising unilateralism and declining multilateralism, countries like Pakistan need to engage in multi-alignments to promote their political, economic and security interests. Pakistan also needs to stabilise its frontiers with Afghanistan and Iran, shifting the focus to economic cooperation.\n\nThe trajectory of Pakistan's ties with India will be determined by the outcome of India's elections. With the scare created in India against Muslim icons, especially historical mosques, and the tendency of Indian intelligence to target opponents on foreign soil -- Canada, the US, and now Pakistan -- the new government will need much effort and smart diplomacy to restore normal ties with India.",

They have since declared US and Brit\u00adish interests to be legitimate targets as well.

        "text": "BEIJING, Jan 27 (APP): India's support for terrorism and continuous masterminding and implementation of overseas assassinations with terrorist organizations is one of the main reasons for proliferation of international terrorism and its impact on global peace and stability, Cheng Xizhong, Visiting Professor at Southwest University of Political Science and Law said on Saturday.\n\nThe international community should strongly condemn India's acts of state terrorism, firmly prevent India from using the \"proxy war\" to disrupt the social stability and economic development of neighboring countries, he said in a statement.\n\nProf Cheng noticed that after Pakistani Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi fully exposed the involvement of Indian agents in two assassinations in Pakistan and India's years of hiring, financing and supporting terrorists in Pakistan, based on irrefutable evidences, at a press conference on January 25, the international media has conducted extensive coverage, which has aroused strong indignation among people across the world towards the Indian state terrorism.\n\nHe pointed out that due to India's beggar-thy-neighbor policies, neighboring countries now have become victims of Indian state terrorism. India's \"proxy war\" and support for terrorism in neighboring countries seriously infringe on their sovereignty and violate the United Nations Charter, which is completely unacceptable.\n\nTerrorism is the common enemy for human kind. China firmly opposes double standards on counter-terrorism and stands\n\nready to step up cooperation with other countries and jointly combat all forms of terrorism, he concluded.",

These allegations have raised concerns about sovereignty, international law, and the safety of political dissidents globally.\n\nThe indictments brought against one Nikhil Gupta over attempt to kill Mr Pannun revealed that it had links to Mr Nijjar's killing. Mr Gupta had been working under the instructions of an Indian official.\n\nFollowing Canada's allegations regarding Mr Nijjar's killing, the United States, which had supplied Canada with crucial intelligence on the incident, formally called on Delhi to collaborate with Ottawa in conducting thorough investigations.\n\nIndia's intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing, has long been implicated in executing terrorist activities in Pakistan. Lately, it was suspected of utilising criminal groups and operatives stationed in the United Arab Emirates for carrying out assassinations of Sikh and Kashmiri separatists in Pakistan.\n\nA noticeable acceleration in these occurrences was witnessed last year.\n\nIslamabad is investigating around 10 such cases, but in two cases -- the assassination of Muhammad Riaz in Rawalakot last September and Shahid Latif in Sialkot the previous October, Indian involvement has been conclusively established, the diplomat asserted.\n\nBoth victims are believed to have had links with the uprising in India-held Kashmir.\n\n\"We have credible evidence of links between Indian agents and assassination of two Pakistani nationals on Pakistani soil,\" Foreign Secretary Syrus Sajjad Qazi said at a media briefing earlier this week.

The Kulbhushan Jadhav case is perhaps the most famous of these instances, but there have been other such incidents.\n\nOn Thursday, Foreign Secretary Syrus Qazi told a press conference that the state had credible evidence of Indian involvement in extrajudicial killings in Pakistan. He specifically mentioned the murders last year of Mohammad Riaz in Rawalakot, Azad Kashmir, and Shahid Latif in Sialkot.\n\nThere had long been speculation that the two men -- formerly associated with Kashmir-centric militant outfits -- may have been targeted by the Indians, and Mr Qazi's briefing confirmed these suspicions. He also named the local suspects held for their involvement in the killings, while identifying by name Indian agents believed to have overseen these operations.\n\nOne of the Indian operatives was reportedly operating from a Gulf country. While New Delhi has been quick to denounce these claims, as the foreign secretary pointed out, some Indian mainstream and social media accounts had initially boasted about the killings as 'retribution'.\n\nFirstly, no foreign actor can be allowed to violate Pakistan's territorial sovereignty by carrying out such illegal killings. If any state believes individuals in Pakistan have been involved in wrongdoing, diplomatic channels need to be used to resolve the issue. Gung-ho actions seemingly out of spy thrillers cannot be tolerated.\n\nSecondly, the administration needs to be vigilant so that malign forces working for hostile states are not able to take the law into their own hands, and murder people at will on our soil.\n\nWhile India may reply in sanctimonious terms to Pakistan's claims of involvement in cross-border assassinations, it will be unable to respond in similar fashion to Western states, such as the US, where an Indian citizen has been charged in a failed plot to kill a pro-Khalistan activist.\n\nIndia must respect the rules of engagement and desist from destabilising other states, while its Western friends need to be more vocal about the former's illegal activities on foreign soil as this is not how responsible states behave.",

However, the lack of rains and snow falls this year in win\u00adter signified the country's water vulnerability that may create food security challenges besides energy crisis in years ahead if we do not construct run of the river dams being cost and time efficient\", said Tauheedul Haq, former Conservator of Forests while talking to APP.\n\nReferring to the National Wa\u00adter Policy 2018, he said that per capita surface water avail\u00adability has declined from 5,260 cubic meter per annum in 1951 to a significant 1000 cubic me\u00adters in 2016 and feared that this quantity would likely to further decrease by about 860 cubic meter in next few years if deforestation and population bulge continued and water of rivers were not stored through better water management.\n\nWith glaciers retreat, he said more glacial lakes would be formed especially in Chitral and Swat besides Gilgit-Baltistan with high chances of Glacial Lake Out\u00adburst Floods (GOLF) as evident at Attabad lake GOLF that neces\u00adsitated more runner of the river dams in Rivers Swat, Kunhar at Kaghan, Naran and Punjokora Dir Upper that are most suited for these kinds of hydel projects besides averting flash floods.\n\nDr Professor Zilakat Malik, former Chairman Economics Department, University of Pe\u00adshawar said that climate change, 240.954 million population bulge and technological advance\u00adment started exerting pressure on energy resources in the coun\u00adtry that was already facing about 7,000 megawatts (MW) shortfall affecting GDP growth.\n\nHe said the promotion of run-of-the-river (ROR) hydroelectric\u00adity would be required to bridge the widening demand-supply gap of electricity besides fulfilling the pressing demands of afford\u00adable energy of the consumers in\u00adcreasing with each passing day in the wake of mushroom growth of IT and agriculture sectors.\n\nHe said that the energy con\u00adsumption share of industries has increased by 28 percent during July-April 2022 from 26.3 per\u00adcent recorded in July-April 2021 while the share of the agriculture sector jacked up to nine percent from 8.9 percent during the same period. The 2022 devastating floods have adversely affected the country's agriculture, econo\u00admy, livestock, and energy sectors as scores of mini micro-hydel stations were swept away by the gushing water that inflicted over USD 40 billion in economic losses to the government kitty.\n\n\"We need to adopt the culture of construction of small water reservoirs and ROR projects be\u00ading cost and time-efficient and is very popular in developed countries to avert water crisis\", he said. Dr Zilakat Malik said China had constructed about 98,000 dams, India 5,324 dams and only 150 dams by Pakistan. He said despite the huge 30,000 MW hydel potential of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, not a single dam was constructed in Pakistan af\u00adter the Tarbela dam was built on River Indus in 1984 with an es\u00adtimated cost of USD1.49 billion.\n\nCiting examples of ROR dams in the world, he said that Cana\u00adda is generating about USD 140 million annual revenues from Niagara ROR dams attracting over one million tourists every year. Similarly, Hoover RoR dam on the Colorado River generates about USD 250 annual revenue for the USA and the Three Gorg\u00ades ROR Dam on Yangtze River contributed USD 1.5 billion in tourism revenue in 2019 to the economy of China.\n\nEngr Zahoor Hussain, Direc\u00adtor of Projects Wapda said that ROR hydroelectricity is a type of hydroelectric generation plant whereby little or no wa\u00adter storage is provided for elec\u00adtricity generation.\n\nHe said ROR hydroelectricity was considered ideal for rivers and streams that could sustain a minimum flow or those regulated by a lake or reservoir upstream. He said a small dam was usually built to create a head pond en\u00adsuring that there is enough water entering the penstock pipes that lead to the turbines which are at lower elevations.\n\nEngr Zahoor said ROR was a prime source of renewable energy that does not produce greenhouse gases and can eas\u00adily be located in remote areas where other forms of energy generation were not feasible be\u00adsides these could be built quick\u00adly and required less investment than conventional dams.\n\nHe said Chitral, Kohistan, Up\u00adper Mansehra, Dir, and Swat in KP, Northern Punjab, Azad Kash\u00admir, and Gilgit Baltistan (GB) rivers were most suited for ROR dams. He said the Grand Coulee dam at Washington USA and the Itaipu dam on River Parana be\u00adtween Brazil and Paraguay were the world's largest ROR projects that generate electricity from the natural flow of the rivers.\n\nEngr Zahoor said that the con\u00adstruction of ROR hydroelectric\u00adity projects in these areas would help provide clean, renewable, and affordable energy to the local population that could be a valu\u00adable addition to the national grid. However, ROR dams can harm the environment and ecology such as disrupting fish migra\u00adtion and altering water quality. Engineer Muhammad Luqman Khan, Chief Planning Officer, of KP Energy Department, said that under the power generation policy 2015, an inclusive strat\u00adegy has been adopted for pro\u00admoting the culture of ROR dams in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Under the strategy, he said the focus was being made on awareness campaigns for educating people about the significance of ROR dams and their role in clean en\u00adergy generation, water resource management, and economic de\u00advelopment. He said ROR could be achieved by offering finan\u00adcial incentives, tax breaks, and a speedy approval process under public partnership mode. \"Faster collaboration with international organizations and countries that have experience in ROR projects was a key area of the government strategy to promote such culture in the country and especially in the province for socio-economic development of people besides averting the looming water cri\u00adsis\", he concluded.",

Similar rallies, often to the beat of booming far-right pop music, took place outside mosques and Muslim neighbourhoods across several states in India.\n\nThe trigger was the consecration of a Ram temple in the ancient city of Ayodhya in northern India by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday. The temple is being built on the site where the 16th century Babri Masjid stood until 1992, when Hindu far-right mobs tore down the mosque, triggering nationwide riots that killed more than 2,000 people, mostly Muslims.\n\nAddressing the country from Ayodhya, Modi said that the \"wheel of time\" had turned, rejecting criticism over the increased religious tensions that have been simmering in India since he came to power in 2014. \"Ram is not a problem but a solution,\" he said. \"We are laying the foundation of India for the next 1,000 years. We take a pledge to build a capable, grand, divine India from this moment.\"\n\nYet, as India celebrates its Republic Day on January 26, the inauguration of the temple, the Indian state's role in it, and the violence and vandalism that religious minorities have faced since then are, to many, markers of a country that has moved away from the Constitution adopted this day in 1950.\n\nSoon after the consecration, a Muslim graveyard was set ablaze in the north Indian state of Bihar, a Muslim man was paraded naked in southern India, and a saffron flag representing militant Hinduism - was hoisted atop a church in central India.\n\n\"This country is increasingly unrecognisable to me, where Muslims are like rubbish for them,\" said Haque, on his way to a police station with his son after the Tuesday attack. \"There were so many people [during the Mira Road attack] but no one stopped them from beating my child. It is shameful for society. It is a city of the blind.\"\n\n'High priest of Hinduism'\n\nThe national broadcast of the temple inauguration, including the unveiling of the idol of Ram, brought India to a halt on Monday morning. Large LED screens were set up in villages, and people gathered at temples with their families to watch the ceremony live.\n\nPolarising speeches by Modi and his colleagues were broadcast in cinema theatres and on YouTube. Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay, an author and Modi's biographer, noted that the event cast the prime minister as \"the high priest of Hinduism\".\n\n\"This is the origin of a new time cycle,\" Modi said. \"A nation rising after breaking the mentality of slavery ... a thousand years from now, people will talk about this date, this moment. The Ram temple's construction reflects Indian society's maturity.\"\n\nThe union cabinet adopted a resolution to applaud the opening of the temple, stating that the country had \"independence in 1947, but its soul was freed from centuries of colonial enslavement\" on January 22.\n\nHowever, his critics say that the event was political, rather than a religious one. \"It was more about Modi than Ram - a total instrumentalisation of Ram's figure to serve the cause of an elected monarch,\" said Apoorvanand, a professor at the University of Delhi.\n\nThe celebrations in Ayodhya \"indicate a change in the direction of the Indian state\", he added, referring to the participation of top celebrities and saints, where state-owned helicopters showered rose petals over the city. \"This temple is a celebration of victory of violence against Muslims and it has been legitimised. Modi linked the source of nationhood to divinity [of Ram]; all values of the Indian republic stand destroyed.\"\n\nIndia has been continuously slipping in international democracy indices and was tagged \"partly free\" for the third year in a row by Freedom House, a US government-funded nonprofit. Human Rights Watch warned last year of the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) \"systematic discrimination and stigmatisation of religious and other minorities, particularly Muslims\".\n\nThe chest-thumping rise of Hindu nationalism and apparent departure from secular values also pose troubling questions for India's international allies, especially in the West, who have strengthened ties with New Delhi in recent years and view it as a counterweight to China.\n\n\"Modi has now positioned India to become a Hindu state in a formal sense, a move that would be welcomed by his large base but decried by many non-Hindus and critics as a betrayal of India's secular traditions,\" said Michael Kugelman, the director of the Wilson Center's South Asia Institute.\n\nWon't 'satiate the bloodlust'\n\nModi and the BJP appear poised for a comfortable win in the upcoming 2024 national election, according to most polls and many political observers. The PM did not need the temple opening to bolster his electoral prospects, said Kugelman, but the consecration gives him another shot in the arm. \"He delivered on one of his most longstanding promises and has come through in a big way that will ripple across his electoral base - and beyond,\" he added.\n\nBut the construction of the temple will fail to \"satiate the bloodlust\" of the Hindu nationalist movement that went mainstream with the demolition of the mosque in Ayodhya in 1992, argued Apoorvanand. After the ceremony, he saw slogans being raised in his university for the demolition of other mosques contested by the far-right in the cities of Mathura and Varanasi.\n\n\"There is no closure to all of this,\" he said, adding that the temple opening \"will only lead to more violence and those violent forces getting emboldened\".\n\nHarsh Mander, a prominent civil rights activist, could not bring himself to watch the broadcast of the consecration, he said. Instead, he gathered in Kolkata, a city in eastern India, for an \"anti-fascism march\" with thousands of others. Similar marches were organised by student and activist groups in different parts of India. On social media, Modi's critics shared snaps of the preamble to the Indian constitution, which guarantees equal rights to all citizens, irrespective of religion.\n\nMeanwhile, far-right groups interrupted screenings of a documentary titled Ram ke Naam (In the name of Ram), on the 1992 attack on the Babri Masjid, and attacked students at a university in Pune, 160km (100 miles) from Mumbai, for putting up banners remembering the Babri Masjid demolition.\n\n\"The consecration day is an important milestone in the history of the collapse of India's secular democracy,\" Mander said in a phone interview with Al Jazeera. \"It is a question of the soul of India. Is it the Hindutva conscience over secular, constitutional morality?\"\n\nAddressing the nation on the eve of Republic Day, India's President Droupadi Murmu recalled the Ram Mandir opening in Ayodhya. \"Future historians will consider it a landmark in India's continued re-discovery of its civilisational heritage,\" she said.\n\nBut for millions in India, the idea of nation is slipping away fast, said Mander. \"Indian people will prevail [over Hindu nationalism] - but it will be a long battle. Maybe a generation. Too much poison has been injected into the veins of our society.\"__aljazeera.com",

        "text": "Like the Jewish State, India too is guilty of repeated violations of the international law and it is time the world community takes serious notice of the growing intransigence of New Delhi that poses grave threats to regional and global peace and security. Apart from what it is doing to Kashmiris, who are demanding nothing but their birth right of self-determination, India is trampling on the rights of its minorities, especially Muslims and Sikhs and its secret agencies are also engaged in killing its own nationals and others abroad. The latest is the revelation by Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi that Pakistan has \"credible evidence\" on Indian agents' link to the killing of two of its citizens on Pakistani soil, exposing the \"sophisticated and sinister\" Indian campaign of extra-territorial and extra-judicial killings.\n\nThis is yet another manifestation of India's scant respect for international law despite its eagerness to capture a permanent berth at the UN Security Council. In fact, there is strong and undeniable evidence to confirm that India was a state-sponsor of terrorism and Pakistan exposed the ugly face of the neighbouring country in comprehensive dossiers that were provided to the United Nations and important world capitals detailing Indian involvement in acts of terrorism and sabotage in Balochistan, KP and Karachi. The statement of the Foreign Secretary comes after both Canada and the United States separately accused Indian agents of being linked to assassination attempts on their soil. These episodes triggered diplomatic tension with these countries that strongly condemned the incidents and wanted an explanation from New Delhi. The Foreign Secretary rightly pointed out that these are killings-for-hire cases involving a sophisticated international set-up spread over multiple jurisdictions. Providing details of the \"sophisticated and sinister\" Indian campaign of killings inside Pakistan, Qazi said the Indian agents used technology and safe havens on foreign soil to commit assassinations in Pakistan. All this shows the scale and magnitude of India's clandestine operations to eliminate voices of dissent in foreign countries and that this is being done as a state policy in the absence of any worthwhile response to such gruesome acts by the members of the international community. This is also confirmed by the reaction of the Indian media and social media, which were quick in claiming credit for such operations and glorification of the said killings as \"successful retribution against 'enemies' of India\" and projecting their capacity to carry out these illegal acts. What Pakistan said were not mere accusations as all those involved in reconnaissance and killing have been apprehended and are being tried in a court of law. Pakistan also has evidence of transactions made in the process linking the entire chain to an Indian agent Yogesh Kumar. Credit also goes to the investigators for identifying quickly the facilitators inside the country and in the third countries on the basis of confessional statements and technical evidence. As highlighted by the Foreign Secretary, these cases fit the pattern of similar cases that have come to light in other countries, including Canada and the United States, clearly showing that the Indian network of extra-judicial and extra-territorial killings has become a global phenomenon. The latest incidents constitute grave violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and warrant a strong response as protection of its own people and the foreign nationals on the soil of Pakistan is the fundamental responsibility of the Government. India previously carried out air attack in Balakot and received a befitting response and a firm message was also transmitted by Pakistan when it lost no time in responding to the violation of its sovereignty by Iran. Apart from sponsoring acts of terrorism in neighbouring countries, India is also usurping rights of its minorities in a crude manner as evident in Jammu and Kashmir, Indian Punjab, Nagaland and other regions. The recent events in the backdrop of construction of Ram Temple in place of a historical mosque in Ayodhya also speak volumes about the plight of Muslim in that country. Emboldened by the officially-sponsored discrimination against Muslims, extremist Hindus demolished shops and vandalized transport owned by Muslims. Aaker Patel of Amnesty International said in a statement that this week's drive in Mumbai represented a \"policy of arbitrarily and punitively demolishing Muslim properties following episodes of communal violence\". Official demolition drives have also been employed in numerous Indian states ruled by Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in recent years against the homes of people accused of participating in anti-government protests but main targets have always been Muslims. Following religious clashes sparked by this week's opening of the controversial Hindu temple in India, Pakistan has urged the United Nations to take action for the protection of Islamic sites in India. Pakistan's UN envoy Munir Akram shared the plea during an OIC ambassadorial meeting at the UN headquarters in New York on Wednesday, condemning the recent consecration of the Ram temple on the site of the demolished Babri Masjid. The Ambassador also addressed a letter to Miguel Angel Moratinos, a top official for the UN Alliance of Civilisations cautioning that this trend poses a significant threat to the social, economic and political wellbeing of Indian Muslims as well as to the harmony and peace in the region. The letter by Pakistan's UN envoy highlighted the urgency for intervention in safeguarding Islamic heritage sites in India but practical moves will have to be initiated to pressurize India to respect religious rights of Muslim and their cultural heritage as apart from Ayodhya, a number of other mosques in many cities and regions also face existential threats on the basis of false claims being made by Hindu zealots. We hope that the upcoming OIC ambassadorial meeting would address these concerns on a broader scale and recommend a concrete plan of action to the OIC besides formulating a united policy at UN and other international forums. In light of the killings of two individuals by Indian agents, Pakistan should take the issue to all available forums and seek a UN-led probe to look into the extra-judicial killings and state-sponsored terrorism by India. The evidence that Pakistan posses should also be shared with the United Nations and friendly countries to expose India's black face.",

        "title": "Construction of run-of-the river dams imperative to avert looming water crisis - Daily Times",
        "text": "Highly vulnerable to climate change and desertification, Pakistan is being faced with looming water crisis due to lack of rains and snowfalls besides fast melting of glaciers putting lives of millions people at risk due to emerging food security challenges.\n\nBeing the most water stressed country in world due to shortage of dams and runner of the river (ROR) projects despite plenty of suitable sites for construction of water reservoirs in northern parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, the country's water availability has been consistently declining due to mismanagement of water resources, unchecked car washing stations, deforestation and climate change. \"Pakistan is mostly relying on glaciers for its water needs. However, the lack of rains and snow falls this year in winter signified the country's water vulnerability that may create food security challenges besides energy crisis in years ahead if we do not construct run of the river dams being cost and time efficient\", said Tauheedul Haq, former Conservator of Forests while talking to APP.\n\nReferring to the National Water Policy 2018, he said that per capita surface water availability has declined from 5,260 cubic meter per annum in 1951 to a significant 1000 cubic meters in 2016 and feared that this quantity would likely to further decrease by about 860 cubic meter in next few years if deforestation and population bulge continued and water of rivers were not stored through better water management.\n\nWith glaciers retreat, he said more glacial lakes would be formed especially in Chitral and Swat besides Gilgit-Baltistan with high chances of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GOLF) as evident at Attabad lake GOLF that necessitated more runner of the river dams in Rivers Swat, Kunhar at Kaghan, Naran and Punjokora Dir Upper most suited for these kinds of hydel projects besides averting flash floods.\n\nDr Professor Zilakat Malik, former Chairman Economics Department, University of Peshawar said that climate change, 240.954 million population bulge and technological advancement started exerting pressure on energy resources in the country that was already facing about 7,000 megawatts (MW) shortfall affecting GDP growth.\n\nHe said the promotion of run-of-the-river (ROR) hydroelectricity would be required to bridge the widening demand-supply gap of electricity besides fulfilling the pressing demands of affordable energy of the consumers increasing with each passing day in the wake of mushroom growth of IT and agriculture sectors.\n\nHe said that the energy consumption share of industries has increased by 28 percent during July-April 2022 from 26.3 percent recorded in July-April 2021 while the share of the agriculture sector jacked up to nine percent from 8.9 percent during the same period. The 2022 devastating floods have adversely affected the country's agriculture, economy, livestock, and energy sectors as scores of mini micro-hydel stations were swept away by the gushing water that inflicted over USD 40 billion in economic losses to the government kitty.\n\n\"We need to adopt the culture of construction of small water reservoirs and ROR projects being cost and time-efficient and is very popular in developed countries to avert water crisis\", he said.\n\nDr Zilakat Malik said China had constructed about 98,000 dams, India 5,324 dams and only 150 dams by Pakistan. He said despite the huge 30,000 MW hydel potential of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, not a single dam was constructed in Pakistan after the Tarbela dam was built on River Indus in 1984 with an estimated cost of USD1.49 billion.\n\nCiting examples of ROR dams in the world, he said that Canada is generating about USD 140 million annual revenues from Niagara ROR dams attracting over one million tourists every year. Similarly, Hoover RoR dam on the Colorado River generates about USD 250 annual revenue for the USA and the Three Gorges ROR Dam on Yangtze River contributed USD 1.5 billion in tourism revenue in 2019 to the economy of China.\n\nEngr Zahoor Hussain, Director of Projects Wapda said that ROR hydroelectricity is a type of hydroelectric generation plant whereby little or no water storage is provided for electricity generation.\n\nHe said ROR hydroelectricity was considered ideal for rivers and streams that could sustain a minimum flow or those regulated by a lake or reservoir upstream. He said a small dam was usually built to create a head pond ensuring that there is enough water entering the penstock pipes that lead to the turbines which are at lower elevations.\n\nEngr Zahoor said ROR was a prime source of renewable energy that does not produce greenhouse gases and can easily be located in remote areas where other forms of energy generation were not feasible besides these could be built quickly and required less investment than conventional dams.\n\nHe said Chitral, Kohistan, Upper Mansehra, Dir, and Swat in KP, Northern Punjab, Azad Kashmir, and Gilgit Baltistan (GB) rivers were most suited for ROR dams. He said the Grand Coulee dam at Washington USA and the Itaipu dam on River Parana between Brazil and Paraguay were the world's largest ROR projects that generate electricity from the natural flow of the rivers.\n\nEngr Zahoor said that the construction of ROR hydroelectricity projects in these areas would help provide clean, renewable, and affordable energy to the local population that could be a valuable addition to the national grid. However, ROR dams can harm the environment and ecology such as disrupting fish migration and altering water quality.\n\nEngineer Muhammad Luqman Khan, Chief Planning Officer, of KP Energy Department said that under the power generation policy 2015, an inclusive strategy has been adopted for promoting the culture of ROR dams in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Under the strategy, he said the focus was being made on awareness campaigns for educating people about the significance of ROR dams and their role in clean energy generation, water resource management, and economic development.\n\nHe said ROR could be achieved by offering financial incentives, tax breaks, and a speedy approval process under public partnership mode. \"Faster collaboration with international organizations and countries that have experience in ROR projects was a key area of the government strategy to promote such culture in the country and especially in the province for socio-economic development of people besides averting the looming water crisis\", he concluded.",

Canada and the United States in the recent past have also alleged India for conducting similar assassinations.\n\nIn the last two years, over a dozen people were assassinated in mysterious target killings in Pakistan. Most of those who were killed had one thing in common: They were either Kashmiris or linked with its cause and all of them were wanted by India one way or the other.\n\nPakistan, for so long, kept a mum over those mysterious killings.\n\nHowever, on Thursday, Foreign Secretary Cyrus Qazi appeared on the media and disclosed that India was behind at least in two cases based on the investigations conducted by the authorities so far. The two target killings involve Shahid Latif, who was killed in Sialkot in October 2023 and Muhammad Riaz, who was murdered in Rawalakot in September the same year.\n\nRead more: India orchestrated killings on our soil: FO\n\nPakistan, according to the foreign secretary, has credible evidence to link Indian secret agencies with the target killings.\n\nAn official familiar with the investigations told The Express Tribune on Friday that Pakistan would brief Canada and the US about its investigations. Similarly, it would also take into confidence members of the UNSC about the \"sinister\" campaign by India.\n\nThe official said that India used a very sophisticated and well-organised campaign to take out those targets. The Indian agents, operating from a third country, used petty criminals and people with a \"Jihadi mindset\" to execute their plans in Pakistan.\n\nThey used different techniques. For example, in the case of Muhammad Riaz, an Indian agent tried to trace him by telling the locals that Latif owed Rs20 million to him and he wanted to find his whereabouts. Many local people involved in this sinister campaign were misled and, in some cases, did not even know about the plans of their handlers operating from outside.\n\nAlso read: Kashmiris to observe India's 'Republic Day' as Black Day\n\nThe Indian agents through local assets tried to brainwash one Abdullah on religious lines to assassinate Shahid Latif. The official said that Pakistan not only had confessional statements of the accused but had the money trail, linking Indian agents with those killings.\n\nThe official emphasised that Pakistan's move to highlight such cases must not be taken in a \"usual, India-Pakistan public posturing.\"\n\n\"This is a serious issue and a breach of our territorial integrity and sovereignty,\" the official added, who would not provide details as to why India was after them.\n\nThe official made it clear that India never shared any information about those who got killed in those target assassinations. \"Even if someone did a crime, there has to be due process of law.

Indeed, Indian law grants virtual legal immunity to any type of war crime or crime against humanity perpetrated in Kashmir.\"\n\n\"The only solution to the problem lies in allowing the people of Kashmir to exercise their unrestricted right to self-determination to decide their destiny - a pledge given to them by the world community some 77 years ago,\" Fai said.\n\n\"If the Kashmir question were resolved, much of the hostility between India and Pakistan would dissolve and the region would not be living on the edge of a nuclear holocaust,\" the Kashmiri leader said.'\n\n\"Trade between the two countries would flourish, jobs would be created\", he said, adding it would also release Pakistan from a crippling burden.\n\n\"Those 900,000 Indian military and paramilitary forces could go home and do something constructive instead of beating up on women and children,\" Fai said.\n\n\" What intelligent person could not agree with that? The refusal of omission to take a well-considered initiative neither responds to a long-term peace strategy nor answers the demand of the human conscience.\"",

        "text": "Pakistan has credible evidence of India's sophisticated and sinister campaign of extra-territorial and extra-judicial killings inside Pakistan. This was stated by Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi at a news briefing in Islamabad this evening. He said Pakistani authorities have credible evidence of links between Indian agents and assassins of two Pakistani nationals on Pakistani soil. He said Indian agents used technology and safe havens on foreign soil to commit assassinations in Pakistan. They recruited, financed and supported criminals, terrorists and unsuspecting civilians to play defined roles in these assassinations. The Foreign Secretary said Indian agent Yogesh Kumar, based in a third country orchestrated the assassination of Pakistani citizen Shahid Latif, through criminals and terrorists, in Sialkot. Besides, Indian agents Ashok Kumar Anand and Yogesh Kumar were involved in the killing of Pakistani citizen Muhammad Riaz in Rawalakot. Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi said that Pakistani auth orities have apprehended the assassins hired by the Indian agents. He said Pakistan has documentary, financial and forensic evidence of the involvement of the two Indian agents, who masterminded these assassinations. The Foreign Secretary said Indian network of extra-judicial and extra-territorial killings has become a global phenomenon, which is evident from the involvement of Indian agents in masterminding similar acts in Canada and the United States. He said it is critical to bring to justice the killers, their facilitators and financers involved in these assassinations. Indian agents need to face justice for its extra-judicial and extra- territorial killings in other countries. The Foreign Secretary said India must be held accountable internationally for its blatant violation of international law. He said India's assassination of Pakistan nationals on Pakistani soil is violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and a breach of the UN Charter. This violation of Pakistan sovereignty by India is completely unac ceptable. Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi expressed Pakistan's commitment to protecting its people and securing its sovereignty. He said protection of Pakistanis and any foreign national on Pakistani soil is a high priority for Pakistan. He said India's reckless and irresponsible act calls into question India's reliability as a credible international player and its claims for enhanced global responsibilities. The Foreign Office has also released passport details of Yogesh Kumar and Ashok Kumar Anand. According to the details, Yogesh Kumar was born on Ninth October 1996 in Sriganganagar, Rajashtan, whereas Ashok Kumar Anad was born on First of July 1958 in Kolya area of Karnataka.
