        "title": "The Biden-Putin war of words has worrying repercussions",
        "text": "When the leaders of two global superpowers take personal jabs at each other, their very public exchange becomes more than a mere spectacle. It becomes a source of anxiety and alarm.\n\nUS President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin have engaged in a war of words in recent days, and as both men seek re-election at different points this year, the foreign policy dimensions of these elections extend from Europe to the Middle East and the Red Sea.\n\nDespite the notion that Mr Putin favours Mr Biden's re-election - as he said last Wednesday - several reasons suggest otherwise. Chief among them is Mr Biden's pivotal role in galvanising Nato and fortifying its support for Ukraine, ultimately expanding the group's membership. Russia's international standing has declined lately, due in part to American and European sanctions after the outbreak of war in Ukraine two years ago.\n\nIn contrast to Mr Biden, his predecessor and presumptive opponent - Donald Trump - is vowing to resolve the Ukraine conflict not through military decisiveness that would favour Kyiv but through a deal with Moscow. Mr Trump has also pledged unequivocally that Ukraine will not join Nato on his watch. It is a position that, logically speaking, would favour Russia.\n\nThis means that Mr Putin's suggestion that Moscow would like to see Mr Biden defeat Mr Trump appears to be a tactic to unsettle the US administration. Mr Biden surely knows this, particularly as the governing Democratic Party holds lingering resentment towards the Kremlin for historical reasons, accusing it of meddling in the 2016 presidential election that led to Mr Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton.\n\nHowever, this does not imply that Moscow eagerly awaits a Trump presidency, especially due to his unpredictability.\n\nEven as he sparred verbally with Mr Biden, Mr Putin took to the skies aboard a modernised, Soviet-era nuclear bomber to remind the West of its potency in potential nuclear conflicts. In response, the US cautioned against launching nuclear anti-satellite weapons into space, categorising it as a perilous escalation in Cold War power dynamics and a breach of the 1967 treaty prohibiting the deployment of nuclear weapons in space.\n\nMoscow denied having any intentions to manufacture and launch weapons into space, accusing the Biden administration of a \"malicious fabrication\" aimed at securing US Congressional approval for military aid to Ukraine. Concurrently, American diplomats mobilised efforts to garner international condemnation against Russia, reaching out not only to the G7 but also to China and India, urging them to censure Moscow for jeopardising global stability with a potential nuclear arms race in space.\n\nThe US Department of the Treasury then announced sanctions on more than 500 entities and individuals, coinciding with the second anniversary of the war in Ukraine. This marks the most extensive US sanctions package against Moscow to date. Some of these sanctions, crafted in collaboration with other nations, specifically target the Russian military-industrial complex and companies in third countries facilitating Moscow's alleged access to sanctioned goods.\n\nThese sanctions carry profound consequences for Russia and are aimed at increasing its international isolation. And yet today, isolation is not limited to Russia. It also affects the US - not due to the war in Ukraine but rather because of Washington's stand in the Gaza conflict.\n\nAt a recent G20 meeting in Brazil, America found itself isolated. It faced criticism for shielding Israel from accountability and for, once again, using its veto power to block a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nAt the meeting, ministers from various countries - including from allied nations such as Australia - spoke candidly, delivering sharp criticisms against Washington. Brazil and South Africa, along with other nations, expressed dissatisfaction with US protection of Israel and strong displeasure with Israeli actions against civilians in Gaza. Countries such as Spain, Ireland and Argentina were among those displaying dismay and anger too.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken avoided confrontation, responding simply by saying: \"There may be differences over tactics ... but we're trying to focus on actually getting results.\" Indeed, the Biden administration continues to seek a new formula to resolve the Gaza crisis, as it attempts to revive the two-state solution.\n\nThe Gaza issue holds less significance for Russia right now, as it remains focused on the war in Ukraine and on its rivalry with the West. What carry weight for Russia are assurances it has reportedly received from Iran, that the Houthi operations in the Red Sea will not affect Russian interests or those of its friends.\n\nIn a speech to be delivered on Thursday, Mr Putin is expected to clarify Russia's strategic position and the nature of its relations with the West. From describing it as no longer a friend of Moscow, will he label it an \"enemy\"? This would underscore the serious deterioration in relations and no foreseeable prospect of their restoration.\n\nThere are worries that tensions will escalate, reaching a dangerous confrontation between nuclear states. The danger lies particularly in the breakdown of communication between the Russia and the US.\n\nInternational confusion is evident in various files, notably the conflict in Ukraine and the Israel-Gaza war for the Europeans. The ongoing discussions do not focus on a comprehensive resolution to these conflicts. They settle for the limits of \"crisis management\" and working towards \"lasting stability\", not towards achieving a \"peaceful settlement\" or peace with unequivocal guarantees for Israeli security.\n\nRussia is outside the scope of the US's search for a new \"mechanism\" based on de-escalation and diplomatic resolution with vague assurances. Washington's focus, instead, is on a new axis that includes influential Arab countries, particularly those that have access to Hamas. I am given to understand that the Biden administration seeks to coerce Iran into persuading Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis to de-escalate. If successful, the chances of the war in Gaza expanding into a regional conflict are low.\n\nMeanwhile, the worry is that even as Mr Biden continues to tread cautiously with the Israeli government and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his war of words with Mr Putin has so far been unrestrained. In an election year, this carries added significance.",

        "text": "The LNG deal with India was worth $78 billion -- it was the moolah that did the trick, says Subir Bhaumik\n\nThe release of eight Indian Navy veterans accused of spying for Israel by Qatar, it would appear, had less to do with Prime Minister Modi's personal chemistry with the Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and more to do with the renewal of a lucrative LNG (liquified natural gas) 20-year purchase deal.\n\nOn the sidelines of India Energy Week on 5 February, India's largest gas importer, Petronet-LNG, and QatarEnergy signed an agreement extending the contract (due to expire in 2028) to import 7.5 million tonnes of LNG annually for an estimated $78 billion. Energy experts say the deal was favourable to India and would help save $6 billion over 20 years.\n\nWithin a week of this deal, the eight Navy veterans were let off and brought back home, their prison terms waived after a royal act of clemency. In October 2023, their death penalty had been commuted to imprisonment. Perhaps that was when Qatar became sure that India would renew the deal and not look for alternatives elsewhere.",

        "text": "Where can you watch all the latest Disney movies and shows, on top of the company's trove of animated classics? The answer is Disney+, a content-packed streaming platform that includes close to a century's worth of Disney shorts and features. You'll also be able to indulge in movies and shows from Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, Nat Geo, and 21st Century Fox.\n\nContents What does Disney Plus include?Where is Disney+ available?Which devices support Disney+?How much does Disney+ cost?Impressive video and audio qualityWhat it won't includeHow do I get Disney+?Show 2 more items\n\nHow much does Disney+ cost? How do I create an account? And can I watch the Star Wars prequels on the service? We'll answer all these questions and more in this everything-you-need-to-know Disney+ guide we've created.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nWhat does Disney Plus include?\n\nDisney+ currently hosts hundreds of Disney-related movies and television series. Classic animated features like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and Pinocchio are there, as is modern-day Disney Channel fare like Descendants, vintage live-action features including The Parent Trap and Old Yeller, forgotten oddities like the made-for-TV Fuzzbucket, a huge collection of '90s Marvel cartoons, almost every Star Wars flick, Pixar movies, and much, much more.\n\nRelated DAZN: What it is, how to get it, and everything else you need to know What is DirecTV Stream: plans, pricing, channels, and more Disney already knows if you're sharing your streaming account\n\nWhile the service includes most Marvel movies, there are still some MCU films that you can't find on Disney+ due to licensing agreements with other streamers, such as Netflix. Titles such as all of the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies and The Incredible Hulk are not yet available. You will, however, find all of the X-Men films, and, happily, the Star Wars universe is all present and accounted for on Disney Plus.\n\nDisney+'s original productions are where things get exciting. In addition to Star Wars TV shows like Obi-Wan Kenobi (which is set between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope and sees Ewan McGregor and Hayden Christensen reprising their roles from the prequel films), The Mandalorian, and The Book of Boba Fett -- Disney+ continues to host a slew of live-action Star Wars series. These include the Rogue One prequel, Star Wars: Andor, in which Diego Luna and Alan Tudyk will reprise their roles from that film, and Ahsoka, in which Rosario Dawson will continue her starring turn as Anakin Skywalker's embattled former Padawan.\n\nThe Marvel Cinematic Universe series Falcon and Winter Soldier, Loki, WandaVision, and Hawkeye have already hit big on Disney+, in which big-screen stars like Elizabeth Olsen and Tom Hiddleston reprised their roles that directly affected Marvel's big-screen adventures, including Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. The latest string of shows introduces new characters like Ms. Marvel, She-Hulk, and Moon Knight to the MCU before they appear in feature films.\n\nYou'll also find the entire Pixar library, including new movie releases like Elemental, Lightyear, and Turning Red, as well as the whole gamut of Disney Animation Studios films like Encanto and Raya and the Last Dragon.\n\nSpeaking of animation, Disney+ is now home to the entire Simpsons catalog, and after a fix for the aspect ratio was issued, they're all available in their original glory. The platform does not include the season 3 premiere episode, Stark Raving Dad, however, which features the voice of Michael Jackson.\n\nWhere is Disney+ available?\n\nIn North America, Disney+ is available in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. In Central America, you can watch Disney+ in Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama.\n\nEuropean subscribers can watch Disney+ in Albania, Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Ireland, Kosovo, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, San Marino, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and Vatican City.\n\nSouth American subscribers can watch Disney+ in Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Venezuela, Switzerland, and Uruguay. West Indies countries include Antigua & Barbuda, Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Haiti, Jamaica, St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent & the Grenadines, and Trinidad & Tobago.\n\nIn Africa, you can watch Disney+ in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, South Africa, and Tunisia. Middle East support includes the countries of Bahrain, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine Territories, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.\n\nSouth Pacific countries include Australia and New Zealand, and Asian subscribers can watch in Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.\n\nWhich devices support Disney+?\n\nDisney+ is available on:\n\nComputer web browsers iOS Apple TV (tvOS) Google Chromecast Android Android TV Roku Cox Contour TV and Stream Player Box Xfinity Flex and X1 TV Box Xbox, PlayStation Select Amazon Fire TV devices Smart TVs (LG WebOS, Samsung Tizen, Android TV, Google TV, Vizio SmartCast, Roku TV, Hisense smart TVs)\n\nIf you're an Apple device owner or you have one of the many smart TVs and streaming devices that feature the Apple TV app, you can subscribe to (and watch) Disney+ within that all-in-one streaming interface. Disney+ also supports in-app purchases on Apple devices. The Disney Plus website has the full list of supported devices.\n\nHow much does Disney+ cost?\n\nDisney+ costs $8 a month if you don't mind advertising. (There's no annual option with that scheme.) If you want to get rid of ads, it'll cost you $14 a month, or $140 a year.\n\nHowever, Disney+ isn't Disney's only streaming service. Following its acquisition of 21st Century Fox, Disney also controls Hulu, and it also offers the sports-focused ESPN+.\n\nDisney Bundle Duo Premium, which includes Disney+ and Hulu without ads for $20 a month. Disney Bundle Duo Basic, which includes Disney+ and Hulu (both with ads) for $10 per month. Disney Bundle Trio Basic with sports which includes Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ (all with ads) for $15 per month. Disney Bundle Trio Premium with Disney+, Hulu (both with no ads), and ESPN+ (with ads) for $25 per month.\n\nHulu pricing now comes in as the following:\n\nHulu with ads: $8 a month, or $80 a year. Hulu without ads: $18 a month, with no annual option. Hulu With Live TV is $77 a month with advertising on the on-demand content, and $90 a month without ads. Disney+ (with ads) add-on is $2 a month. ESPN+ add-on is $11 a month.\n\nAnd ESPN+ pricing is:\n\n$11 a month, or $110 a year.\n\nImpressive video and audio quality\n\nDisney+ offers select content in Dolby Vision, Dolby's dynamic version of HDR that offers evolving content to supported TVs to squeeze the best contrast out of each scene, as well as Dolby Atmos, which provides an immersive, hemispheric soundstage for those with supported hardware.\n\nWhile Dolby Vision is becoming more common, both Vision and Atmos are still rarities in streaming land, supported by only a few services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Apple TV+ and available on a limited but growing amount of content. One of the most tantalizing aspects of Disney+'s 4K content -- for Star Wars fans at least -- is the availability of its Star Wars films, including the original trilogy (that is, the '90s special editions) in 4K with Dolby Vision and Atmos support. This makes Disney+ the only way to view these films in these formats.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough, 15 of its MCU movies are available in IMAX format, which makes the image 26% taller (if your TV or projector is capable).\n\nFor those wondering about family viewing, Disney+ offers four simultaneous streams at once on its service for its basic $8-per-month fee.\n\nWhat it won't include\n\nIn keeping with Disney's family-friendly approach to programming, there won't be any R-rated projects available on Disney+. Any movies or TV series that push the boundaries of Disney's typical PG-13 audience will be diverted to Hulu, according to various reports. This includes titles like Marvel's Deadpool.\n\nHow do I get Disney+?\n\nStarting a Disney+ subscription is as easy as heading over to the Disney+ website and creating an account. Once you've selected a membership, you'll be able to start streaming movies and shows right away.\n\nUnfortunately, at this time, Disney+ does not offer a free trial for any of its subscription tiers.\n\nEditors' Recommendations What's new on Disney+ in February 2024 5 best Christmas movies on Disney+ you should watch 5 Adam Driver movies you should stream right now Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ get new pricing schemes this fall FITE and FITE+: Everything you need to know",

        "text": "SINGAPORE (Reuters): Record numbers attended the trade section of the first fully post-pandemic Singapore Airshow this week, with exhibitors and delegates optimistic about the aviation industry despite suppliers' struggles to keep up with rebounding travel demand.\n\nClose to 60,000 people attended the four trade days of the show, nearly four times as many as in 2022 when foreign visitors required daily rapid tests for Covid-19, and more than the 54,000 who visited in 2018. The 2020 edition was rocked by last-minute cancellations as the virus spread around the world.\n\nOutside Asia's largest air show, transport problems snarled arrivals and departures, especially during the first days. On Tuesday, lines for free shuttle buses to the Expo public transport hub led to waits as long as three hours in temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) and taxis to the city cost as much as three times the usual fare.\n\n\"'Worst transport experience': Crawling traffic, long waits for rides frustrate Singapore Airshow visitors\", ran a headline in local newspaper the Straits Times.\n\nLeck Chet Lam, managing director of show organiser Experia, blamed \"higher attendance than in previous editions\".\n\nIn the air-conditioned display space, commercial exhibitors hawked planes, drones, surveillance technology, services and equipment. The displays attracted buyers and enthusiasts, with the Korea Aerospace Industries booth drawing a line on Wednesday for attendees to get pilots' autographs and pose for selfies.\n\nMore than 1,000 commercial and defence companies from 50 countries participated in the show, organisers said.\n\nRussian companies did not take part amid the war in Ukraine but Israeli companies Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which dropped out of the Dubai Airshow in November amid the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, attended.\n\n\"The general mood is extremely positive but also very demanding,\" said Dennis Kohr, head of corporate sales Asia-Pacific for aircraft maintenance provider Lufthansa Technik Group.\n\n\"It's the first air show after the pandemic; there is not only a huge demand for air travel, but also huge demand for MRO services,\" he added, referring to maintenance, repair and overhaul.\n\nNatasha Pheiffer, regional managing director for Asia at British defence firm BAE Systems, said it was great to see attendees face to face again.\n\n\"We had a really busy week ... discussing future air capability, our space and autonomous air technologies, our cyber, electronic warfare, sea, and land offering and our presence across Asia,\" she said.\n\nThe Indonesian Air Force Jupiter aerobatics team performs maneuvers during a flying display at the Singapore Airshow in Singapore, on Wednesday, Feb. 22, 2024. The Singapore Airshow is Asia's most influential aerospace and defense exhibition. - Bloomberg\n\nAERIAL DISPLAY\n\nDelegates stepped into the tropical heat for around an hour of aerial displays each day, including demonstration flights by air force teams from Singapore, South Korea and India, among others, and a fly-by by the C919, made by China's COMAC. It was the first flight outside Chinese territory for COMAC's homegrown jet.\n\nCOMAC was also the first company to announce orders at the show, flagging a deal with Tibet Airlines for 40 C919 single-aisle planes and 10 ARJ21 regional jets, plus six ARJ21s for China's Henan Civil Aviation Development and Investment Group.\n\nShortly afterwards, Royal Brunei Airlines said it was ordering four Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners.\n\nAirbus announced an order for five A350 freighters and three A330neo widebody passenger jets from Taiwan's Starlux Airlines. Airbus also had a provisional deal with Vietnamese budget carrier VietJet for 20 A330neo wide-body airliners.\n\nSustainability was in focus, with Singapore announcing a green jet fuel mandate to be funded by a levy on travellers and air show organisers stressing the importance of protecting the environment, but the industry remains divided over how to achieve its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nSupply chain issues clouded some of the show's optimism, with exhibitors citing long lead times and high costs, which have dogged the industry since COVID and worsened after Russia invaded Ukraine. The problems have been especially acute for raw materials such as aerospace-grade metals.\n\nStill, Paul Bolton, chief operating officer of First Aviation Services, was hopeful the worst was over and that growing demand would lead manufacturers back to aerospace production.\n\n\"It will get better in maybe two to three years,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Xinghui Kok; Additional reporting by Brenda Goh; Editing by Jamie Freed, Gerry Doyle and Mark Potter) - Reuters",

        "text": "Four months after Hamas's cruel attack on Israel, the Gaza Strip lies in ruins. Its 2.2 million inhabitants are jobless, most of them homeless. Reconstruction of Gaza is essential for preventing a huge humanitarian crisis and is one of the elements of a plan for \"long-term peace between Israel and Palestinians\" that the Biden administration and a \"small group of Middle East partners\" are developing. Gaza's reconstruction, properly done and supervised, combined with political arrangements and without any terrorist organization involvement, can bring about a positive change in the turbulent region.\n\nSaudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed Bin Salman and the UAE ruler Mohammed Bin Zayed, whose countries are among these \"Middle East partners,\" are the two people who can lead this rebuilding operation. Both rulers, who compete for regional influence, have the financial and the operational capacity to lead the mega project of Gaza reconstruction. No other international power has both the interest and ability to do it. The United States can help financially by allocating at least part of the frozen $120 billion of Iranian money to this enterprise.\n\nMBS and MBZ share the belief that the future of the Middle East is not secured by religious and political violent conflict, but rather by progress and development of a knowledge-based economy, which will replace the oil-based economy. In both countries, there are giant governmental and semi-governmental companies that can easily build projects for housing, transportation, tourism, energy, and industry.\n\nIn 2005, I introduced the CEO of the largest construction company in the Middle East, Emaar Properties, to Ariel Sharon, then Israel's prime minister. Sharon's government intended to evacuate and destroy the Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip as part of the Disengagement Plan. The Emirati company offered Israel $56 million if, instead of destroying the settlements, the Israeli government would hand them over, as-is, to the company. It wanted to use them as a basis and infrastructure for its housing and tourism projects in the no-longer occupied Gaza. The meeting with Sharon was friendly, but the Israeli cabinet decided to destroy the settlements.\n\nThis story illustrates that rebuilding the Gaza Strip is not an act of charity. The two countries involved and their companies would benefit handsomely. For example, if the Emirati company DP World were to be in charge of building the deep-water port in Gaza, it would not lose money. On the contrary, a Gaza seaport, like the ones in Haifa and Ashdod, can be the Mediterranean end of the India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC).\n\nAnd in 2008, I co-authored with Samer Khoury, the Palestinian owner of CCC, the Greece-located conglomerate, a \"Marshall Plan\" for Gaza. It included projects for tourism, agriculture, transportation, industry, and energy. Each project could provide employment for Gazans, a dramatic improvement in the quality of life in Gaza, and income for the entrepreneurs.\n\nHamas, on the other hand, spent its billions of dollars on building the largest terror base on earth, but not on one single economic project. The people of Gaza are hard-working and diligent. I saw many lining up at 2 a.m. at the Erez crossing point, waiting hours to cross the Israeli border for their hard work in Israel, eager to feed their children. At dark they made their way back home for a few hours' sleep, returning to Erez the next morning. Their lives would be significantly enhanced by a sweeping economic recovery plan for Gaza.\n\nBut the chief incentive for the United States, Saudi Arabia and the UAE in such an endeavor would not be humanitarian or economic, but geopolitical. Biden, Bin Salman and Bin Zayed hold the key to resolving the main issues in the Middle East.\n\nRegrettably, the current Israeli prime minister has already rejected out of hand a project of this kind, calling the Biden-initiated plan still being worked on an \"international diktat.\" But a sane government in Israel - which I believe will be formed in 2024 -- cannot refuse such an offer from the US and Gulf states to rebuild Gaza, even if it includes negotiations with the Palestinians on a two-state solution.\n\nJust three weeks ago, MBS repeated his \"desire and determination to pursue normalization\" with Israel, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, but that step required calm in Gaza and \"a clear and credible pathway to a Palestinian state.\" More recently, UAE's ambassador to the United Nations said there must be an \"irreversible progression\" towards a two-state solution to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict for a regional commitment to the reconstruction of Gaza. And a few days later reports surfaced about the Biden plan that would offer Israel \"normalization with Saudi Arabia and other Arab states\" as part of a package leading to the \"establishment of a Palestinian state.\"\n\nTo be clear: Hamas must not govern Gaza again. Israel must not either, but its current government seems headed in this direction. If it does, it would not be exempt from the civilian responsibility for the 2.2 million Palestinians living there. Israel does not have the resources for both military control and civilian administration of the Strip. And no one will share this huge burden with Israel.\n\nIsrael's withdrawal from Gaza without the return of Hamas is feasible only if the military and administrative control of this territory is handed to a joint administration - a partnership between the reconstructing states and the Palestinian Authority. There are enough Palestinians with civilian experience and various professional skills who can do this perfectly well.\n\nNeither we the Israelis nor any international player has the right to say whom the Palestinian leadership would include, but it cannot be Hamas or Islamic Jihad figures. Whoever leads the Palestinian Authority will not be able to reject such a political-economic package offered by the US, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.\n\nThus, the opportunity exists for a historic package combining a diplomatic solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, eradication of Hamas's military capabilities, reconstruction of Gaza and Saudi-Israeli normalization. It would generate significant geopolitical and financial benefits for all involved. Seizing this opportunity is primarily up to MBS and MBZ, with the active support of Biden. It could well be their finest hour on the world stage.",

        "text": "Beijing will be the backdrop this year for gatherings of Latin American and African leaders, part of a long-standing relationship with developing countries\n\nChina is promoting itself as an alternative to the West-led international order, analyst says\n\nChina\u2019s push for diplomatic influence in the \u201cGlobal South\u201d will be on show later this year when Beijing hosts two major gatherings \u2013 one for Africa and the other for Latin America.\n\nIn addition to the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), the Chinese capital will be the backdrop for the China-Latin American and Caribbean Forum (China-CELAC).\n\nThe last time FOCAC was held, in 2021, President Xi Jinping pledged to advance US$40 billion in loans and aid to African countries, on top of the US$60 billion pledged in 2018.\n\nDuring the 2021 China-CELAC forum, Beijing pledged to cooperate in areas including infrastructure, education, and green energy. Between 2000 and 2022, China had pledged more than US$170 billion in Chinese loans while CELAC countries had received US$130 billion.\n\nPaul Nantulya, a China specialist at the National Defence University\u2019s Africa Centre for Strategic Studies in Washington, said the summits were part of China\u2019s efforts to counter the US-dominated international system.\n\n\u201cThe two multilateral forums are part of a system of multilateral institutions that China built over the past two decades in an effort to construct an alternative international architecture alongside the current global order,\u201d Nantulya said.\n\nFOCAC was established in 2000, when China was venturing overseas in search of markets for its products and raw materials for its industries. Plans for the China-CELAC forum were unveiled four years later.\n\nChina has traditionally used the gatherings to announce billions of dollars in funding through its Belt and Road Initiative to build ports, railways, dams and highways.\n\nChinese lending in the Global South between 2008 and 2021 was the equivalent of 83 per cent of all World Bank lending to that region over the same period.\n\nBut the forums are about more than financing.\n\nChina has a special relationship with the developing world, having backed numerous anti-colonial, anti-apartheid, and national liberation movements, and has always relied on Global South countries whenever it has faced international isolation or mounting rivalries with Western powers.\n\n\u201cGlobal South countries tend to vote alongside China and support Chinese initiatives at the multilateral level,\u201d Nantulya said.\n\nAt the same time, many Global South organisations that had lost steam have come back to life in recent years as demands \u2013 echoed by China \u2013 for the reform of the Western-dominated international system become sharper.\n\n\u201cChina is keen to leverage and align these demands, and the growing mood of Global South solidarity, with its own longer-range foreign policy goals,\u201d Nantulya said.\n\nJohn Calabrese, a senior fellow at the American University\u2019s Middle East Institute in Washington, said the revival of the Non-Aligned Movement and Group of 77 was helping to drive change of a global financial system and multilateral institutions that were widely seen as outdated and unfair.\n\n\u201cThe US-led \u2018liberal international order\u2019 has clearly come under strain. The re-emergence of the NAM and the G77 seems to reflect efforts to find ways to build a new global order,\u201d Calabrese said.\n\n\u201cBeijing\u2019s diplomatic response to the Israel-Hamas war, especially in UN Security Council proceedings, is a vivid illustration of a broader effort to align with and position itself as the champion of the so-called Global South,\u201d Calabrese said, in reference to China\u2019s push for an immediate \u201chumanitarian ceasefire\u201d and a \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d.US development official contrasts \u2018big-hearted\u2019 aid with China \u2018debt traps\u2019\n\nChina\u2019s efforts to present itself as a champion for the Global South are paying off in many ways, according to David Shullman, senior director of the Global China Hub at the Atlantic Council.\n\n\u201cChina is now Africa\u2019s largest trading partner and second-largest for Latin America and the Caribbean,\u201d he told an Atlantic Council event last week.\n\nAccording to Shullman, targeted belt and road investments in Central America have helped entice the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua to switch diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. eSwatini is the only African country that still recognises Taiwan.\n\n\u201cSix Pacific island countries recognised Taiwan but the number has been cut to half. China has deepened its economic and in some cases political and economic relationships with those nations with significant geopolitical implications,\u201d Shullman said.Why neither China nor India will be leader of the Global South\n\nChina\u2019s growing diplomatic and economic influence in the Global South is causing disquiet in Washington.\n\nDaniel Kritenbrink, the US assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and the keynote speaker at the Atlantic Council event, said Beijing had benefited from the stability and opportunity that the international order had provided but was now advancing an alternative vision for global governance.\n\nThe US had noticed and was responding by deepening its relations with developing countries. For example, Kritenbrink said, the US hosted leaders of Pacific island nations for a summit last year. Embassies in the Solomon Islands and Tonga have also been opened while others in Vanuatu and Kiribati are planned.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not enough to just show up. It is not enough to just hold conferences and summits, it\u2019s about delivering. We are competing with [China] to offer a better value proposition to developing countries,\u201d Kritenbrink said.",

        "text": "A slowdown in exports over the previous few quarters has been a chief concern for Schaeffler India Ltd's buyers. In the December quarter (Q4CY23), exports have been 11% of income, the bottom in not less than two years. The firm follows the January to December monetary yr. Sure, exports represent a small portion of income now, however the development in abroad markets is essential for Schaeffler's income development going forward. \"Exports have comparatively increased margins as in comparison with home enterprise, it helps broaden distribution attain, and optimizes capability utilization, making it a vital development driver,\" stated Abhishek Gaoshinde, analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas.\n\nThe abroad markets noticed some robust headwinds in This autumn, and Schaeffler expects these challenges to persist. During This autumn, exports fell by 36% year-on-year as a consequence of slackening financial development in Europe and China. Demand started to sluggish within the abroad markets with the Ukraine struggle, and the battle in Israel added to the woes. A good portion of the corporate's exports is to Europe, with some additionally going to China, Schaeffler stated in its earnings name.

Given the weak demand tendencies in Europe and China, Schaeffler plans to discover South-East Asian markets resembling Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand to de-risk the export enterprise and improve the capability utilization. Besides, opposed gross sales combine impacted margin. In Q4CY23, consolidated Ebitda margin fell to 17.3% from 19.2% a yr in the past.

        "title": "Passage from India: Israel seeks workers to replace Palestinians",
        "text": "Flights and housing: The challenges to foreign worker importation Dozens of construction workers from India arrived in Israel last week but compared to the need, it's just a drop in the bucket. Yuval Nissani About 50 foreign construction workers from India arrived in Israel last week - first harbingers of the least 65,000 workers planned. For more than four months now, the construction industry has been coping with a huge shortage of labor, a consequence of stopping the entry into Israel of more than 100,000 Palestinian construction workers. But, in addition to the recruitment efforts, which have been going on for months, other challenges lie ahead.\n\nRecruitment progressing slowly\n\nSince the beginning of the war, about 20,000 foreign construction workers have been living in Israel. The latest government decision allows their number to increase by 45,000. The government also intends to approve bringing another 20,000 foreign workers \"privately\", meaning, directly through personnel agencies.\n\nGovernment officials hope to bring this quantity to Israel within two months, or three at the most. But this is an undertaking that Israel has never tried before: between 2013 and 2022, the number of foreign workers in Israel's construction industry increased by only about 15,000.\n\nAbout 1,000 workers from India have come to Israel recently. The first group of privately recruited laborers from India landed here last week. The ambitious idea of bringing in tens of thousands within two months seems a far stretch. There is also the question whether such large numbers of workers are available, and whether they even want to come.\n\nThe main effort is currently concentrated on three countries: India, Sri Lanka, and Uzbekistan. \"Globes\" has learned that the task is more difficult in the latter two, where recruitment is progressing slowly, and so most of the workers are expected to come from India.\n\nThe Ministry of Construction and Housing issued an update in mid-February, stating that 10,000 workers from the three countries had been organized so far, and Director General Yehuda Morgenstern stated that his goal was to arrange for another 20,000 workers by the end of March.\n\nIt is important to note that, by law, foreign construction workers may be imported only through officially approved staffing agencies. Until the war's outbreak, about 50 such companies operated in Israel; since then, an additional 150 companies have submitted applications, which may help speed up the process greatly. The submission deadline was the end of December, but according to information obtained by \"Globes\", only about ten applications have so far been approved by the Population and Immigration Authority. In normal times, the approval process takes about two years.\n\nAmnon Merhav, the current director general of the Ministry of Economy and Industry, and previously the CEO of Bonei Ha'aretz - the Economic Company of the Israel Builders Association, addressed the topic at the recent Israeli Building Center Group conference in Eilat, telling \"Globes\": \"The government needs to change its concept, and permit the private import of large numbers of workers. The claim that this method might lead to human trafficking and human rights violations is misplaced: it is precisely the quota system in practice today which creates a black market, and trade in permits and workers.\"\n\nCharter flights\n\nThe next challenge is management of the flights to Israel. If the intention is to bring at least 45,000 workers within two months, and each flight can accommodate up to 250 foreign workers, then about 20 flights are required to bring in about 5,000 workers per week. Even a lower number, about 10,000 workers per month, is no small matter.\n\n\"More than a regulatory operation, this is a logistical operation,\" says Bonei Ha'aretz CEO Igal Slovik.\"How should flight times be managed, how many will come in each day, where will they land - Ben Gurion Airport or Ramon Airport? These are all questions that, for the most part, the state will have to deal with.\"\n\nAccording to Yacov Amsalem, owner and CEO of travel company Amsalem Group, which is participating in the effort to bring workers to Israel, there is no difficulty in bringing large amounts of workers when needed. \"So far, we've only issued a few dozen tickets, mainly from India, although in the past few days the rate looked as though it was increasing slightly,\" he says. \"With these numbers, we can manage through existing commercial flights, and we can bring up to 10,000 workers per month in the same way. If necessary, we can set up charter flights on demand, within days, and bring in larger numbers as well.\" Incidentally, each worker pays for the ticket, whether commercial or charter flight (which is twice as expensive), out of his own pocket.\n\nAfter all these procedures are in place, housing the foreign workers will pose a new challenge. Until now, the industry relied on Palestinian laborers who returned home at the end of each day.\n\nWhere will the tens of thousands of foreign workers stay? At present, the chairperson of the Knesset Special Committee on Foreign Workers, MK Eliyahu Revivo (Likud), is formulating provisional legislation that will allow construction of temporary housing for foreign workers. \"As a result, labor productivity will increase significantly, construction times will be shortened, and contractors' expenses may decrease significantly, which will help in lowering housing prices,\" Revivo said. The bill will be put before the Knesset in the coming days, but matters will not be easy, even if it is approved quickly. It will take a considerable amount of time to find suitable locations, receive approvals, and construct the residences.",

While bibimbap was not the most-searched recipe in terms of raw numbers, this shows that more people have been interested in bibimbap and looking up recipes this year.\n\nGoogle announced Tuesday that bibimbap was its top trending recipe around the world for 2023. The other recipes on the list were espeto (a Spanish dish of skewered and grilled fish), papeda (Indonesian porridge made of starch), scooped bagel, and pasta e fagioli (an Italian soup made of beans and pasta).\n\nThis year's trending search terms are the ones whose web traffic has increased the most compared to last year.\n\nGoogle releases its \"year in search\" statistics each year. For 2023, it used search statistics running from Jan. 1 to Nov. 27.\n\nThe country where bibimbap was the most popular search in that timeframe was India, followed by Singapore, Sweden, the Philippines and Malaysia. Google explained that these country rankings do not reflect the absolute number of searches, but rather the search terms' percentage of total searches in each country.\n\nBibimbap did not make it onto the trending recipe list for Korean users. The trending recipes there were pickled garlic, seasoned oysters, spicy radish salad, potato salad, and green onion kimchi.\n\nIn addition to bibimbap, a number of Korean musicians and TV dramas appeared on this year's lists of trending search terms. For example, \"Cupid\" by idol group Fifty Fifty ranked fifth on global trending songs. \"Seven\" by BTS member Jungkook also came in at No. 10 on the list.\n\nIn Korea, the top trending song was (G)i-dle's \"Queencard,\" followed by \"Event Horizon\" by Younha, and \"OMG,\" \"ETA\" and \"Ditto\" all by NewJeans.\n\nKorean dramas \"King the Land\" (JTBC) and \"The Glory\" (Netflix) ranked sixth and seventh, respectively, on the list of trending TV shows across the globe.\n\n\"The Glory\" came in at No. 1 on the list of trending TV shows in South Korea. \"Moving\" (Disney+), \"Mask Girl\" (Netflix), \"Casino\" (Disney+), and \"Revenant\" (SBS) rounded out the top 5 in the country.\n\nTyphoon Khanun, which rocked the country a little more than a week into August of this year, was the top trending local news search in Korea. Jeon Cheong-jo, the former fianc\u00e9 of fencing pro Nam Hyun-hee who was alleged to have defrauded people of billions of won, was second on the list. \"Superconductors\" came in third after a group of Korean researchers claimed to have synthesized a room-temperature, ambient-pressure superconductor.\n\nThe No. 4 news story on the list was the sudden passing of Astro member Moonbin, who died on April 19. No. 5 was the stabbing rampage at Sillim Station that took place in July.\n\nAfter war erupted between Israel and Hamas, \"War in Israel and Gaza\" reached the top of the trending international news list for the year. After that, Koreans searched for X (formerly Twitter), OpenAI, the earthquake in T\u00fcrkiye and Bondee.",

In actual dark forests, hunter-gatherers would often attack strangers they encountered. And in old Oceania, island groups would sometimes invade and massacre other island groups. This was often done out of fear of attack and/or desire for resources, as Liu postulates. And of course there are plenty of historical examples from the colonization of the Americas and Oceania, as well as steppe nomad imperialism.\n\nBut overall, relations between terrestrial nations and peoples are usually very non-genocidal.\n\nTrade and cultural exchange are the norm in the modern day.\n\nThis is not because strong nations lack the power to wipe out weak ones -- it would be easy for Russia or China or the U.S. to annihilate Kyrgyzstan or Mongolia or Honduras, especially if we made an agreement that we'd all be better off destroying those smaller countries before they can grow big or advanced enough to threaten us.\n\nOne very important reason we don't do this is partly because it would rightly be seen both within and outside of the attacking nation(s) as a terrible crime, increasing unrest and international hostility. But it's also partly because we have more to gain by trading with smaller countries than by annihilating them.\"\n\nhttps://www.noahpinion.blog/p/the-dark-forest-hypothesis-is-absurd\n\nWealthy activists like George Soros, for example, fund the political campaigns of 'progressive prosecutors' who release criminals onto the streets and refuse to prosecute crimes.\n\nCombined with the geniuses in many city councils across the country who have de-funded their police departments and decriminalized shoplifting, the unsurprising result has been an alarming rise in crime.\n\nMeanwhile, the people running the federal government roll out the red carpet for illegal migrants at the southern border, creating total chaos in most major cities.\n\nThey constantly issue idiotic regulations and legislation which make life more cumbersome and expensive for average Americans and small businesses- like the Labor Department's recent 800-page proposal to make sure that interns can use a toilet which conforms to their gender identity.\n\nEnemies are at the gate. And in some instances, including through repeated cyberattacks and other incursions, enemies have already breached the gate.\n\nYet the people in charge have weakened the military between their vaccine mandates, the humiliation of Afghanistan, and endless diversity & inclusion efforts. Recruiting and mission readiness are now both at historic lows.\n\nThey weaponize the justice system against their opponents and soften it for their friends and family. Rule of law has become a total joke, especially now that even high-ranking judges have become social activists whose rulings reflect their woke fanaticism rather than Constitutional law.\n\nThey suppress intellectual dissent and denounce those who disagree with them as \"cave men\", \"white supremacists\", \"threats to democracy\", or \"science deniers\". And their propaganda machine masquerading as mainstream journalism constantly feeds us these lies with a straight face.\n\nThey refuse to even acknowledge the looming fiscal crises they've engineered through decades of deficit spending and expensive entitlement programs. The country is only a few years from a financial cliff, yet they're not even talking about it.\n\nAnd to top it all off, the guy in charge appears to have lost his mind... just like King George III.\n\nThese are the circumstances of America today. And in many respects, they are similar to Britain in the early 1800s.\n\nCould there be a similar, miraculous turnaround for the US?

And I am not being hyperbolic here, I have heard stories from friends in legacy sectors whose teams have started location-tracking employees during the day. It's straight out of a dystopian panopticon science fiction novel. I can't imagine anyone competent staying at such firms very long.\n\nAbsolute top companies like like NVIDIA worth well >$1 trillion are running remote operations for their teams, so there's really no excuse that \"this is just for smaller shops.\"\n\nhttps://www.hottakes.space/p/remote-work-won-dont-let-anyone-gaslight\n\nAt some point Ukraine needs to persuade the Kremlin that the only hope of restoring equanimity to the relationship is for Russian troops to be withdrawn from Ukrainian territory. Meanwhile it is deeply unsatisfactory to be in a position where Ukraine can only mark time, and take the pain, waiting for more favourable turn in US politics - and to have devise new strategies in case it never does.\"\n\nhttps://samf.substack.com/p/ukraine-through-the-gloom\n\n\"The United States has relied almost entirely on China -- and to a lesser extent Russia -- in recent years to procure a critical mineral that is vital to producing ammunition.\n\nThe mineral antimony is critical to the defense-industrial supply chain and is needed to produce everything from armor-piercing bullets and explosives to nuclear weapons as well as sundry other military equipment, such as night vision goggles.\n\nAfter Japan cut off the U.S. supply of antimony from China during World War II, the United States began procuring the mineral from ore in an Idaho goldmine. However, that mine ceased production in 1997.\n\n\"There is no domestic mine for antimony,\" according to a 2020 report from the U.S. Geological Survey, a government agency. \"China is the largest producer of mined and refined antimony and a major source of imports for the United States.\"\n\nhttps://www.defensenews.com/congress/budget/2022/06/08/the-us-is-heavily-reliant-on-china-and-russia-for-its-ammo-supply-chain-congress-wants-to-fix-that/\n\n\"But I also believe that there will be a crop of new companies that challenge incumbents head-on and win, capturing large markets at high margins in the process. I've started calling them Techno-Industrials.\n\nTechno-Industrials use technology to build atoms-based products with structurally superior unit economics with the ultimate goal of winning on cost in large existing markets, or expanding or creating new markets where there is pent-up demand.\n\nThey can leverage their structurally superior unit economics in the form of lower prices to win market share, higher gross margins, or both.\n\nLess fancily, they'll use new technology, processes, or approaches to make physical things that customers want more cheaply than existing companies can, in a way that existing companies can't match. Because they can manufacture more cheaply, they can either lower their prices to steal market share from incumbents or capture more gross margin. In some cases, they'll have enough room to do both.\n\nThe category alternately called hard tech / deep tech / frontier tech / atoms-based / American Dynamism is on fire. The things that these companies are able to do and build boggle the mind.\n\nIt takes a new, old way of thinking about tech companies to understand which might break through to become very large standable businesses, and this is my first entry in what I suspect will be an ongoing attempt to put a framework around it.\n\nWhile software has been all about swamping upfront fixed costs with high gross margins as revenue grows, I think the defining characteristic of successful Techno-Industrials will be whether they have a structural cost advantage.\n\nThat might come from an in-house invention or the integration of a number of new capabilities in novel and defensible ways. In either case, if Techno-Industrials are to succeed, it will be because they leverage technology to do what technology is supposed to do: give people more and better for less.\n\nWe covered three examples - Anduril, Solugen, and Monumental Labs - taking three different approaches towards that end. Beautifully, there is no playbook written yet, and I suspect each Techno-Industrial will forge a different path.\"\n\nhttps://www.notboring.co/p/the-techno-industrial-revolution\n\nMost of the young Chinese I chatted with are in their early 20s. Visitors to Thailand are trying to catch up on the fun they lost under three years of zero-Covid. Those who have made Chiang Mai their new home have complex reasons for staying. They told me that they've felt a quiet shattering of their worldview over the past few years.\n\nThese are youths who grew up in bigger cities and attended good universities, endowing them with certain expectations: that they could pursue meaningful careers, that society would gain greater political freedoms, and that China would become more integrated with the rest of the world. These hopes have curdled. Their jobs are either too stressful or too menial, political restrictions on free expression have ramped up over the last decade, and China's popularity has plunged in developed countries.\n\nSo they've r\u00f9n. One trigger for departure were the white-paper protests, the multi-city demonstrations at the end of 2022 in which young people not only demanded an end to zero-Covid, but also political reform. Several of the Chiang Mai residents participated in the protests in Shanghai or Beijing or they have friends who had been arrested. Nearly everyone feels alienated by the pressures of modern China. A few lost their jobs in Beijing's crackdown on online tutoring. Several have worked in domestic Chinese media, seriously disgruntled that the censors make it difficult to publish ambitious stories.\n\nPeople complain of being treated like chess pieces by top leader Xi Jinping, who is exhorting the men to work for national greatness and for the women to bear their children.\n\nThis middle class, however, is feeling less sure these days, as the economy keeps getting whacked. The trouble with Xi Jinping is that he is 60 percent correct on all the problems he sees, while his government's brute force solutions reliably worsen thing. Are housing developers taking on too much debt? Yes, but driving many of them to default and triggering a collapse in the confidence of homebuyers hasn't improved matters. Does big tech have too much power? Fine, but taking the scalps of entrepreneurs and stomping out their businesses isn't boosting confidence. Does the government need to rein in official corruption? Definitely, but terrorizing the bureaucracy has also made the policymaking apparatus more paralyzed and risk averse. It's starting to feel like the only thing scarier than China's problems are Beijing's solutions.\"\n\nThese won't just be the run of the mill religions and cults either. They're going to become stranger. Social media has created self perpetuating loops of content and reinforcement that will radicalize more and more individuals to more radical and ridiculous ideas. Flat Earthers, Wiccans and the Hippies of yesteryear will be tame compared to what is coming.\"\n\nhttps://mercurial.substack.com/p/world-business-outlook-2024\n\nIn the email to staff, seen by The Information, co-CEO Pedro Franceschi acknowledged that \"we grew our org too quickly, making it harder to move at the speed we once did.\" He said Brex management \"decided to take a hard look at our current structure, and reduce the number of layers between leaders and the actual work that affects customers.\"\n\nBrex, which issues credit cards and manages cash for businesses, was burning an average of about $17 million a month in cash in the fourth quarter, The Information reported earlier Tuesday, based on data given to employees at an all-hands meeting earlier this month.\"\n\nhttps://www.theinformation.com/articles/brex-cuts-20-of-staff-and-shakes-up-senior-management\n\nDue to weather and geopolitics, higher shipping costs could cause a surge in inflation in the third and fourth quarter of this year. As Powell is undoubtedly aware of these issues, he will do everything he can to talk a big game about rate cuts without having to actually cut them. What might be a mild increase in the rate of inflation due to increased shipping costs could be supercharged by rate cuts and the resumption of QE. The market doesn't appreciate this fact yet, but Bitcoin does.\n\nThe only thing that trumps fighting inflation is a financial crisis. That is why, to get the cuts, QT taper, and the possible resumption of QE the market believes is already in the bag come March, we first need a few banks to fail when the BTFP is not renewed.\n\nTactical Trading\n\nA 30% correction from the ETF approval high of $48,000 is $33,600. Therefore, I believe Bitcoin forms support between $30,0000 to $35,000.\"\n\nhttps://cryptohayes.substack.com/p/yellen-or-talkin\n\nhttps://davidcummings.org/2024/01/27/unrealistic-goals-can-hurt-startup-morale/\n\n--If the US diminishes the ICJ and international rule of law, as it is currently doing to protect Israel, it will damage the system and its moral standing globally. It will also, due to the networked-enabled shift underway in younger demographics (55% of Americans between 18-29 believe that Israel is committing genocide), deeply damage its legitimacy (this loss in legitimacy is similar to what happened on the networked right with WMDs, the financial crisis, and the COVID response). Losses in legitimacy create distrust in politics, government institutions, and loyalty to the nation (which impacts everything from military service to siding with it in disputes with tribal identities).\n\n--This loss will come on the heels of other significant moral losses suffered over the last few years. For example, the withdrawal from Afghanistan, which became an evacuation, generated distrust in its military competence. In turn, the war in Ukraine demonstrated a selfish desire to sacrifice Ukraine to damage Russia and its unreliability as an ally when it slowed support for the war.\n\n--Combined, the rapid diminishment of the \"international rule of law\" and US moral standing, both cornerstones of Pax Americana, has set the stage for global chaos as the myriad tensions, hatreds, and ambitions that were dampened by this system are unleashed -- from opportunistic Houthi style drone blockades (in part enabled by those opposed to the US system) to major nation-states taking advantage of the chaos to realize long term ambitions (Taiwan)\"\n\nhttps://johnrobb.substack.com/p/losing-the-moral-war\n\nGoldstein pointed out that even as new conflicts have emerged in Ukraine, Gaza, and elsewhere, a number of long-running wars have also come to an end. The US withdrew from Afghanistan, ending a two-decade war, in 2021. The conflict in Syria has gone from a raging inferno to a low boil, as the Bashar al-Assad regime has consolidated control over much of the country and has normalized relations with many of the regional powers that were backing armed efforts to overthrow him just a few years ago.\n\nAn uneasy ceasefire has been held in Yemen for the last two years, a welcome respite in a conflict that has directly killed more than 150,000 as well as far more through disease and malnutrition, although it remains to be seen how long that can last given the Houthis' recent activities and the international coalition assembled to stop them.\n\nNone of the outcomes of these wars are particularly welcome for the United States -- or for most of the people in those countries, given which groups and authoritarians ended up in power -- but they do show that seemingly intractable conflicts can end even as new ones emerge.\"\n\nhttps://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/1/25/24049551/war-increasing-ukraine-gaza-sudan-ethiopia\n\nWhat Taiwan needs is more practical help -- anti-ship missiles, military training, coordination with allies, better cyberdefenses. Meanwhile, the United States needs to boost the capacity of industry to produce munitions rapidly in a crisis.\n\nThe Biden administration has worked very effectively with Japan, South Korea, Australia and the Philippines to prepare for joint action to constrain China. That enhances deterrence. Washington could also do more to help Taiwan cultivate cyberwarfare: If the grid goes out in Taipei, Shanghai should lose power, too. If Taipei's internet cables are cut, then China's great firewall should cave so ordinary Chinese are able to read about their leaders' corruption.\n\nMaybe the best recommendation I heard came from Mark Liu, the chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. He offered this useful advice for Americans aiming to help Taiwan's security: \"Do more. Talk less.\"\n\nThat advice might have helped the major powers in August 1914 avoid a cataclysmic and unnecessary war. It remains sound counsel today.\"\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/27/opinion/china-taiwan-war.html\n\nThe game of hope: outwit death by betting on science. Let the protocols of longevity and Dr. Andrew Huberman become the saviors of your wilting avatar. The sci-fi series Altered Carbon plays with this idea: people switch between bodies like suits and those who can afford it can practically live forever. Not only can they compound their wealth forever, but their children plot to murder them because immortality ruins the natural rhythm of succession.\n\nThe game of distraction: go all in on hedonism, consumption, and status games. Buy another boat, throw a bigger party in an even bigger house. Escape the haunting inevitable until you slip away in your sleep -- hopefully before waking up to the hangover of a meaningless nightmare.\n\nA special case of distraction is the game of more, also known as 'number go up'. Almost by definition, the self-made wealthy are very good at this (leaving aside the merely lucky). And even though the marginal value of earning another dollar declines to zero, the game remains an interesting distraction. It doesn't fill the void and occasionally might feel like an addiction. But it's still better than contemplating death. Might as well keep playing.\n\nFinally, there are secular games of legacy like children, charity, and teaching.\"\n\nhttps://alchemy.substack.com/p/in-search-of-ozymandias\n\nDefinitely agree with their perspective as startup investors and being bullish on India and Internet values.\n\nAs apps predicated on smaller use cases gain traction and start to scale, they can actually erode their core value proposition of intimacy, creating an opportunity for still-newer newcomers to take their place. Furthermore, the novelty of a new, narrow social experience quickly wears off before the app can iterate and expand, making it difficult to compete against incumbents that offer many more options and formats for social interaction.\n\nIn light of this, I sense that an alternative path to success in the realm of consumer apps lies beyond the well-worn model of building a \"kitchen sink\" social giant. An alternative, less obvious, and likely more fun route is to create a series of smaller, transient hits. Rather than building something that can one day scale to a billion users, the goal is to launch a series of quick-hit apps that capture attention fleetingly.\n\nFor founders, the benefit of following the venture studio strategy means more optionality than betting on one idea from the get-go. Creating a succession of apps still leaves open the option of building a big consumer app: if one of the bets takes off, the founder has the freedom to run with it. Beyond that, it's a structure that can also offer more autonomy and creativity. Since the goal isn't to build a monolithic giant that has mass appeal, each of the ideas can be more offbeat, interesting, and niche.\n\nIn a landscape now dominated by scaled incumbents, a viable alternate route for consumer builders is to embrace the dynamics of fleeting attention, build for transience and niche use cases, and -- uniquely enabled by crypto -- deploy tokens for cross-promotion and growth.\"\n\nThese are broad generalizations, but I mention them only in contrast to Japanese publishers, which appear to have a more favorable path to growth in 2024. Japan features a number of companies well-positioned for a strong year ahead, and has been more welcoming to web3 and AI. Should we see an unexpected breakout driven by these technologies, Japanese publishers may be best positioned to take advantage of them.\"",

        "title": "Trinis join global peace mission in India - Trinidad and Tobago Newsday",
        "text": "Concerned by the state of the world, eight Trinidadians joined over 10,000 people in India to try to bring about a decrease in the level of conflict around the world.\n\nFrom December 29, 2023-January 13, over 10,000 people gathered at Kanha Shanti Vanam outside of Hyderabad, India for the 10,000 for World Peace Assembly, organised by the Global Union of Scientists for Peace (GUSP).\n\nThe aim was to demonstrate what the followers of the late Maharishi Mahesh Yogi called \"the proven consciousness-based approach to creating world peace.\"\n\nThe idea is, that if the square root of one per cent of the population, about 9,000 people, practised Transcendental Meditation (TM) and TM-Sidhi programmes twice a day consistently, it would create \"the field effect of consciousness\" throughout the world.\n\nThe Global Union of Scientists for Peace website called it the Brain-Based Approach to Peace. It said there had been over 50 demonstrations and 28 scientific studies over the years which proved the approach would prevent social violence, terrorism, and war.\n\nIt said, \"This research has been carefully scrutinised by independent scholars and accepted for publication in leading peer-reviewed academic journals. In every case, this approach produced marked reductions of crime, social violence, terrorism, and war, and increased peace and positivity in society.\"\n\nCertified TM teachers Shelley Hosein and Anthony Grell were two of the people representing TT at the assembly in India.\n\nHosein said previously, when the Maharishi was alive when there were \"disturbances\" in countries, he would send or arrange for groups to do meditation and the advanced TM-Sidhi programme in or near those countries.\n\n\"Of course, the individuals always feel the deeper peace and happiness but, it had the effect of reducing crime, reducing hospital admissions and a few other negative trends, and when things settled a bit people would leave.\"\n\nGrell added that such mass meditations were done in 1983 in Israel during the Lebanon war and in Washington, DC in 1993.\n\nAccording to the Global Union of Scientists for Peace, over a two-year period during the Lebanon war, there were seven sessions in Israel; Utopia, US; Lebanon; Yugoslavia; Fairfield, US; Netherlands and Washington, DC, US.\n\nIt said during those periods war-related fatalities and injuries decreased by 71 per cent and 68 per cent respectively, the level of conflict dropped by 48 per cent and co-operation among antagonists increased by 66 per cent.\n\nIn the 1993 Washington experiment, measured by FBI Uniform Crime Statistics, it said soon after the study started, violent crime began to decrease, up to 23.3 per cent. And the rate stayed at those lower levels until the end of the experiment.\n\nHosein said, \"Based on that and the state of the world, I think that is what really motivated Dr Tony Nader (chairman of the GUSP, physician and neuroscientist) to say, 'We have a technology. It's been scientifically proven over many years, why not let's do a gathering so that more people will become interested and realise there is something that can be done for the individual and the world?'\"\n\nThe other aim was to motivate people to establish a permanent group of meditators there for the benefit of the world.\n\nShe said India was a natural choice as it is the land of the Veda, meditation was prevalent there and a large enough space to host so many people.\n\nOver 100 countries were represented at the event, including students who learned Yogic Flying in colleges throughout India.\n\nGrell said he wanted to be part of the memorable event, meditating and being around people who wanted the same things for the world. He said he knew the value of TM - increased productivity, increased spiritual connection, improved emotional regulation, mental clarity, stress reduction, relaxation, perspective, increased problem-solving ability and more - and, in a group, the effect was magnified.\n\nHosein described the group meditating experience as profound and expressed gratitude for being there as she would have never had that opportunity in TT. She said having people from all over the world, of different races, speaking different languages, from different religions, all unified in their purpose, felt like family and like something very valuable.\n\nShe recalled that their every need was taken care of and they did not have to worry about anything. There were tents for sleeping, meals, sim cards and minor health care were provided, and translation services for 30 languages. There were also book and clothes shops, a grocery, a laundry and other amenities. They were even provided with chairs, foam mats and cushions with backrests for meditating.\n\nEvery day for two weeks they would wake up, shower, meditate, have breakfast, attend inspirational or motivational talks and workshops by representatives of different spiritual organisations, have lunch, attend more talks or socialise, meditate, have dinner and then go to bed.\n\nFor meditation sessions, men were in the central area with the women in several wings or halls off the main area in smaller groups. People could walk around the central area while the women had more privacy.\n\nShe said even after decades of practising TM, she gained a deeper experience of self and more experience with inner silence.\n\nThere were live demonstrations where\n\nEEG (electroencephalogram), which measured electrical activity in the brain, leads were attached to meditators and everyone saw the changes in their brain signals shift from erratic to calm before meditating to deep meditation.\n\n\"It enhanced my strong belief that it is possible to change the world, there is a way and it doesn't have to be with more guns. More of that type of thing that does not help and it even depletes the society. We lose so many people in war. How could that be the answer?\"\n\n\"People have to start thinking outside the box, and recognise that each individual has the ability to change themselves and then have that effect on the rest of the room.\"\n\nGrell agreed saying people project their energy and the type of energy depends on how they are feeling. In such a large group, the benefits of TM - increased clarity of mind, harmony, tolerance and patience as well as feelings of happiness and peace - were amplified and sent outward.\n\n\"If you can actually prevent or remove enmity, take away that energy, it means the people will not want to go to war, sending young people to war to die, and they will not want to destroy.\"\n\nHe said when people were living in a constant state of stress, anger and fear, they radiate that into their environment thereby affecting others. Also, under chronic stress, people react before they think or do not think clearly, increasing negative behaviours like road rage, school violence and domestic violence.\n\nAccording to the US National Library of Medicine, stress could cause an imbalance of neural circuitry instrumental in promoting cognition, decision-making, anxiety and mood that affect behaviours and behavioural states.\n\nGrell said if a person wanted peace, they had to go to where peace resided, in that inner aspect or consciousness. He noted that the bible said the kingdom of heaven is within you and, many other religions had similar sentiments. TM was a technique that allowed people to experience that inner aspect, leading to spiritual development.\n\nHe compared the multiplying effect of group meditation to a population getting vaccinated. If a certain percentage of the population was vaccinated against a disease it would protect those who did not or could not get vaccinated.\n\nIn the cause of gaining peace through meditation, at least the square root of one per cent of the population, which would be around 300 people in the case of TT, needed to practise TM consistently as stress came constantly from different avenues.\n\nHosein said they all knew the effect would not happen overnight and scientists were already gathering the data and doing research on the effect of the 10,000 for World Peace Assembly.",

        "text": "In March 2022, Grifols (Spain) received European approvals for XEMBIFY, a 20% subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG)\n\nAccording to a research report \"Plasma Fractionation Market size is projected to reach USD 40.4 billion by 2028 from USD 29.0 billion in 2023, at a CAGR of 6.9% during the forecast period. The growing popularity of immunoglobulins for the treatment of various therapeutic areas such as hematology, neurology, and pulmonology, as well as the use of protease inhibitors for the treatment of lung and hepatic disorders with rising incidence rates, are driving the growth of the market.\n\nHowever, the rising cost of plasma-derived products, limited reimbursements, and the rise of recombinant alternatives are projected to hamper the market's growth during the forecast period.\n\nDownload Report Brochure @www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdown..._id=PaidPR\n\nKey Market Player:\n\nThe global plasma fractionation market is highly consolidated. The prominent players operating in this market include CSL (Australia), Takeda Pharmaceutical company limited (Japan), Grifols, S.A.\n\n(Spain), Octapharma AG (Switzerland), Kedrion S.P.A (Italy), LFB (France), ADMA Biologics (US), Sanquin (Netherlands), China Biologic Products Holdings Inc. (China), GC Pharma (Korea), Haualan Bioengineering Co., Ltd.\n\n(China), Japan Blood Products Organization (Japan), Emergent BioSolutions (US), Shanghai Raas Blood Products Co., Ltd. (China), Intas Pharmaceuticals Ltd.\n\n(India), Bharat Serum Vaccines Limited (India), SK Plasma (Korea), Sichuan Yuanda Shuyang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (China), Kamada (Israel), Centurion Pharma (Istanbul), Prothya Biosolutions (Netherlands), PlasmaGen BioSciences Pvt.\n\nLtd. (India), Virchow Biotech Private Limited (India), Fusion Healthcare (India), and Hemarus Therapeutics Limited (India).\n\nGeographic expansions and collaborations are the key growth strategies undertaken by these companies to maintain their positions in the market.\n\nDRIVER: Growing prevalence of respiratory diseases and AATD\n\nIn recent years, the use of protease inhibitors such as alpha-1-antitrypsin has increased significantly for the treatment of lung diseases (such as emphysema) and hepatic diseases (such as hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis). Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a chronic, unrecognized metabolic genetic disorder.\n\nIt is responsible for 2&ndash;3% of emphysema cases in the US. The deficiency of alpha-1-antitrypsin leads to the early onset of pan-lobular emphysema in both smokers and non-smokers, and the abnormal accumulation of alpha-1-antitrypsin in the liver leads to liver diseases.\n\nAATD occurs worldwide, but its prevalence varies by geography. Emphysema, along with chronic bronchitis, is collectively known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nSevere AATD is associated with a significant number of cases of COPD. According to a publication by Elsevier B.V.\n\nin July 2023, an estimated worldwide prevalence of the PI*ZZ Alpha-1 Antitrypsin genotype in subjects with COPD was around 50% in Europe, 37% in America, 9% in Asia, 3% in Australasia, and 1% in Africa. The estimated crude prevalence of COPD in adults older than 40 years was 13.51% in America, 12.45% in Europe, 13.22% in Africa, 11.70% in Asia, and 11.86% in Australasia.\n\nPrevalence was significantly higher, especially in Europe, the USA, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia, while it was found to be lower, especially in regions of Asia and Africa.\n\nThe growing prevalence of AATD and emphysema and improvements in diagnostic techniques such as CT scanning are expected to increase the number of people undergoing therapies for these diseases. This, in turn, will lead to a greater demand for protease inhibitors such as alpha-1-antitrypsin and contribute to the overall growth of the plasma fractionation market.\n\nRESTRAINT: Market disruption caused by recombinant alternatives\n\nRecent approvals for recombinant factors such as AFSTYLA (CSL), VONVENDI (Takeda/Shire), and Kovaltry (Bayer) are expected to offer lucrative opportunities for companies operating in this market space. At present, two different classes of recombinant factor products are available standard half-life products and extended half-life products.\n\nThe former class of recombinant factors last in the body for the same amount of time as the natural factor VIII or factor IX. Whereas extended half-life products are modified to last longer in the body than standard half-life products.\n\nIn developed countries, recombinant factors VIII and IX have already gained traction as alternatives to plasma-derived factors VIII and IX in bleeding disorders, as reported by the Annual Global Survey conducted by the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) in 2020. On the other hand, the use of recombinant factors has also increased in countries such as Brazil, India, and Russia.\n\nThis trend is expected to impose certain limitations on the expansion of plasma-derived coagulation factors, thereby affecting the overall market growth.\n\nRequest Sample Report: www.marketsandmarkets.com/request...d=93798284\n\nThe immunoglobins segment accounted for the largest share by-product in the plasma fractionation market in 2022.\n\nBased on product, the plasma fractionation market is segmented into protease inhibitors, coagulation factor concentrates, immunoglobulins, albumins, and other products. Immunoglobulins accounted for the largest share of the global plasma fractionation market in 2022.\n\nThe dominance of this segment is mainly attributed to the rise in the cases of neurological and immunological diseases, the increase in off-label utilization of immunoglobulins, especially IVIg, and the increased usage of these immunoglobulins in the treatment of a variety of diseases and conditions that are linked to humoral immune deficiency or immune system dysfunction, including immune thrombocytopenic purpura, Kawasaki syndrome, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and graft-versus-host diseases after bone marrow transplantation.\n\nThe pulmonology segment is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period.\n\nBased on application, the plasma fractionation market is segmented into pulmonology, hemato-oncology neurology, immunology, hematology, critical care, rheumatology, and other applications. In 2022, the pulmonology segment is expected to register the highest CAGR during the forecast period.\n\nThe increasing demand for immunoglobulins to prevent and treat upper and lower respiratory tract infections due to their efficiency is a major factor driving growth in this market segment. Additionally, the use of protease inhibitors such as alpha-1-antitrypsin has also increased substantially over the past few years.\n\nNorth America was the largest regional market for plasma fractionation market in 2022\n\nThe global plasma fractionation market is segmented into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East and Africa. In 2022, North America accounted for the largest share of the plasma fractionation market, followed by Europe and the Asia Pacific.\n\nThe significant market share held by North America is supported by the region's rising hemophilic population as well as the rising demand for immunoglobulins for conditions like PID, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), allogenic bone marrow transplantation, pediatric HIV, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The market in Asia Pacific, on the other hand, is projected to grow at the greatest CAGR throughout the forecast period.\n\nThis can be attributed to the expansion of the healthcare sector, the increasing incidence of hemophilia, the increase in the number of organ transplants, the increased emphasis on early diagnosis and prophylactic care, the increased awareness of technologically advanced products, and the rising standards of living in many countries in APAC.\n\nRequest 10% Customization: www.marketsandmarkets.com/request...d=93798284\n\nRecent Development:\n\nIn April 2023, CSL (Australia) received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the 50mL/10gm prefilled syringe for Hizentra (Immune Globulin Subcutaneous [Human] 20% Liquid for patients suffering from PI and CIPD.

        "title": "India And Middle East: The Evolving Dynamics",
        "text": "India And Middle East: The Evolving Dynamics Sunday, February 25, 2024 by Indian Defence News\n\nLet multi-alignments, rather than a singular focus, be the basis of its policy recalibration\n\nIndia must remain nimble, constantly ready to respond to the escalating security concerns in the Middle East. However, this agility should not entail impulsive shifts in foreign policy or inconsistencies with its long-term objectives. The calibrated shift must consider the emergence of multiple regional powers, each supported by a cohort of allies from both within and outside the region. The emerging multipolar situation, with more than one global or regional power calling the shots and, at times, punching above its weight, will not, however, be without its own set of peculiarities and imponderables.\n\nWith Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Israel emerging as the new regional powers, the Western bloc, currently led by the US, will need to reassess its allies and adversaries. This re-evaluation will necessitate acknowledging both formal and less recognized entities, including armed local groups in the countries of West Asia. For a time, the West, particularly the US, may struggle with the realization that it no longer holds undisputed military and economic influence in the Middle East. The Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) member-nations such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Oman, besides Egypt, and the Palestinian National Authority are other critical players with whom India's ties have the potential of being strengthened. Each of these countries, individually as well as along with their neighbours, is capable of significantly influencing the regional dynamics.\n\nIndia's relationship with each of these eight countries, starting with Israel, the Palestinian National Authority, Iran, and Saudi Arabia is discussed in this piece, with the remainder to be covered in the next. The impact of the duality in India's policy viz. strengthening ties with both the Arab world and Israel -- will be a subject in both parts of this analysis. It is also important to explore issues critical to India, such as energy security, the large Indian diaspora in West Asia, the significant remittances they send back to their families in India, and the growing importance of Indian commercial interests in certain Middle Eastern countries.\n\nIsrael\n\nAfter a rather frosty relationship in the initial years following its creation in 1948, with India totally supporting the Arab nations and the Palestinians, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao in 1992 took the significant step of formally establishing diplomatic relations with Israel. Since then, India has increasingly warmed up to Israel in both economic and security matters. Today, it is India's second-largest supplier of arms and technology, and there is a noticeable bonhomie in their relationship. This perhaps influenced India's initial stance in siding with Israel in the early days of the ongoing conflict, following Hamas' firing of hundreds of missiles from Gaza and taking 250 Israeli civilians as hostages.\n\nFinding the subsequent Israeli retaliation disproportionately severe, and with the world community -- including its Western allies -- calling for restraint in attacks on civilian settlements, India has adopted a more nuanced and balanced approach to its support. Since then, while condemning Hamas for its indiscriminate initial attacks on Israeli territory, India has reasserted its historical support for the two-state solution regarding Palestine and supported the UN and other efforts to achieve both an interim and a lasting ceasefire, aiming to bring the warring sides to the negotiation table. India has also increased its naval operations against the Houthis and others engaging in acts of piracy, without joining the American and British military actions against the Houthis in the Red Sea. Such a calculated response must remain the hallmark of its policy, lest the decades of neutrality and careful balancing turn into wasted effort.\n\nFor India, Israel is not only a major supplier of sophisticated military hardware and systems but also an important source of assistance in agricultural technology, medical start-ups, and as an investor in Indian real estate. Indian tech companies find Israel's high-tech economy and culture of innovation suitable for investments. During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit in July 2017, agreements were signed to enhance collaboration in science, agriculture, defence, and to set up a $40 million technology innovation fund. There is now extensive co-operation in counterterrorism, intelligence sharing, homeland, and cyber security. This is happening at a time when Israel also maintains a close economic and defence relationship with China, which, according to Netanyahu, is mainly interested in its technology. Fortunately, in the overall favourable milieu of rapprochement with Israel building up among the Middle East nations, augmenting bilateral relations between Israel and India is no longer an issue of major concern. However, as India proceeds, it must invariably remain cognizant of not wavering from the path of extending political support to the cause of Palestine. Alongside, India needs to continue its growing efforts at building up bilateral relations with most of the Arab nations.\n\nNo doubt, Russia has now become India's favoured supplier of crude oil. Nonetheless, India's dependence on the Middle East for its huge and growing need for hydrocarbons is expected to remain significant in the decades ahead. The transition of the Indian energy sector to renewables and electric mobility is anticipated to be gradual. Much of India's crude refining capacity has been developed to process crude oil that meets Arabian specifications. Logistically, there is a clear advantage in terms of distance and proximity, especially for refineries located on the west coast of India.\n\nThere are 9.5 million Indian workers in the Gulf, and their annual remittances play a crucial role in replenishing India's foreign exchange reserves and maintaining the value of the Indian rupee. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows from the Middle East, particularly from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, seem highly promising. With Bilateral Investment Protection Agreements (BIPAs) being signed with these countries -- Prime Minister Modi oversaw the signing of one in the UAE last fortnight -- the anticipated equity inflows of $75 billion from the UAE, the $100 billion announced by Saudi Arabia in 2019, and $35 billion from Qatar should be possible.\n\nPalestinian National Authority\n\nEver since Prime Minister Nehru's time, India has extended total support to Palestine, a stance that has remained an article of faith for the country. This strong affirmation had, in fact, prevented India from establishing normal relations with Israel until 1992, when India initiated diplomatic relations with Israel. Until then, the Palestinian issue had been central to India's foreign policy in the Middle East and, to some extent, with the United States. However, the rapprochement between Israel and Egypt in 1979, with Jordan in 1994, and later, in 2020, the signing of formal normalization agreements with Gulf Arab states -- UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco (also known as the Abraham Accords) -- under President Trump's initiative, has seen the salience of Palestine in India's external affairs decline. The suspension by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu of plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank was viewed as a contribution to the Palestinian cause.\n\nNevertheless, the Palestinian leadership expressed disappointment at such recognitions by the Arab states. Its Foreign Minister, Riad Maliki, called it violative of the 2002 Saudi Arab Peace Initiative, which set two preconditions for such normalization: a full Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 lines and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. The failure of the Arab League to address the actions of the UAE and other member states had led to Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Fatah in the occupied West Bank co-operating in renewing the Palestinian unity talks.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority looks to India for its continued and steadfast support for the two-nation theory. India would do well to not move away from this stance. Its public endorsement, as demonstrated by President Pranab Mukherjee's visit to Palestine in 2015, Prime Minister Modi's visit in 2017, and the return visit the same year by President Mahmoud Abbas of Palestine , as well as the economic co-operation and financial assistance, must remain fully intact. India should surely lend a hand in the rebuilding of the war-ravaged Gaza once the ground situation permits.\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nSaudi Arabia has become India's fourth-largest trading partner with $28 bn in bilateral trade, though much of it is imported crude oil. Since establishing a formal mechanism in 2014 for defence cooperation, both countries have shared intelligence and counterterrorism efforts (targeting terrorists in Pakistan as well as radical Sunni groups in Syria that pose a threat to Saudi Arabia). In 2019, they signed another agreement for the procurement and joint production of military equipment, in addition to holding joint air and naval exercises. Following the Covid-19 pandemic years, these initiatives have been put into action.\n\nThe Saudis, fearing both the ideological stance and the emerging military strength of Iran -- especially its nuclear capabilities -- expect India to distance itself from Iran. This has hitherto been difficult to concede by India, given its traditional and extensive ties with Iran. However, this stance may soon need to be reconsidered. As if in anticipation of it, the Saudis have shown a shift in their position; they no longer explicitly side with Pakistan and did not criticise India in 2019 when it revoked the limited autonomy of Kashmir and introduced a new citizenship law, which allegedly discriminated against Muslims and stirred controversy. Despite its growing security-related and economic proximity with the US and rapid progress towards becoming a regional superpower, Saudi Arabia's friendly postures have aided India's rise in status in the Middle East. India must not let go of this route to elevation in position in the Arab World, though it warrants continued caution and careful balancing. To further cement its ties with this wealthy and influential centre of Islam, India may need to go the extra mile.\n\nIran\n\nAfter the revolution of 1979, which saw the deposition of its Shah and the orthodox Shia religious leadership come to power, Iran has survived decades of a wide range of Western economic and military sanctions, as well as growing isolation from its neighbours. In fact, by skilfully challenging the international order and forming unconventional alliances, it might have even thrived. Iran makes no secret of its perpetual state of conflict with the \"Satanic\" USA. A high degree of pragmatism in advancing its own interests has enabled it to achieve a degree of well-being without sacrificing its ideological objectives. This is evident in its relationship with India as well, which it recognises as gradually moving into the Western camp.\n\nIndia and Iran have had historical relations, both at the government level and through people-to-people connections. The Parsis migrated from Iran, and several Indian businessmen have roots there. However, due to the \"US factor,\" the relationship has not fully evolved. In 2019, US sanctions compelled India to cease its crude imports from Iran. Yet, Iran has allowed Indian goods to transit to Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Gulf. Allowing India to develop the Chabahar Port, the first terminal of which became operational in December 2017, located next to the border with Pakistan, would further facilitate Indian interests, besides possibly resuming Iranian oil imports. Upon being exempted from US sanctions, India is constructing a $1.6 billion rail link from Chabahar to Zahedan in the north. However, for various reasons, progress on this project has been tardy.\n\nGoing forward, India might face challenges given that China and Iran have a 25-year-long and $400 billion worth bilateral security and economic partnership. In 2020, Iran made adverse comments regarding India's revocation of Article 370 concerning Kashmir. Understandably, this prompted the Indian defence and foreign ministers to hastily visit Tehran to assuage their concerns and assure them of India's continued interest in strengthening bilateral ties. Yet, in the years ahead, there might be a dilution of these ties, largely due to shifts in both regional and global geopolitics.\n\nComments",

        "text": "\"Together, exports to these markets capture 5 per cent of India's total exports of 42 principal commodities to the world. These commodities span across 16 important sectors of India's export basket,\" the official added. (PTI)\n\nAt a time when global trade is facing geo-political uncertainties, India's exports of goods like automobiles and gold jewellery have ventured into uncharted territories of Central Asia, Africa and Latin America, according to an analysis by the commerce ministry.\n\nThe analysis has shown that India has penetrated into what are termed as \"absolutely new markets\" in regions such as Africa, Central Asia, Latin America and North America during April-December 2023.\n\nThe \"absolutely new markets\" refer to areas where India did see any export during April-December 2022, but healthy growth of certain principal commodities like motor vehicles, two- and three-wheelers, petroleum products, sugar, gold and other precious jewellery were recorded in April-December 2023.\n\nExports of these commodities to the absolutely new markets during April-December 2023 stood at USD 234 million as against nil shipments during the same period of 2022.\n\nIt added that these commodities captured a greater number of markets in the Central Asia, Africa, and European regions.\n\n\"A comprehensive examination of country-wise exports underscores a notable diversification of markets for India's merchandise exports, characterised by the exploration of new export destinations, in spite of strong global headwinds with subdued performance globally,\" an official said.\n\nThe official added that after evaluating the market diversification of the country's merchandise exports across major sectors at the principal commodity level, comparing the periods from April-December 2022-23 to April-December 2023-24, significant advancements in market diversification emerged in the current fiscal.\n\nThese diversified markets are termed as \"absolutely new\", \"new\", and \"promising\".\n\n\"Together, exports to these markets capture 5 per cent of India's total exports of 42 principal commodities to the world. These commodities span across 16 important sectors of India's export basket,\" the official added.\n\nIn the new markets, where India's exports share of goods like ceramics and allied products, aluminium, products of aluminium, two- and three-wheelers, products of iron and steel, electric machinery and equipments was meagre or nil has jumped to USD 2.17 billion during April-December 2023.\n\nThese items have captured a greater number of markets in the America, Central Asian, and African regions.\n\nThe analysis showed that the export of two- and three-wheelers has been headed to 31 new markets/countries with a total exported value of USD 110 million in the April-December 2023 period.\n\nSimilarly, in the \"promising markets\" such as North and South American, European, and African regions, where the share of the country's outbound shipments of these commodities was less than 1 per cent, has now increased to USD USD 8.6 billion during the first nine months period of this fiscal.\n\n\"Despite challenging global conditions, India has demonstrated notable export growth, maintaining its position in established markets while proactively exploring new ones,\" the official said.\n\nThis strategy not only reduces dependency on specific markets but also enhances India's competitiveness and contributes to economic development, the official added.\n\nIndia's exports rose to a three-month high of 3.12 per cent to USD 36.92 billion in January despite global uncertainties, including the Red Sea crisis, while the trade deficit narrowed to a nine-month low of USD 17.49 billion.\n\nCumulatively, exports during the April-January period of this fiscal dipped 4.89 per cent to USD 353.92 billion. Imports contracted 6.71 per cent to USD 561.12 billion, leaving a trade deficit of USD 207.2 billion in the 10-month period of this fiscal as against USD 229.37 billion in April-January 2022-23.\n\nThe Red Sea crisis is impacting exporters as it has pushed up transportation costs as they are taking a longer route -- via Cape of Good Hope, encircling Africa -- to ship their goods to Europe and certain parts of Africa. War in Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas too is impacting the global exports and imports.",

        "text": "At a time when global trade is facing geo-political uncertainties, India's exports of goods like automobiles and gold jewellery have ventured into uncharted territories of Central Asia, Africa and Latin America, according to an analysis by the commerce ministry. The analysis has shown that India has penetrated into what are termed as \"absolutely new markets\" in regions such as Africa, Central Asia, Latin America and North America during April-December 2023. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel The \"absolutely new markets\" refer to areas where India did see any export during April-December 2022, but healthy growth of certain principal commodities like motor vehicles, two- and three-wheelers, petroleum products, sugar, gold and other precious jewellery were recorded in April-December 2023. Exports of these commodities to the absolutely new markets during April-December 2023 stood at USD 234 million as against nil shipments during the same period of 2022. It added that these commodities captured a greater number of markets in the Central Asia, Africa, and European regions. \"A comprehensive examination of country-wise exports underscores a notable diversification of markets for India's merchandise exports, characterised by the exploration of new export destinations, in spite of strong global headwinds with subdued performance globally,\" an official said. The official added that after evaluating the market diversification of the country's merchandise exports across major sectors at the principal commodity level, comparing the periods from April-December 2022-23 to April-December 2023-24, significant advancements in market diversification emerged in the current fiscal. These diversified markets are termed as \"absolutely new\", \"new\", and \"promising\". \"Together, exports to these markets capture 5 per cent of India's total exports of 42 principal commodities to the world. These commodities span across 16 important sectors of India's export basket,\" the official added. In the new markets, where India's exports share of goods like ceramics and allied products, aluminium, products of aluminium, two- and three-wheelers, products of iron and steel, electric machinery and equipments was meagre or nil has jumped to USD 2.17 billion during April-December 2023. These items have captured a greater number of markets in the America, Central Asian, and African regions. The analysis showed that the export of two- and three-wheelers has been headed to 31 new markets/countries with a total exported value of USD 110 million in the April-December 2023 period. Similarly, in the \"promising markets\" such as North and South American, European, and African regions, where the share of the country's outbound shipments of these commodities was less than 1 per cent, has now increased to USD USD 8.6 billion during the first nine months period of this fiscal. \"Despite challenging global conditions, India has demonstrated notable export growth, maintaining its position in established markets while proactively exploring new ones,\" the official said. This strategy not only reduces dependency on specific markets but also enhances India's competitiveness and contributes to economic development, the official added. India's exports rose to a three-month high of 3.12 per cent to USD 36.92 billion in January despite global uncertainties, including the Red Sea crisis, while the trade deficit narrowed to a nine-month low of USD 17.49 billion. Cumulatively, exports during the April-January period of this fiscal dipped 4.89 per cent to USD 353.92 billion. Imports contracted 6.71 per cent to USD 561.12 billion, leaving a trade deficit of USD 207.2 billion in the 10-month period of this fiscal as against USD 229.37 billion in April-January 2022-23. The Red Sea crisis is impacting exporters as it has pushed up transportation costs as they are taking a longer route -- via Cape of Good Hope, encircling Africa -- to ship their goods to Europe and certain parts of Africa. War in Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas too is impacting the global exports and imports.",

        "title": "Israel Supporters Are Some Of The Worst People In The World",
        "text": "Listen to a reading of this article (reading by Tim Foley):\n\nYesterday I shared a tweet about how Doctors Without Borders are now encountering children as young as five in Gaza who say they want to die because of the horrific things they have experienced during Israel's ongoing genocidal onslaught.\n\nIt's just about the most awful thing you can imagine, tiny children being so traumatized that they consciously don't want to go on living. It boggles the mind to even contemplate it. But almost as soon as I shared my post, I got a response from an Israel supporter saying, \"Gazans support Hamas. Hamas conducts Islamic extremist terror. Gazans should reconsider their support for Hamas.\"\n\nLater I got another response from an account with a bunch of flag emojis next to its name saying, \"Before shedding tears for the people of Gaza, remember that they created Hamas, elected it, supported it, supplied it, worked for it, hid it, sheltered it, filled its ranks and celebrated all its atrocities.\"\n\nI received another response from an anonymous account saying \"FAFO\", an acronym for \"Fuck Around, Find Out\". Used here, it means that those small children who want to die because of the horrors they have experienced actually deserve it, because they are Gazan. Which is also essentially what the other two responders were saying as well.\n\nImagine being that way. Imagine being so warped and twisted inside that you think that's a sane and appropriate way to respond to unthinkable news about small children being so traumatized by mass military violence that they want to die.\n\nThis happens all the time. The other day I shared a report from an American doctor saying that IDF snipers have been picking off Gazan children with single shots to the head, and I again received a comment from someone saying \"Fuck around and find out.\"\n\nThey're essentially standing over a pile of child corpses and puffing their chests like a guy who just won a pub brawl.\n\nIt might seem kind of petty to focus on individual comments from random social media accounts, but this happens so often, and I see other people talking about it too\u200a -- \u200aI just saw a screenshot of a guy saying \"fuck around and find out\" in response to that gut-wrenching photo of a dead Palestinian girl ripped apart by an Israeli airstrike in Rafah earlier this month. So this is definitely a symptom of something profoundly ugly lurking in the underbelly of our society that's worth drawing some attention to.\n\nIf you don't interact with many Zionists in your day to day life or don't have a large enough profile to be constantly swarmed by Israel apologists you might be unaware that this is happening, but the vitriol I've been seeing from Israel supporters on social media platforms since October 7 has been one of the most shocking and disturbing things I've ever witnessed.\n\nEvery single day these last four and a half months I've been inundated with comments from Israel supporters excusing the most monstrous acts imaginable in the most monstrous ways imaginable. People calling for the total destruction of Gaza. People saying the Gazans deserve what is happening to them. Saying the sickest shit you can possibly think of in response to news of terrible things happening to innocent children.\n\nOver the years I've butted heads with pretty much every political faction in the English-speaking world at one point or another, and I can honestly say that Israel supporters are by far the absolute worst. No political faction I have ever interacted with is as immoral and dishonest, or so frequently says things that are so jaw-droppingly disgusting I am sure I must be misinterpreting it at first. I've never tangled with a more odious group of people.\n\nAnd to be clear I'm not talking about a faction of just Israelis or Jews here; a huge percentage of these awful comments come from Christian Zionists and American rightists, with a decent smattering of Hindu nationalists from India who'll support any excuse to cheerlead the killing of Muslims. The only unifying feature I'm seeing in the faction I'm talking about is that they support Israel and its actions in Gaza. What I'm saying here will be spun as antisemitic by Israel supporters no matter how I put it because Israel supporters are manipulative liars, but to be clear this is not about Jews at all.\n\nThere's something seriously, seriously wrong with these people. They have no interest in truth or morality; all they care about is supporting their favorite ethnostate and murdering Palestinians. I guess when you're already able to numb your heart and your mind enough to support an apartheid state that whose existence requires nonstop violence and abuse, when that state ramps up its atrocities to historic levels you're not going to have enough of a conscience to see anything wrong with it.\n\nAnyway that's my rant for today. Just had to get that out. I don't know what to do about any of this, but it's probably worth bringing some consciousness to.",

        "text": "I am writing this from the United States, where I attended an interesting solidarity meeting that I thought I should write about. It was interesting because it combined two struggles -- that for secularism in democratic India and against imperialism in occupied Palestine.\n\nHosted by the Boston South Asian Coalition it featured two speakers. One was our Teesta Setalvad, heroine of the struggle for justice in Gujarat. The other was a young man from South Lebanon named Saleem Hallal. In the audience were a few dozen people including several desis and to my mind this was what made this gathering especially interesting and I will write about why that is later.\n\nThe talks by the two speakers were focussed on the facts. About communal crimes in one place condoned by the State (some would say encouraged by it) and in the other a national struggle for the liberation. There was also a common thread and that was historical revisionism and the rewriting of things. The idea in both Palestine and 'New India' that something else used to be here on the ground and in this land a thousand years ago or two thousand years ago. And that idea and that notion therefore justifies violence against people and against structures and monuments in the present. A lot of people in the audience including myself found themselves nodding at the parallels. Setalvad, who has been a friend for a few decades, was precise and deliberate in what she communicated to the gathering, most of whom may not have known of what had transpired in and after 2002 in Gujarat. She spoke of the 174 individuals who had been convicted because of the courage and persistence of the survivors and activists. Of these 124 were given life.\n\nThese were convictions that came often in the face of resistance from the State to the idea of justice. To understand what sort of effort that took, consider only how rapist-murderer convicts are today mollycoddled by the government in India which wants to release them for no reason other than bigotry. Many might not know now and many who knew will have forgotten that the Supreme Court had moved trials out of Gujarat, something that to the best of my knowledge has not happened since or before.\n\nHallal spoke directly and with passion about how unjust was both the reality on the ground and the falsity of the narrative constructed to sustain it. That early settlers into Israel survived because of the aid of Palestinians he said, just as the early settlers into America had. What was happening in Palestine was not a religious conflict but one of the occupied against the occupier. He exposed how hollow it was to describe the settler colonialism as the coming together of a \"land without people for a people without a land.\" He explained how the narrative that the Israel Palestine issue was \"complicated\" was merely something used to complicate a more simple reality. That of occupation and colonialism and the rewriting history with a particular agenda. The talk is on the Boston South Asian Coalition YouTube page and I would encourage all to see it.\n\nWhy I said I found this gathering interesting was that it is not uncommon for Indian groups in the US to be shown as backing the government in India. Particularly on such issues as what the government does to minority Indians and in events that are organised by the State ('Howdy'). This is especially and unfortunately true of my own Gujarati community, who are often shown as being at the forefront of this defence of State communalism. But there is another side to this and there are other Indians, many of them, who are opposed to the path we have taken in recent years. It is those who I joined on that day.\n\nAt the gathering I spoke briefly on what it was that Indians abroad could do. This was that they should use the democratic process in their country to engage with what was happening in India. The main reason that a discriminatory citizenship law was passed in India in 2019 but not implemented yet was the protest against it. But another reason was the condemnatory position taken against it by the European Parliament. One wonders why it was that MPs in far off lands would be interested in what we might think of as being as our \"internal affairs\" but it is clear that this was likely because Indians abroad were concerned enough to raise the law with their local legislator. India is a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. There is no reason why our friends cannot remind us of this fact. And this in turn is more likely to happen if desis abroad engage more robustly with what is going on in India.\n\nSolidarity is important not only because as humans we should understand the suffering of others but because such participation is our duty. The Constitution's Preamble says that we Indians have resolved to secure for Indians \"fraternity, assuring the dignity of the individual.\" Fraternity can come only when we stand up for each other. The desis of the Boston South Asian Coalition actually attempt to do that.",

        "text": "Ahead of the 13th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC13) to be held in Abu Dhabi from 26th to 29th February 2024 in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, India has articulated its intent to take up the carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) at the Ministerial and to try to ensure that the guiding principles of WTO are maintained at the WTO MC13. India's stand categorically put forth by Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal, comes in the wake of attempts to include issues in the WTO that are not part of world trade. This edition of the WTO MC13 also comes amidst global economic slowdown and turbulence aggravated by the continuing war in Ukraine, Israel-Hamas conflict and violence wrought by non-state actors in the Red Sea, all of which have made global trade vulnerable.\n\nNew Delhi has always maintained that the WTO is important for a fair and robust multilateral trading system, even as it pushes for making the organisation stronger with necessary reforms, amidst concern over the CBAM issue and tax imposition of the European Union. At meetings of the Committee on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) on 6 to 10 November, 2023, India raised concern regarding a recent EU regulation which sets conditions for placing products potentially associated with deforestation and forest degradation on the EU market, or before exporting products from the EU market. India's top priorities for the MC13 also include securing a permanent solution for its public stockholding programme which seeks flexibility in food procurement and pricing, crucial for India's food security needs, according to an insight by the Global Trade Research Initiative.\n\nThe PSH programme is a policy tool under which the government procures crops like rice and wheat from farmers at minimum support price (MSP) and stores and distributes foodgrains to the poor. India also offers affordable rice and wheat to more than 800 million people, under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, making it the biggest of its kind. Food procurement, stockholding, and distribution are crucial to India's food security strategy and India's has argued that finding a solution to PSH was a long-standing WTO mandate and should be prioritized at MC13. According to Ajay Srivastava, founder GTRI, India may look for treating PSH programmes as \"Green Box\" support, exempt from reduction commitments. This would provide legal assurance for implementing PSH programmes without breaching WTO limits on domestic support. Another target may be freedom to set minimum prices and procurement levels based on India's food security needs. This includes avoiding limitations based on a fixed percentage of production value or reference prices based on outdated data.\n\nAccording to a communi",

        "text": "In a slightly spicy mood, garlic prices are at their peak these days. Soon its price in the market reached Rs 800 per kg. A Satvik avoids garlic in Indian cuisine for fear of altering the taste because it makes the food tamasic. But just think and see what are the reasons that garlic does not even cross the threshold of the kitchen of some houses, but the world is so crazy about its medicinal properties and taste that there is more demand for it than for its produce. The headlines say that garlic prices are not going to drop anytime soon.\n\nToday is 'Sunday of free time', some delicious dish will surely be prepared in the kitchen. The properties of garlic that enrich the taste of vegetables should not be ignored. So check out the graphic for tips on how to keep garlic safe year-round, so that when prices rise, your garlic in the kitchen will keep your plate flavoring without breaking the bank.\n\nHumans have been enjoying the taste of garlic for seven thousand years\n\nBy the way, people of the Sumerian civilization began to grow garlic on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea 5 thousand years ago. Garlic is said to have come from the eastern lowlands of the Caspian Sea. But it has been used as a medicinal plant for 7 thousand years. Garlic is one of the first crops that man began to cultivate.\n\nGarlic cultivation in India came from Central Asia thousands of years ago. The pages of history show that garlic has been in use in India for 4500 years. In India, garlic seeds were found at Farmana in the Indus Valley during the Harappan period between 2600-2200 BC.\n\nTwo-thirds of the world's garlic is produced in China\n\nChina produces the most garlic in the world. India is the second largest producer of garlic, while Bangladesh is the third. In 2021, China produced more than 20.45 million tons of green garlic. There is a lot of Chinese garlic in the Indian market. The specialty of this garlic is its thick buds.\n\npreserved in a mummy\n\nGarlic began to be cultivated in the fourth century BC. The oldest remains of garlic were found in a cave in Ein Geda, Israel around 4000 BC. Its earliest mention in historical documents in Egypt comes from the 'Avesta', one of the Zoroastrian scriptures compiled in the sixth century BC. Garlic has great importance in Egypt. People kept the best quality garlic with the mummies of their loved ones.\n\nGarlic available in salary in Egypt\n\nGarlic is very valuable in Egypt. Because there was a custom of keeping a clove of garlic with the mummy. Garlic dating back to 1325 BC was found in Tutankhamun's heavily guarded tomb in Egypt. It was so popular among the workers building the pyramid that work was stopped due to a lack of garlic. They also got it as wages for the workers who built the pyramids in Egypt.\n\nAthletes from the Greek Olympians to the Roman gladiators under Nero used garlic to increase their stamina.\n\nStinking roses repel rabbits and moles\n\nGarlic plants repel rabbits and moles. Because of its strong smell, it is also called the stinking rose. The garlic used is the root part of the plant. Garlic was used in traditional medicine in Egypt, Japan, China, Rome and Greece. Green garlic makes food spicy and adds flavor and fragrance. Green garlic is chopped and fried in Vietnamese, Thai, Myanmar, Laotian, Cambodian, Singaporean and Chinese cuisine. Garlic is indispensable in Arabic cuisine.\n\nGarlic born from a drop of demon blood\n\nAccording to the scriptures, offering onions and garlic to God is forbidden. Therefore, both are not used in religious activities. There is also a mythological story behind it.\n\nIt is said that the gods and demons together churned the ocean to regain the lost wealth of heaven. During the churning of the ocean, a pot of nectar with many jewels came out along with Goddess Lakshmi. When there was a dispute between the gods and demons about drinking nectar, Lord Vishnu assumed the form of Mohini and started distributing the nectar.\n\nFirst it was the turn of the gods to drink the nectar and then Lord Vishnu started forcing the gods to drink the nectar one by one. Then the demon assumed the form of a god and placed himself in their ranks.\n\nThe sun god and the moon god recognized him. He told Lord Vishnu the truth about this demon and then Lord Vishnu beheaded him with his chakra. He drank some of the nectar that was still in his mouth. Due to the decapitation, some drops of blood and nectar fell on the ground. Garlic and onions come from it. Because of this, it is not included in fasting or worship.\n\nThe importance of garlic in different religions\n\nGarlic is also a companion of health. Garlic is effective in everything from digestion to fighting bacteria.\n\nUsing garlic for healing\n\nIn ancient Indian and Chinese medical systems, garlic was used to improve breathing, digestion, and treat leprosy and infections. The 14th-century Muslim physician Avicenna recommended garlic for toothaches, chronic coughs, constipation, snake and insect bites, and women's ailments.\n\nBenefits of eating garlic on an empty stomach\n\ncholesterol-Eating garlic on an empty stomach keeps cholesterol under control. It helps in increasing the level of HDL ie. of good cholesterol by reducing LDL, i.e. bad cholesterol.\n\nalzheimer-The antioxidant properties present in garlic protect against oxidative damage. Which increases memory and thinking ability in Alzheimer's disease and dementia.\n\nblood pressure-The problem of high blood pressure is caused by sulfur deficiency. In such a situation, the organic sulfur compound present in garlic can lower blood pressure.\n\nweight-To control weight, eat garlic on an empty stomach. Garlic has anti-obesity properties. Eating this produces heat in the body, which reduces weight.\n\nDental health -Allicin, present in garlic, fights caries and periodontitis. Using mouthwash or toothpaste containing garlic extract protects teeth from damage.\n\nskin-Garlic extract is effective in the treatment of itching and redness with peeling of the upper layer of the skin, healing of scars, healing of wounds, viral and fungal infections, leishmaniasis, wrinkles and refreshes the skin.\n\nhair- Garlic extract is effective in relieving the problem of alopecia areata, i.e. hair loss in patches. Garlic is also useful in removing dandruff from the hair.\n\nWhatever you say, garlic is not only a party, but also a trickster. Sometimes, when the raita comes, it enhances the flavor of the pulao or biryani, and at the end of the meal, it appears on the plate in the form of kheer. It does not change color like a melon, but it knows the magic of improving taste.",

        "title": "World News | Trump Wins South Carolina, Easily Beating Haley in Her Home State and Closing in on GOP Nomination | LatestLY",
        "text": "Charleston (South Carolina), Feb 25 (AP) Donald Trump won South Carolina's Republican primary on Saturday, easily beating former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley in her home state and further consolidating his path to a third straight GOP nomination.\n\nTrump has now swept every contest that counted for Republican delegates, adding to previous wins in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The former president's latest victory will likely increase pressure on Haley, who was Trump's former representative to the U.N. and South Carolina governor from 2011 to 2017, to leave the race.\n\nAlso Read | Ukraine Embassy in India, European Union Delegation Observe Minute of Silence To Mark Second Anniversary of Russia's War.\n\nA 2020 general rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden is becoming increasingly inevitable. Haley has vowed to stay in the race through at least the batch of primaries on March 5, known as Super Tuesday, but was unable to dent Trump's momentum in her home state despite holding far more campaign events and arguing that the indictments against Trump will hamstring him against Biden.\n\nThe Associated Press declared Trump the winner as polls closed statewide at 7 pm. That race call was based on an analysis of AP VoteCast, a comprehensive survey of Republican South Carolina primary voters. The survey confirmed the findings of pre-Election Day polls showing Trump far outpacing Haley statewide.\n\nAlso Read | Bangladesh Shocker: Minor Boy Dies During Circumcision Surgery in Dhaka Hospital, Family Alleges Overdose of Anesthesia During Surgery.\n\n\"I have never seen the Republican Party so unified as it is right now,\" Trump declared, taking the stage for his victory speech mere moments after polls closed. He added, \"You can celebrate for about 15 minutes, but then we have to get back to work.\"\n\nSouth Carolina's first-in-the-South primary has historically been a reliable bellwether for Republicans. In all but one primary since 1980, the Republican winner in South Carolina has gone on to be the party's nominee. The lone exception was Newt Gingrich in 2012.\n\nMany Trump-backing South Carolinians, even some who previously supported Haley during her time as governor, weren't willing to give her a home-state bump.\n\n\"She's done some good things,\" Davis Paul, 36, said about Haley as he waited for Trump at a recent rally in Conway. \"But I just don't think she's ready to tackle a candidate like Trump. I don't think many people can.\"\n\nAt Haley headquarters on Saturday night, her supporters waved her signs in front of a large projection screen showing Trump's speech, blocking it from view. That, of course, didn't make the defeat any less crushing.\n\nHaley insisted in recent days that she would head straight to Michigan for its Tuesday primary, the last major contest before Super Tuesday. Still, she faces questions about where she might be able to win a contest or be competitive.\n\nTrump and Biden are already behaving like they expect to face off in November.\n\nTrump and his allies argue Biden has made the US weaker and point to the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and Russia's decision to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Trump has also repeatedly attacked Biden over high inflation earlier in the president's term and his handling of record-high migrant crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nTrump has questioned -- often in harshly personal terms -- whether the 81-year-old Biden is too old to serve a second term. Biden's team in turn has highlighted the 77-year-old Trump's own flubs on the campaign trail.\n\nBiden has stepped up his recent fundraising trips around the country and increasingly attacked Trump directly. He's called Trump and his \"Make America Great Again\" movement dire threats to the nation's founding principles, and the president's reelection campaign has lately focused most of its attention on Trump suggesting he'd use the first day of a second presidency as a dictator and that he'd tell Russia to attack NATO allies who fail to keep up with defense spending obligations mandated by the alliance.\n\nHaley also criticized Trump on his NATO comments and also for questioning why her husband wasn't on the campaign trail with her -- even as former first lady Melania Trump hasn't appeared with him. Maj. Michael Haley is deployed in the Horn of Africa on a mission with the South Carolina Army National Guard.\n\nBut South Carolina's Republican voters line up with Trump on having lukewarm feelings about NATO and continued U.S. support for Ukraine, according to AP VoteCast data from Saturday's primary. About 6 in 10 oppose continuing aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia. Only about a third described America's participation in NATO as \"very good,\" with more saying it's only \"somewhat good.\"\n\nHaley has raised copious amounts of campaign money and is scheduled to begin a cross-country campaign swing on Sunday in Michigan ahead of Super Tuesday on March 5, when many delegate-rich states hold primaries.\n\nBut it's unclear how she can stop Trump from clinching enough delegates to become the party's presumptive nominee for the third time.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., complimented Haley while speaking to reporters at Trump's election night party in Columbia but suggested it was time for her to drop out.\n\n\"I think the sooner she does, the better for her, the better for the party,\" Graham said. Later, the senator was greeted with boos after Trump called him to the stage to address those gathered.\n\nTrump's political strength has endured despite facing 91 criminal charges related to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden, the discovery of classified documents in his Florida residence and allegations that he secretly arranged payoffs to a porn actress.\n\nThe former president's first criminal trial is set to begin on March 25 in New York, where he faces 34 counts of falsifying business records related to hush money paid to porn star Stormy Daniels in the closing weeks of his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nBiden won South Carolina's Democratic primary earlier this month and faces only one remaining challenger, Dean Phillips. The Minnesota Democratic congressman has continued to campaign in Michigan ahead of the Democratic primary there, despite having little chance of actually beating Biden.\n\nThough Biden is expected to cruise to his party's renomination, he faces criticism from some Democrats for providing military backing to Israel in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Some in his party support a ceasefire as the death toll in Israel's war has reached 30,000 people, two-thirds of them women and children. The war could hurt the president's general election chances in swing states like Michigan, which is home to a large Arab American population. (AP)",

        "title": "India and Middle East: The Evolving Dynamics - The Sunday Guardian Live",
        "text": "Let multi-alignments, rather than a singular focus, be the basis of its policy recalibration.\n\nIndia must remain nimble, constantly ready to respond to the escalating security concerns in the Middle East. However, this agility should not entail impulsive shifts in foreign policy or inconsistencies with its long-term objectives. The calibrated shift must consider the emergence of multiple regional powers, each supported by a cohort of allies from both within and outside the region. The emerging multipolar situation, with more than one global or regional power calling the shots and, at times, punching above its weight, will not, however, be without its own set of peculiarities and imponderables.\n\nWith Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Israel emerging as the new regional powers, the Western bloc, currently led by the US, will need to reassess its allies and adversaries. This re-evaluation will necessitate acknowledging both formal and less recognized entities, including armed local groups in the countries of West Asia. For a time, the West, particularly the US, may struggle with the realization that it no longer holds undisputed military and economic influence in the Middle East. The Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) member-nations such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, and Oman, besides Egypt, and the Palestinian National Authority are other critical players with whom India's ties have the potential of being strengthened. Each of these countries, individually as well as along with their neighbours, is capable of significantly influencing the regional dynamics.\n\nIndia's relationship with each of these eight countries, starting with Israel, the Palestinian National Authority, Iran, and Saudi Arabia is discussed in this piece, with the remainder to be covered in the next. The impact of the duality in India's policy viz. strengthening ties with both the Arab world and Israel -- will be a subject in both parts of this analysis. It is also important to explore issues critical to India, such as energy security, the large Indian diaspora in West Asia, the significant remittances they send back to their families in India, and the growing importance of Indian commercial interests in certain Middle Eastern countries.\n\nISRAEL\n\nAfter a rather frosty relationship in the initial years following its creation in 1948, with India totally supporting the Arab nations and the Palestinians, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao in 1992 took the significant step of formally establishing diplomatic relations with Israel. Since then, India has increasingly warmed up to Israel in both economic and security matters. Today, it is India's second-largest supplier of arms and technology, and there is a noticeable bonhomie in their relationship. This perhaps influenced India's initial stance in siding with Israel in the early days of the ongoing conflict, following Hamas' firing of hundreds of missiles from Gaza and taking 250 Israeli civilians as hostages.\n\nFinding the subsequent Israeli retaliation disproportionately severe, and with the world community -- including its Western allies -- calling for restraint in attacks on civilian settlements, India has adopted a more nuanced and balanced approach to its support. Since then, while condemning Hamas for its indiscriminate initial attacks on Israeli territory, India has reasserted its historical support for the two-state solution regarding Palestine and supported the UN and other efforts to achieve both an interim and a lasting ceasefire, aiming to bring the warring sides to the negotiation table. India has also increased its naval operations against the Houthis and others engaging in acts of piracy, without joining the American and British military actions against the Houthis in the Red Sea. Such a calculated response must remain the hallmark of its policy, lest the decades of neutrality and careful balancing turn into wasted effort.\n\nFor India, Israel is not only a major supplier of sophisticated military hardware and systems but also an important source of assistance in agricultural technology, medical start-ups, and as an investor in Indian real estate. Indian tech companies find Israel's high-tech economy and culture of innovation suitable for investments. During Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit in July 2017, agreements were signed to enhance collaboration in science, agriculture, defence, and to set up a $40 million technology innovation fund. There is now extensive co-operation in counterterrorism, intelligence sharing, homeland, and cyber security. This is happening at a time when Israel also maintains a close economic and defence relationship with China, which, according to Netanyahu, is mainly interested in its technology. Fortunately, in the overall favourable milieu of rapprochement with Israel building up among the Middle East nations, augmenting bilateral relations between Israel and India is no longer an issue of major concern. However, as India proceeds, it must invariably remain cognizant of not wavering from the path of extending political support to the cause of Palestine. Alongside, India needs to continue its growing efforts at building up bilateral relations with most of the Arab nations.\n\nNo doubt, Russia has now become India's favoured supplier of crude oil. Nonetheless, India's dependence on the Middle East for its huge and growing need for hydrocarbons is expected to remain significant in the decades ahead. The transition of the Indian energy sector to renewables and electric mobility is anticipated to be gradual. Much of India's crude refining capacity has been developed to process crude oil that meets Arabian specifications. Logistically, there is a clear advantage in terms of distance and proximity, especially for refineries located on the west coast of India.\n\nThere are 9.5 million Indian workers in the Gulf, and their annual remittances play a crucial role in replenishing India's foreign exchange reserves and maintaining the value of the Indian rupee. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows from the Middle East, particularly from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, seem highly promising. With Bilateral Investment Protection Agreements (BIPAs) being signed with these countries -- Prime Minister Modi oversaw the signing of one in the UAE last fortnight -- the anticipated equity inflows of $75 billion from the UAE, the $100 billion announced by Saudi Arabia in 2019, and $35 billion from Qatar should be possible.\n\nPALESTINIAN NATIONAL AUTHORITY\n\nEver since Prime Minister Nehru's time, India has extended total support to Palestine, a stance that has remained an article of faith for the country. This strong affirmation had, in fact, prevented India from establishing normal relations with Israel until 1992, when India initiated diplomatic relations with Israel. Until then, the Palestinian issue had been central to India's foreign policy in the Middle East and, to some extent, with the United States. However, the rapprochement between Israel and Egypt in 1979, with Jordan in 1994, and later, in 2020, the signing of formal normalization agreements with Gulf Arab states -- UAE, Bahrain, Sudan, and Morocco (also known as the Abraham Accords) -- under President Trump's initiative, has seen the salience of Palestine in India's external affairs decline. The suspension by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu of plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank was viewed as a contribution to the Palestinian cause. Nevertheless, the Palestinian leadership expressed disappointment at such recognitions by the Arab states. Its Foreign Minister, Riad Maliki, called it violative of the 2002 Saudi Arab Peace Initiative, which set two preconditions for such normalization: a full Israeli withdrawal to the pre-1967 lines and the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital. The failure of the Arab League to address the actions of the UAE and other member states had led to Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Fatah in the occupied West Bank co-operating in renewing the Palestinian unity talks.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority looks to India for its continued and steadfast support for the two-nation theory. India would do well to not move away from this stance. Its public endorsement, as demonstrated by President Pranab Mukherjee's visit to Palestine in 2015, Prime Minister Modi's visit in 2017, and the return visit the same year by President Mahmoud Abbas of Palestine , as well as the economic co-operation and financial assistance, must remain fully intact. India should surely lend a hand in the rebuilding of the war-ravaged Gaza once the ground situation permits.\n\nSAUDI ARABIA\n\nSaudi Arabia has become India's fourth-largest trading partner with $28 bn in bilateral trade, though much of it is imported crude oil. Since establishing a formal mechanism in 2014 for defence cooperation, both countries have shared intelligence and counterterrorism efforts (targeting terrorists in Pakistan as well as radical Sunni groups in Syria that pose a threat to Saudi Arabia). In 2019, they signed another agreement for the procurement and joint production of military equipment, in addition to holding joint air and naval exercises. Following the Covid-19 pandemic years, these initiatives have been put into action.\n\nThe Saudis, fearing both the ideological stance and the emerging military strength of Iran -- especially its nuclear capabilities -- expect India to distance itself from Iran. This has hitherto been difficult to concede by India, given its traditional and extensive ties with Iran. However, this stance may soon need to be reconsidered. As if in anticipation of it, the Saudis have shown a shift in their position; they no longer explicitly side with Pakistan and did not criticise India in 2019 when it revoked the limited autonomy of Kashmir and introduced a new citizenship law, which allegedly discriminated against Muslims and stirred controversy. Despite its growing security-related and economic proximity with the US and rapid progress towards becoming a regional superpower, Saudi Arabia's friendly postures have aided India's rise in status in the Middle East. India must not let go of this route to elevation in position in the Arab World, though it warrants continued caution and careful balancing. To further cement its ties with this wealthy and influential centre of Islam, India may need to go the extra mile.\n\nIRAN\n\nAfter the revolution of 1979, which saw the deposition of its Shah and the orthodox Shia religious leadership come to power, Iran has survived decades of a wide range of Western economic and military sanctions, as well as growing isolation from its neighbours. In fact, by skilfully challenging the international order and forming unconventional alliances, it might have even thrived. Iran makes no secret of its perpetual state of conflict with the \"Satanic\" USA. A high degree of pragmatism in advancing its own interests has enabled it to achieve a degree of well-being without sacrificing its ideological objectives. This is evident in its relationship with India as well, which it recognises as gradually moving into the Western camp.\n\nIndia and Iran have had historical relations, both at the government level and through people-to-people connections. The Parsis migrated from Iran, and several Indian businessmen have roots there. However, due to the \"US factor,\" the relationship has not fully evolved. In 2019, US sanctions compelled India to cease its crude imports from Iran. Yet, Iran has allowed Indian goods to transit to Central Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and the Gulf. Allowing India to develop the Chabahar Port, the first terminal of which became operational in December 2017, located next to the border with Pakistan, would further facilitate Indian interests, besides possibly resuming Iranian oil imports. Upon being exempted from US sanctions, India is constructing a $1.6 billion rail link from Chabahar to Zahedan in the north. However, for various reasons, progress on this project has been tardy.\n\nGoing forward, India might face challenges given that China and Iran have a 25-year-long and $400 billion worth bilateral security and economic partnership. In 2020, Iran made adverse comments regarding India's revocation of Article 370 concerning Kashmir. Understandably, this prompted the Indian defence and foreign ministers to hastily visit Tehran to assuage their concerns and assure them of India's continued interest in strengthening bilateral ties. Yet, in the years ahead, there might be a dilution of these ties, largely due to shifts in both regional and global geopolitics.\n\nDr Ajay Dua, a development economist, is an ex-Union Secretary, Ministry of Commerce & Industry.\n\nPart 3 of the article covering ties with GCC and its member-nations UAE, Qatar and Oman besides Egypt will follow.",

The Minnesota Democratic congressman has continued to campaign in Michigan ahead of the Democratic primary there, despite having little chance of actually beating Biden.\n\nThough Biden is expected to cruise to his party's renomination, he faces criticism from some Democrats for providing military backing to Israel in its war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Some in his party support a ceasefire as the death toll in Israel's war has reached 30,000 people, two-thirds of them women and children. The war could hurt the president's general election chances in swing states like Michigan, which is home to a large Arab American population. (AP)",

        "title": "The 'western' influence on Malaysian politics",
        "text": "Our political system is a mixture of what has come from the Brits, Arabs and a pre-colonial feudalistic Malay society.\n\nHere's an argument we often hear in Malaysia's political debate: that some of us are lackeys and toadies unthinkingly clinging to western legacies we learnt at the feet of our colonial masters back in those days.\n\nThese often come from the more nationalistic and religious elements of our political and social classes. Hence it's no coincidence we're hearing them a lot in the noises surrounding the Federal Court's ruling against Kelantan's state shariah laws.\n\nHere's the irony - the people who accuse others of that are the very people who borrow heavily on ideas that also came from the west, even if their \"west\" is what we call the Middle-East, which in spite of its name, is still westerly to us!\n\nA case of the pot calling the kettle black? Perhaps. But it's certainly undeniable the greatest influence on how our country is run came from the westerly direction - the westerly British Isles as well as the westerly Saudi peninsula.\n\nThis isn't to belittle the contributions to our rich multicultural mix that came from elsewhere. But the reality remains that - socio-cultural considerations aside - there isn't much in our political system that comes from the more easterly and neighbourly parts of the world.\n\nMalaysians are, by and large, happy we're a nation built on western ideas and ideals. Even when Mahathir pivoted away from the west and told Malaysians to \"Look East\", he meant emulate the Japanese work ethics, business and social systems, and not their political systems.\n\nTruth be told though, Mahathir's fascination with Japan had more to do with their unquestioning subservience to their leaders, something that seemed to have survived in their society in spite of massive social and technological changes, and something that he seemed envious of.\n\nThat being the case, perhaps it worked out well he never got his wishes. Anyway, it took millennia for the combined impacts of social, cultural, environmental and political factors on the Japanese to get them where they are now, whether for good or bad. They didn't get there just because a prime minister wished it so.\n\nGiven Japan and the UK are now in the early throes of an economic recession, many in them are also advocating more radical changes to how the countries should be run, even if it means implementing (increasingly bad) ideas from elsewhere.\n\nSo, our political system is a mixture that comes from the west - whether from the Brits or the Arabs - mixed with something more home-grown - the feudalism that was the foundation of Malay society even before the Portuguese, Dutch, British and Arab influences took root.\n\nIncidentally, that feudalism is also a leftover from the periods when the Malays - the non-constitutional Malays of back then - were Hindus, as can be seen from their emphasis on classes and hierarchies. Yet another influence from the west!\n\nMuch of the world generally agrees democracy - which Winston Churchill called \"the worst form of government ...except for the other forms that have been tried...\" is workable. But I'd also agree democracy itself is getting rather tired and worn-out. It seriously needs a major rethink and overhaul - and I've no idea how it can be rethought and overhauled. So, I'd rather just stay with the devil I know than ones I don't.\n\nThe problem is the alternative west - the \"near\" west which is the Middle East - hasn't been a shining beacon for humanity either. It is full of, at best, authoritarian - often hereditary - leaders or at worst tyrannical despots more interested in looking out for themselves and their own tribes.\n\nAnd in spite of being glowingly described as the only \"true democracy\" there - Israel - that didn't stop it from being a murderous, genocidal country running around trying to exterminate whole races. Hardly a poster child for democracy, or even humanity.\n\nMeanwhile, back home, our own fellow citizens who denigrate these \"western ideas\" are happy to follow them when it's convenient - such as when winning elections or partaking in parliamentary shenanigans and subterfuges to grab power or riches.\n\nYet even when such people disdain what the \"far west\" called for, they don't deliver what the \"near west\" calls for either. You don't see much fairness, justice, love or wisdom from them. If anything, they've pushed many non-believers further away from them, something that they'd have a lot to answer for.\n\nSo, whilst I believe we've a lot to learn from the two modern and eastern global superpowers - China and India - in terms of economy and industry, and business and technology, there isn't much we can learn from them on politics.\n\nChina is a huge, monolithic one-party state that keeps its political machinations purposely opaque from its population. Its system asks its people to surrender much of their rights in return for prosperity. The country has indeed delivered prosperity, though it remains to be seen how things will be when prosperity becomes harder to deliver.\n\nIndia, the world's largest democracy, is lurching further away towards its own religious extremism. It keeps whatever vestiges of western values or systems only as they're convenient, and also as a cover for other values its leaders actually hold, which are often their own version of race or religious supremacy.\n\nBoth countries are prospering, at least for now. Each justifies what it does as important given their own realities - their size, national challenges and tortured history. And their prosperity makes it convenient to justify the road they take as right and beneficial.\n\nBut neither is a compelling argument for us to change our own political system. Our own challenges are also unique and varied, and whatever system we do have is good enough for us. We just need to adhere to it and deliver to our fellow citizens what is their due.\n\nNeither badmouthing the west for what we inherited, nor comparing us against countries that aren't as great as they make themselves out to be even if we have kinship with them, will help us succeed as a nation.\n\nWe've what we need to move on. We just have to stop making simplistic comparisons for or against our favourite good guys or bad guys out there.\n\nThe views expressed are those of the writer and do not necessarily reflect those of FMT.",

        "text": "The story so far: Israel's war in Gaza in retaliation for the October 7 terror attacks by Hamas took centre-stage at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) this week again, as the UN General Assembly raised the question of illegal Israeli settlements in the court, with public hearings that will end on February 26. The hearings sparked a further divide between Western countries, many of whom sought to defend Israel's bombardment of Gaza as the \"right to self-defence\", and were ranged against Global South countries, most of whom had supported South Africa's bid to have the ICJ try Israel for \"war-crimes\" for its actions. The latest hearings opened in the backdrop of a major rift between Brazil and Israel.\n\nALSO READ Holding Israel accountable What are the ICJ hearings about?\n\nThe current hearings of the ICJ at the Peace Palace in The Hague (The Netherlands) are not a consequence of the Israel-Hamas conflict of the past few months, but pre-date them. In December 2022, the UN General Assembly had asked the court for an \"advisory opinion\" on two specific questions pertaining to Israeli actions in the past: first, what are the \"legal consequences\" for Israel over its policy of \"occupations, settlement and annexation\" of Palestinian territories since the 1967 war, and attempts to change the demographic status of Jerusalem, and second, what legal consequences arise for all other states and the United Nations over Israel's \"discriminatory\" policies towards Palestinians. As many as 52 states and three international organisations gave written and oral comments during the hearings scheduled from February 19-26, led by Palestine, and followed by South Africa.\n\nEditorial | Momentous ruling: On Israel and the International Court of Justice order\n\nWho were the key speakers and what have they said so far?\n\nWhile a majority of the speakers at the hearings are from the Global South led by Brazil and South Africa, all P-5 members of the UN Security council submitted comments, although Israel chose not to participate. India was not among the speakers, but its neighbours, Pakistan and Bangladesh were strongly critical of Israel's actions. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki gave a three-hour high-powered submission in which he said Israeli governments had left only three choices for Palestinians: \"displacement, subjugation or death\", calling their actions: \"ethnic cleansing, apartheid or genocide.\" The U.S., U.K. and allies began submissions with condemnations of the October 7 attack in which more than 1,100 were killed in Israel. Ireland, however, has diverged quite dramatically from the West and the European Union in its criticism of Israel's actions, countering arguments on the \"right to self-defence\" by saying that international law \"limits the use of force in self-defence to no more than what is necessary and proportionate\". More than 29,000 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel's bombardment began. While the ICJ case pertains to events pre-2022, it was clear that the destruction of nearly half of all structures in Gaza in four months are precipitating concerns that Israel plans to occupy and resettle that territory as well. Brazil's ambassador in particular called for the ICJ to pronounce Israel's actions of confiscating land, demolishing Palestinian homes, establishing Israeli settlements, and constructing the West Bank barrier wall as illegal.\n\nALSO READ Brazil's president accuses Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, doubling down after earlier uproar Why have Brazil and Israel drawn daggers?\n\nWhile Brazil and Israel have had close relations in the past, Brazil's President Lula da Silva has been openly critical of \"Zionism\" in the past. For instance, he refused to visit the grave of Theodor Herzl during a visit to Jerusalem in 2010. Last week, Israel declared Mr. Lula a \"persona non grata\" who won't be allowed to enter the country after he compared Israel's bombardment of Palestinians to the Holocaust in Nazi Germany in which six million Jewish people were killed. Brazil has since recalled its ambassador to Israel.\n\nALSO READ Where does India stand on the Israel-Hamas war? | Explained What is India's stand?\n\nDespite its abstention in one vote calling for a ceasefire in October 2023, India has consistently voted in favour of UN resolutions that are critical of Israel's occupation and annexation of Palestinian territory. Unlike the rest of the Global South, however, the Modi government has chosen to keep public comments on the issue to a minimum, and the decision not to speak at the ICJ is in line with that. Several factors complicate clarity on the Indian position. On the one hand, there is an expectation from the Arab world, particularly from close partners such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, for India to stand with Palestine. Qatar, for instance, may have expectations after the Prime Minister's visit this month to thank the Emir for releasing eight Indian naval officers. This may explain why New Delhi has spoken strongly about zero tolerance for the October 7 terror attacks, but has not designated Hamas as a terror group so far.\n\nAlso read | South Africa tells top U.N. court that it's accusing Israel of apartheid against Palestinians\n\nOn the other hand, there is India's close defence and surveillance equipment cooperation with Israel. While India has been buying defence equipment from Israel, recently, it shipped drones made by Adani-Elbit Advanced Systems in Hyderabad to help Israeli operations. In addition, the government has green-lighted the recruitment of tens of thousands of Indian workers by Israeli companies dealing with labour shortages due to the expulsion of Palestinians from jobs post October 7 attacks. However, the area of greatest concern for Indian diplomacy will come if it is seen as an outlier to the Global South that India seeks leadership of, which has been clearly critical of Israel's actions, and is increasingly speaking in one voice for international judicial accountability for them.",

        "title": "The Rise and Fall of the American Jewish Hospital : Academic Medicine",
        "text": "In this essay, the author describes the origins of American Jewish hospitals, the purposes they were designed to serve, and why they are disappearing. He estimates that approximately 113 Jewish hospitals were founded in the history of the United States and that there are now about 22 left, some of which are Jewish in name only. Jewish hospitals have been disappearing as a result of the economic pressures facing all community hospitals, a decline in anti-Semitism, open access to GME positions and hospital privileges, the general acceptance of Jews in the American mainstream, and a loss of Jewish community philanthropy.\n\nAmerican Jewish hospitals, once a powerful force in clinical care and academic medicine, are disappearing. In this article, I will trace the theological, cultural, and social origins of their rise and then describe the economic, social, demographic, and financial causes of their decline.\n\nReligious traditions have long grappled with whether humans have the right to intervene in disease, which some view as divinely visited on the sick. Do physicians have the right to \"interfere\" with the deliberate designs of Providence?\n\nSome religious traditions deal with the issue of a physician's \"interference\" with disease by rejecting medical aid altogether. Others ask, Is there any less moral justification for curing illness than there is for applying human intelligence to build a home or water the soil? Some attempt to resolve the conflict by asserting that God granted humans the right to cure disease based on sanctions found in sacred scriptures.\n\nIn Judaism, there is a strong tradition of support for human efforts to heal the sick, and physicians are held in high esteem. The obligation to heal is found in Leviticus 19:16, in which humans are enjoined not to \"stand idly by the blood of your neighbor,\" and in Exodus 21:18-19, wherein Jews are instructed that if a person is injured in a quarrel, then the individual causing the injury must cause the injured party \"to be thoroughly healed.\" The Talmud (Baba Kamma 85a) invokes the latter verse to teach that \"from here [it is derived] that the physician is granted permission to cure.\"\n\nJudaism also teaches that the value of human life is supreme. The Talmud (Sanhedrin 37a) states that \"if any human being saves a single soul of Israel, Scripture regards him as if he had saved an entire world.\" The Prophet Ezekiel (34:4) chides Jews to include care for the ill as one of the attributes of God that they must emulate: \"You have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick.\" In addition, the Talmud includes multiple references to community health and responsibilities such as visiting the sick and repairing the world.\n\nIn contrast to religious traditions that object to human intervention in disease, free will is deeply embedded in Judaism. The 12th-century rabbi and physician Maimonides wrote that \"free will is bestowed on every human being\" and \"a man's actions are in his own hands; no compulsion is exerted. He is constrained by nothing that is external to him.\" The purpose of keeping the body healthy is to allow the individual to pursue knowledge of God and of God's perfect morality. Maimonides wrote:\n\nthe study of medicine has a very great influence on the acquisition of the virtues and of the knowledge of God, as far as on the attainment of true spiritual happiness. Therefore, its study and acquisition are preeminently important religious activities.\n\nThe development of European Jewish hospitals\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, medicine was one of the few professions open to Jews in Europe. In addition, Medieval Jewish physician-translators helped preserve the medical teachings of the ancient Greeks and Romans and transmit them to the West.\n\nThe English word hospital comes from the same Latin root as hospitality, hostel, and hotel. Early hospitals were religious establishments maintained by Christian, Muslim, and Jewish organizations as places of refuge for travelers, pilgrims, and the needy. As early as the 11th century, European synagogues set aside a hekdesh, or hostel for the poor, which was probably a room for the lodging of travelers that may also have been used as a place to care for sick itinerants. If medicine was not able to cure sick, indigent, traveling Jews, at least they could die with dignity in a hekdesh in the care of their coreligionists. In the 13th and 14th centuries in Spain and Germany, inns for the care of sick strangers were supported by the community, benevolent societies, and charity boxes.\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, Jewish communities erected more elaborate, modern houses for the sick (called Kranken haus) in Breslau, London, Berlin, Vienna, Paris, Amsterdam, and Hamburg. By the early 20th century, there were 48 Jewish hospitals in Poland, including 1,000 beds in Warsaw.\n\nThe \"Stuyvesant Pledge\" and the Jewish community in the American colonies\n\nIn September 1654, the Sainte Catherine, a small French frigate, sailed into New Amsterdam (now New York City) carrying 23 Jewish refugees from Brazil. Peter Stuyvesant, director-general of New Netherlands, requested permission from his superiors at the Dutch West India Company in Amsterdam to refuse entry to these \"deceitful,\" \"very repugnant,\" and \"hateful enemies and blasphemers of the name of Christ.\" To Stuyvesant's distress, his directors reminded him that some of the company's shareholders were Dutch Jews and ordered him to admit the refugees provided they would pledge that \"the poor among them shall not become a burden to the company or to the community, but be supported by their own nation.\"\n\nThe Growth of Jewish Hospitals in the United States\n\nSome historians view the \"Stuyvesant Pledge\" as the foundation of American Jewish communal institutions. The formation of Jewish hospitals in the United States, beginning in the mid-19th century, was a logical continuation in the Jewish community's creation of an extensive social network designed to assure the public that American Jews neither were nor ever would be a societal burden.\n\nThere are at least three other major causes for the creation of American Jewish hospitals. First, the American Jewish community felt that by creating their own hospitals, they could spare their coreligionists the indignity of Christians' attempts to convert them as they lay on their death beds. Second, Jewish hospitals were refuges that respected the faith of American Jews. They provided kosher food, an on-site synagogue, the comfort of a rabbi on the staff, and the placement of a mezuzah on the door post. Because traditional Jewish teaching takes a very circumscribed view of autopsy, Jewish hospitals were also created, in part, to reduce autopsies perceived as unnecessary.\n\nThird, Jewish hospitals were built in response to anti-Semitism in the medical profession. From the beginning of the 20th century through the 1960s, most U.S. medical schools and hospitals had restrictive quota systems designed to deny medical school admission to Jewish applicants, restrict the access of Jewish medical school graduates to internship and residency training in hospitals, and deny hospital staff privileges to Jewish physicians. Some institutions justified their quotas as favoring in-state applicants or promoting religious diversity in the physician workforce. Jewish hospitals provided workplaces for Jewish interns, residents, and physicians who were excluded from employment at other hospitals. Those few Jewish physicians who obtained positions in non-Jewish hospitals were subject to physical harassment as well as written and verbal abuse.\n\nIn the United States prior to the mid-19th century, there were few Jewish physicians and no Jewish hospitals. Relatively secular German-Jewish immigrants fostered the first wave of hospital construction from 1854 to 1880, starting with the establishment of the Jewish Hospital Association of Cincinnati in 1854. By the time of the Civil War, the Jews' Hospital in Manhattan had opened its doors to both Jews and non-Jews, and it explicitly offered its services for the care of the Civil War wounded. Soon after the war, the hospital changed its name to the more inclusive Mount Sinai Hospital. By 1868, there were also hospitals under Jewish auspices in Baltimore, Chicago, and Philadelphia. The second wave of construction, from 1880 to 1945, was fostered by more religiously observant East European Jewish immigrants.\n\nIn the last wave of construction, which was fueled by the Hill-Burton Act between 1945 and 1960, the number of beds in Jewish hospitals increased from 13,800 to 18,283. Philanthropic support to these institutions exceeded $18 million dollars per year, and social prestige within the Jewish community was associated with membership on a hospital board of trustees. In 1966, U.S. Jewish hospitals had an aggregate bed capacity of 25,000, admitted more than 560,000 patients, delivered about 75,800 babies, and recorded approximately 3.5 million outpatient visits.\n\nHow Many Jewish Hospitals Were There? How Many Are There Now?\n\nThe American Jewish community founded many hospitals with clearly identifiable Jewish names. Eighteen hospital names contained the word Jewish, and five contained the word Hebrew. Fourteen were named Mount Sinai or Sinai, eight were named Beth Abraham, Beth David, Beth El, or Beth Israel, three were named Montefiore, and two were named Menorah.\n\nIt is difficult to determine the total number of Jewish hospitals founded and operated in the United States because of openings, closings, name or location changes, gaps in the historical record, consolidation of two or more hospitals under a new name, and uncertainty about distinctions between hospitals, tuberculosis sanatoriums, chronic disease care institutions, and nursing homes. (In at least one case, I found that a hospital with a \"Jewish-sounding name\" was a Protestant institution.) After reviewing the published literature and consulting primary sources extensively, my best estimate is that, throughout U.S. history, there have been 113 Jewish hospitals. Of these 113 hospitals, 22 (19%) are still operating independently under a name and with other characteristics that at least minimally connote a Jewish heritage, and 24 (21%) have been purchased by or merged with 1 of the 22 still-extant Jewish hospitals. Another 35 (31%) have closed, whereas 24 (21%) have been purchased or merged with a non-Jewish hospital chain, and 9 (8%) are operating as old age/nursing home/rehabilitation facilities. These 113 hospitals were key components of undergraduate medical education and graduate medical education (GME) in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, and San Francisco, and some maintain that role today.\n\nBut are the 22 hospitals that continue to operate independently still Jewish? Most have little or no input into their governance by the organized Jewish community as well as medical staffs and patient populations that are not predominantly Jewish. Several are in the process of merging with other, non-Jewish hospitals. This raises a broader issue: What does it mean to be an American Jewish hospital?\n\nWhat Is a Jewish Hospital?\n\nTo define what it means to be a Roman Catholic hospital in the United States, you could turn to the Catholic Church's ethical and religious directives regarding the operations of hospital and health systems and, by analyzing them, understand what a hospital would need to do to meet the standards. There are, in contrast, no equivalent documents that could help you determine what is and what is not a Jewish hospital.\n\nIt is not surprising that there is no consensus among American Jews concerning the definition or mission of a Jewish hospital. The Jewish community in the United States is characterized by a wide diversity of beliefs and ritual practices, a high rate of intermarriage, and low rates of synagogue membership and attendance. The largest American Jewish denomination, Reform, tried to craft an official prayer book in 1975 and ended up with 10 different Sabbath evening prayer services reflecting alternative, and sometimes contradictory, theological perspectives. (A subsequent Reform prayer book provided a more unified approach.)\n\nFor the purposes of this article, I will define a Jewish hospital as one which possesses most of the following characteristics:\n\nUsing this definition, not more than five contemporary American hospitals with Jewish names meet most of the criteria. (In contrast to the decline of Jewish hospitals, an increasing proportion of U.S. hospital beds are in Catholic hospitals.) For many secular American Jews, however, it may be sufficient to define the remaining Jewish hospitals as Jewish if they are \"not Christian\" (i.e., if they do not display Christmas trees or other outward signs of Christian observance).\n\nThe Fall of Jewish Hospitals\n\nThere are three major reasons for the disappearance of American Jewish hospitals: economics, decline in anti-Semitism, and demographic changes that affect philanthropy. I will consider each of these below.\n\nEconomics\n\nJewish hospitals are subject to the same marketplace pressures as their non-Jewish counterparts. Changes in Medicare regulations in the 1970s and 1980s, the rise of health maintenance organizations in the 1990s, and advances in medical technology prompted a wave of hospital acquisitions and mergers in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. While large, for-profit entities entered the industry, many small hospitals were impelled to close or consolidate. These changes particularly affected independent, community-based hospitals, including Jewish hospitals.\n\nDecline in anti-Semitism\n\nBlatant anti-Semitic quotas designed to restrict Jews' access to medical school, internship and residency, and hospital staff privileges declined in the 1960s. Such quotas and restrictions are now both socially unacceptable and illegal. The impetus for Jewish hospitals as a response to anti-Semitism in the medical profession has therefore largely disappeared. (For example, part of the motivation for New York's Mount Sinai Hospital to establish its own medical school was to preserve a pipeline for recruiting Jewish physicians and scientists who were now able to secure positions elsewhere.) Jewish applicants for GME positions may now seek jobs at any U.S. teaching hospital. Similarly, practicing Jewish physicians may apply for staff privileges anywhere without concern that their religion will stand in the way.\n\nDemographics and philanthropy\n\nFinally, the population of self-identifying Jews is shrinking as a proportion of the total U.S. population. In the 1940s, the Jewish population peaked at 3.7% of the U.S. population. In 2010, the Jewish population comprised 1.9% to 2.2% of the U.S. population.\n\nThere has also been a general assimilation of the American Jewish community. The intermarriage rate is approximately 50%. Polling of American Jews shows that affirmative responses to the statement \"I have a strong sense of belonging to the Jewish people\" decline according to the age of respondents, from a high of 72% among individuals aged 65 years or older to a low of 47% for adults younger than 35. Further, the number of American Jews reporting that most of their close friends are Jewish fell by 10% from 1990 to 2000. The proportions of American Jews belonging to Jewish organizations other than synagogues and Jewish community centers, of those saying they have made donations to the Jewish Federation (the Jewish community-wide charitable body), and of those observing religious rituals have also decreased.\n\nSimilarly, the proportion of Jews holding the traditional Jewish viewpoint that all Jews are responsible for one another is declining. A 1998 survey reported that only 52% of American Jews agreed with the statement \"I look at the entire Jewish community as my extended family,\" and 47% agreed that \"I have a special responsibility to take care of Jews in need around the world.\"\n\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that philanthropic support for Jewish hospitals has also declined among American Jews. Organizations that were founded to provide services or employment mostly to Jews have quietly broadened their missions to accommodate and serve a diverse audience in order to survive. Jewish hospitals located in urban, historically Jewish neighborhoods have seen their constituencies move to the suburbs, where suburban Jews have sometimes created new hospitals. Often, the Jewish hospitals that were \"left behind\" have disappeared, although there are a few notable exceptions that either have carved out a market niche or have persisted because of a concentration of urban Orthodox Jews.\n\nTraditionally, Jewish Americans concentrated their charitable donations on Jewish causes. However, the frequency of wealthy American Jews focusing on Jewish communal organizations as the major locus of their philanthropy has fallen from near 100% to 33%. Jewish Federation support to hospitals has also fallen: In 1959, approximately 25% of the total funds available to Jewish Federations for local purposes were spent on hospitals and other medical programs. After the creation of Medicare in 1966 and states' widespread adoption of Medicaid in 1967, hospitals began to derive large proportions of their income from these two government-funded sources and from insurance payers. In light of these changes, by 1967, Jewish philanthropic bodies were reassessing the rationale for Jewish hospitals and hospitals' continued need for Jewish Federation financing. By the end of the 20th century, Jewish hospitals received less than 2% of their revenue from Jewish umbrella funds or Federations.\n\nConcurrent with the decline in impetus for American Jews to provide philanthropic support to Jewish hospitals, there has been a rise in the acceptance of Jews into upper-class social circles in the United States. Not surprisingly, this rise has been associated with philanthropy from Jews being directed to secular universities, opera companies, symphonies, museums, social and civic causes, and non-Jewish hospitals and medical schools. For example, after World War II, Cornell University Medical College was threatened with lawsuits and governmental hearings regarding its admission quotas that discriminated against Jewish applicants. Now, the Weill Cornell Medical College is named after a Jewish philanthropist and his wife who donated several hundred million dollars to a medical school that probably would not have admitted Mr. Weill's coreligionists in generations past.\n\nConclusion: Does It Matter?\n\nMany Jewish hospitals have been sold, and the proceeds of those sales have been used to endow grant-making foundations. Recent sales have created assets that constitute almost 5% of the total assets of Jewish foundations. Some of these Jewish foundations have concentrated their grant making on health and human services, whereas others have focused on the needs of elderly Jews, recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union, people with disabilities, and Holocaust survivors.\n\nBut does the disappearance of American Jewish hospitals matter? It seems to be to the detriment of traditional Jewish commitments to education and to provision of health care to the poor. Also, it is a loss to the extent that Jewish hospitals have served as a \"public face\" of the Jewish community in the United States. On the other hand, American Jewish hospitals may be the victims of the American Jewish community's successes. In the late 20th century, the American Jewish community secured consistent support for Israel, participated in successful efforts to release a million Jews from the former Soviet Union, won widespread recognition of the Holocaust, and helped strike down residual, institutionalized anti-Semitism in housing, resorts, university admissions, and employment.\n\nFurther, the multiple achievements of the American Jewish community in the medical profession, the decline in anti-Semitism, open access to GME positions and hospital privileges, and the general acceptance of Jews in the American mainstream have, in many cases, made American Jewish hospitals into historical artifacts. In addition, although there are some areas in the United States with high concentrations of Orthodox Jews, the majority of American Jews do not insist that hospitals provide kosher food, Sabbath elevators, a synagogue, and a Jewish administrative and medical staff.\n\nMany of the remaining \"Jewish hospitals\" are simply bricks and mortar with Jewish plaques and signs that no longer meet the criteria that would define them as Jewish. The evolving U.S. hospital marketplace and cultural changes have combined, in large measure, to make the distinctly Jewish hospital an endangered species that will likely survive in only a few places. These disappearing hospitals leave behind a proud legacy: They are institutions that succeeded so profoundly in abetting the success of the American Jewish community that they became unnecessary.\n\nAcknowledgments: The author benefited from the thoughtful comments of Rabbis Avrohom Litvin and Joseph Rooks Rappaport.",

In 2022, MBZ became president of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nEarlier this month, Prime Minister Modi visited the Gulf country to inaugurate the first Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi. It was his seventh visit to the United Arab Emirates.

More clarity is needed on the macro-economic factors that were taken into account and the method used in arriving at the figures. There cannot be so much of a variation in the projections.

        "text": "Just a few years ago, Pinaki Bhattacharya found himself estranged from his family after he decided to renounce Hinduism and embrace Islam, influenced by Tablighi Jamaat. Pinaki Bhattacharya was born in 1967 in Jaleshory Tola, Bogra District of Bangladesh. His father's name is Shaymol Bhattacharya, who was a school teacher at Bagura Zila School and also a Cultural Organizer. Pinaki is the elder son of Shaymol Bhattacharya, and his mother's name is Shukrity Bhattacharya. He has a brother named Avro Bhattacharya and a sister named Lopa Mudra Bhattacharya. From 1985 to 1992, Pinaki attended Rajshahi Medical College.\n\nHis father, Shyamal Bhattacharya, a respected school teacher, writer, and drama actor, was deeply disheartened by his son's religious conversion. Their relationship soured to the point where Shyamal, in a fit of anger, disowned Pinaki, cutting off all communication. Pinaki, graduated from Rajshahi Medical College in 1992, an institution with a reputation for being associated with Jamaat-e-Islami activities.\n\nUpon learning of Pinaki's affiliations with ISI and his ties to Islamists, jihadists, and terrorists, his wife, also a physician, distanced herself from him. While residing in Bangladesh, Pinaki, under the guise of producing life-saving drugs in his pharmaceutical factory, engaged in illicit activities, manufacturing counterfeit medicine and 'Yaba' tablets-a potent mixture of methamphetamine and caffeine-which were distributed through criminal networks. As law enforcement agencies began to close in on his illegal operations, Pinaki fled Bangladesh and sought asylum in France, falsely claiming to be a \"political victim\" of the Awami League government.\n\nIn France, Pinaki holds two occupations: he operates an illegal hawala business and manages social media accounts, including a YouTube channel with nearly two million subscribers. The majority of his YouTube audience comprises semi-educated and uneducated individuals from Bangladesh and West Bengal, along with significant viewership from Bangladeshi laborers in various countries such as Malaysia and the Middle East.\n\nThrough his YouTube channel, Pinaki Bhattacharya, allegedly associated with the Pakistani intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), disseminates venomous content and propagates vile messages. He targets Bharat (India), Hindu dharma, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), and opposes anti-Islamist and anti-jihadist movements within India and Bangladesh.\n\nOn February 22, 2204, Pinaki posted on Facebook, advising Bangladeshi directors and actors against collaborating with West Bengal-based OTT platform Hoichoi or any other Indian platforms. He specifically urged Bangladeshi actor Mosharraf Karim not to promote his upcoming movie 'Hubba' for Hoichoi. The post concluded with a thinly veiled threat directed towards Bangladeshi directors and actors, expressing his hope that he wouldn't need to take a harsher stance.\n\nIn one of his recent videos, which amassed 7.1 lakh views within five days, Pinaki Bhattacharya likened Hindutva to Zionism and voiced apprehensions regarding India's increasing global influence. He implicated me as both an Indian and Israeli agent operating within Bangladesh. Furthermore, he labeled internationally acclaimed, multi-award-winning anti-militancy journalist and editor of Blitz, Salah Uddin Shoaib Choudhury, as an enemy of the people. Pinaki encouraged his supporters to engage in online harassment by derogatorily branding Shoaib Choudhury as a \"bastard\" on social media.\n\nIn the same video, Pinaki prominently promoted a video from a Pakistani YouTube channel called 'The Blank Page Official', which claimed that \"India has activated powerful assets to counter Bangladesh's India Out campaign.\" He also attempted to discredit Blitz by labeling it as an \"asset\" of India and Israel. According to reports from Indian media outlets, Pinaki Bhattacharya is described as an extremist who holds anti-Hindu and anti-Bharat sentiments. He frequently publishes content that defames Hindu dharma and goes to the extent of derogatorily labeling every Hindu as \"bastards\". Similarly, he targets Bangladeshi citizens and media outlets that oppose the \"India Out\" activities.\n\nPinaki has garnered popularity among radical Muslims and individuals belonging to the anti-Bharat and anti-Hindu factions in Bangladesh and Pakistan due to his jihadist and anti-Bharat publications. He has allegedly encouraged Bangladeshi Muslims to participate in jihad against Hindus and join jihadist groups operating in Jammu and Kashmir, India. Additionally, he has been reported to praise Hamas for their actions, including attacks on Israelis and instances of violence against Israeli and Jewish girls and women.\n\nIn a recent interview with the Qatari media network Al Jazeera, Rumeen Farhana, the international affairs secretary of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), endorsed the party's involvement in the \"India Out\" movement, asserting that the people of Bangladesh have long harbored discontent over India's interference in their country's politics. Rumeen Farhana alleged that India had exerted extensive efforts to support the ruling regime since 2014. She claimed that resentment towards India peaked in Bangladesh following the resounding victory of Sheikh Hasina's Awami League in the January 7'2023 elections, where the party secured 223 out of 300 parliamentary seats. Critics contended that the electoral process lacked legitimacy due to the opposition's boycott and the presence of numerous independent candidates allegedly backed by the Awami League, raising concerns about the fairness of the election.\n\nAuthorities in New Delhi and Dhaka must take decisive action against Pinaki Bhattacharya, an alleged asset of the Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), who has amassed over 1.6 million followers across various social media platforms. Bhattacharya initiated the #IndiaOut and #BoycottIndia campaign in mid-January, rallying his followers to join what he termed as a \"monumental endeavor\" aimed at expressing love for their homeland and breaking free from perceived constraints. His call resonated with thousands, amplifying concerns regarding his alleged role in spreading jihadist and extremist propaganda.\n\nIt is imperative that appropriate measures be taken against Bhattacharya, and the matter should be brought to the attention of relevant authorities in Paris. Furthermore, complaints should be lodged with social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and X regarding Bhattacharya's exploitation of these platforms for disseminating extremist content. France should expedite the extradition process for Bhattacharya to face justice. Media outlets in Bangladesh, India, and globally must play their part in exposing Bhattacharya's criminal activities.",

        "title": "Oppose the new Cold War on China by opposing every U.S. war",
        "text": "Based on a talk by Sara Flounders to a webinar held on Feb. 18, 2024, Peace Delegates Report Back from China, organized by Friends of Socialist China and the International Manifesto Group. To see the webinar, go to tinyurl.com/2rv6njbj.\n\nWith U.S. wars coming thick and fast, the best way to oppose the new Cold War with China is to be the most militant opponent of every U.S. war.\n\nIf Israel succeeds in crushing Palestinian resistance, based on U.S. financial, political and military support, then U.S. imperialism is stronger on a world scale. That means Palestine fights for all of us. Palestine's resistance has ignited a global resistance.\n\nBefore October 7, Israel, after 75 years of U.S. backing, seemed all powerful. Now the Israeli military has been frustrated at every turn by the indomitable spirit of Palestinian resistance. The Israelis face ambushes without end.\n\nThere is a sea change in the U.S. working class. For the first time, a majority of the population supports Palestine. There is sharp opposition to U.S. policy, shown by mass marches, shutdowns, walkouts. Let's build on this global outrage over the U.S. role as the \"enabler\" of this genocide!\n\nGlobal support for Palestine\n\nOn a world scale, people side with Palestine, whose resistance is our resistance. The liberation of Palestine is an important step in the liberation of humanity.\n\nOctober 7 opened a new chapter in the worldwide class war. The Israeli regime's genocidal crimes against the people of Gaza demand our international solidarity.\n\nFaced with an unwinnable quagmire, the U.S. and Israel have expanded this war. Just this week, they bombed Muslims in Syria, Iraq and Yemen. Three days ago, they blew up two main natural gas pipelines in Iran, leaving millions of Iranians without heat and cooking fuel in winter. This is the way the U.S. and Israel fight wars -- they target essential civilian infrastructure.\n\nThe U.S. and NATO countries cut off all food, medical care and schools to all Palestinians -- even in Jordan and Lebanon, and on the West Bank, by cutting off funding to UNRWA [United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East].\n\nI raise all of this, because the U.S. media and politicians claim they want to protect Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang. The sheer hypocrisy of this claim is blatant. Yet it is the basis of the sanctions! This false charge is a big weapon in the war on China and in lining up and demanding compliance of all U.S. allies against China.\n\nThousands of Volkswagen, Audi, and Porsche cars are impounded on ships at U.S. ports, just because they include a small Chinese electronic part. These German auto corporations are told they must pay U.S. fines, remove the offending part and agree to U.S. charges against China regarding Xinjiang.\n\nBales of clothing made in Vietnam and Malaysia go through isotopic testing at U.S. Customs. If even a thread of cotton comes from Xinjiang, the clothing is destroyed. This is because the U.S. authorities allege there is slave labor in Xinjiang -- even though Xinjiang's cotton industry is fully mechanized.\n\nAnti-war activists need to militantly oppose the wanton use of economic sanctions, which are used against not only China but a total of 40 countries, inhabited by one-third of the world's population. Applying sanctions is a powerful weapon of economic destabilization.\n\nHowever, this is a double-edged sword. Enforcement of these sanctions now widens U.S. isolation. They intensify trade wars with Washington's imperialist \"partners\" -- or are they better called imperialist rivals?\n\nMuch to the frustration of U.S. imperialism, sanctioned countries are finding new roads to cooperation and trade.\n\nViewing China's accomplishments\n\nEveryone on this panel has been to People's China, seen its remarkable accomplishments and returned full of enthusiasm for what is possible.\n\nI've also traveled to Gaza, seen bombed buildings, open sewers and a lack of potable water. Israel has bombed Gaza six times with full U.S. backing since Hamas won elections there in 2007.\n\nI've seen what the Pentagon's calculated destruction did in Iraq -- it was indescribable.\n\nI've seen the impact of U.S. bombing on Syria. One third of the population was turned into displaced refugees. Infrastructure was deliberately targeted. Schools and hospitals were always destroyed.\n\nIt was quite a contrast to see Xinjiang, as I did when on a delegation with Lee Siu Hin. We traveled to the vibrant and peaceful cities of Kashgar and Urumqi. We've seen the lush countryside and prosperous villages. The contrast can't be greater.\n\nStop a Cold War with China; oppose the U.S. /NATO war in Ukraine.\n\nTwo years ago this week, the U.S.-led NATO military alliance appeared to be the most powerful the world had ever seen. NATO members boasted a collective armed force of three million troops, along with the largest array of tanks, missiles and aircraft. NATO claimed its members combined had the world's largest economic power.\n\nFor over 25 years NATO had expanded steadily eastward, to the borders of Russia. NATO seemed unstoppable.\n\nFollowing a 2014 military coup, Ukraine, with full U.S. backing, shelled the ethnic Russian majority areas in its East, along with the Russian border, until Russia responded.\n\nThe leaders of the U.S. and NATO were thrilled with what they saw as an opportunity.\n\nU.S. strategists considered it would be easy to impose regime change on Russia, which would be a key step to their next move -- against China. The most extreme sanctions against Russia were quickly rammed through by every country in the G7. They believed this would surely destroy Russia. \"Regime change\" seemed inevitable.\n\nPresident Joe Biden promised that sanctions against Russia would turn the Russian ruble into rubble within weeks. That didn't happen. Instead, the European Union and NATO alliance is in disarray and experiencing economic crises.\n\nToday, the lines that the Kiev regime's military had held are collapsing. The town of Avdiivka, strategically Ukraine's most important military stronghold, was just abandoned [Feb. 18] in a humiliating rout.\n\nIt is the U.S. that is now bogged down in a new quagmire. According to polls, the majority of the U.S. population now opposes additional funding to Ukraine.\n\nBut the U.S. rulers have learned nothing. They are gearing up for the most threatening confrontation -- now with China. The largest military budget in history just sailed through Congress. Hundreds of line items and hundreds of billions of dollars are focused on countering \"the China Threat.\"\n\nU.S. capitalism, a totally reckless economic system, is by its very nature based on \"expand or die.\" The U.S. economy is totally intertwined with military industries, the greatest source of profit and endless government subsidies for U.S. corporations, which are also endless drains on all social needs.\n\nChina threatens U.S. domination\n\nChina's threat to U.S. domination is real. China's working class is larger than the working class in the U.S. and European Union combined. And its politically conscious leadership is steering in another direction. That is a threat.\n\nChina's very existence as a prosperous, developing country confirms that humanity has another choice. The developing world, the Global South, looks to China -- not to U.S. imperialism. That is a threat to imperialism. To give the world the choice of peaceful development and trade, rather than to submit to economic domination, is a threat to that domination.\n\nBillions of people want new infrastructure -- rather than economic strangulation through sanctions, military invasions, new weapons and hundreds of military bases.\n\nAnyone coming from the U.S. sees that China is beautiful beyond imagination. In the United States, even if we avoid desperation ourselves, we survive while stepping around homeless, desperate people. We see violence every day and have to keep on going. We live in such a violent, edgy, ruthless society that it is a stunning experience to be free of that, even if for just a few days.\n\nI was struck by the level of enthusiasm and energy, enthusiasm for solving problems. The people whom I met in China were far from cynical.\n\nThen, too soon, we returned to the imperialist center. The only way to remain sane is to oppose every U.S. war, to oppose funding endless wars with hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nWe see the relentless military build-up around Taiwan and throughout the South China Sea. But we don't know what will ignite a new crisis.\n\nWe must separate ourselves from the class interests of our class enemy on every front. In this election year, we must break away from the corrupt two-party imperialist system.\n\nChina leads in construction of a new world order!\n\nWe are living through a tumultuous transition from a neocolonial world system, with a ruthless winner-take-all, capitalist world economy, driven by a Cold War mentality. The current economic globalization is not about common development or benefits for all. It follows the law in which only the most brutal forces survive. Currently, inter-imperialist competition is the norm, with endless wars, coups and repeated interference in the internal affairs of nations.\n\nBut another kind of globalization is emerging. The combined Gross Domestic Product of the BRICS (Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa) countries is already larger than that of the U.S. and the G7. What is taking shape is not only economic growth, compared to current Western power, but new forms of exchange and cooperation in the formerly colonized world.\n\nThis new globalization was introduced by Chinese President Xi Jinping, beginning in 2013 with the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\n\nNow emerging is a different kind of world system, focused on trade, development and a more just and democratic global exchange. This new system challenges the geographical division of labor between imperialist core and neo-colonial periphery.\n\nThe goal of BRICS+ and of the Belt and Road Initiative is to develop a more inclusive form of globalization that is beneficial to all.\n\nDeveloping countries need modernization -- but with it they want cooperation and equal participation. China's win-win approach provides a way for peaceful development. It can build partnerships based on dialogue rather than confrontation, to engage in trade, rather than the debt burden of a military alliance. This is a new vision of people-centered development.\n\nChina can launch new road\n\nNothing confirms more clearly the socialist roots of the Chinese economy. Those who run state-owned industries can think, plan and invest long term, without being driven to increase profits each quarter.\n\nCapitalism must expand and must make a profit, or it is out of business. It is relentless. We need to build a new type of political relations among peoples' organizations, here in the West, based on mutual respect, equality, justice and cooperation.\n\nSolidarity and resistance become a material force when they are harnessed.\n\nLet's organize collectively to demand: Hands off China!",

        "title": "Notes on Natural Allies: Applying Orwell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Insights to the War in Gaza",
        "text": "If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never read George Orwell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u009cNotes on Nationalism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d you really should. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s one of his most important and insightful essays. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also one of the most unsettling. If you can read it without questioning your own motives and feeling self-doubt, you must be either a saint or a psychopath. Orwell was describing the 1930s and 1940s, but he also captured the 2020s. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because the essay is about political psychology and what we would today call identity politics.\n\nOrwell called it \u00e2\u0080\u009cnationalism\u00e2\u0080\u009d and talked about the way human beings can feel passionate attachment to, or aversion from, something larger than themselves. That something might be a real nation or might be a race or ideology or religion. Orwell is careful to stress that nationalism in the sense he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s using can be positive or negative. Either way, it warps intellect, corrupts morality, and destroys any concern for truth and objective reality. This is one of the most famous passages in the essay:\n\nINDIFFERENCE TO REALITY. All nationalists have the power of not seeing resemblances between similar sets of facts. A British Tory will defend self-determination in Europe and oppose it in India with no feeling of inconsistency. Actions are held to be good or bad, not on their own merits, but according to who does them, and there is almost no kind of outrage \u00e2\u0080\" torture, the use of hostages, forced labour, mass deportations, imprisonment without trial, forgery, assassination, the bombing of civilians \u00e2\u0080\" which does not change its moral colour when it is committed by \u00e2\u0080\u0098our\u00e2\u0080\u0099 side. The Liberal News Chronicle published, as an example of shocking barbarity, photographs of Russians hanged by the Germans, and then a year or two later published with warm approval almost exactly similar photographs of Germans hanged by the Russians. \u00e2\u0080|\n\nThe nationalist not only does not disapprove of atrocities committed by his own side, but he has a remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them. For quite six years the English admirers of Hitler contrived not to learn of the existence of Dachau and Buchenwald. And those who are loudest in denouncing the German concentration camps are often quite unaware, or only very dimly aware, that there are also concentration camps in Russia. Huge events like the Ukraine famine of 1933, involving the deaths of millions of people, have actually escaped the attention of the majority of English russophiles [sic]. Many English people have heard almost nothing about the extermination of German and Polish Jews during the present war. Their own antisemitism has caused this vast crime to bounce off their consciousness. In nationalist thought there are facts which are both true and untrue, known and unknown. A known fact may be so unbearable that it is habitually pushed aside and not allowed to enter into logical processes, or on the other hand it may enter into every calculation and yet never be admitted as a fact, even in one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own mind. (\u00e2\u0080\u009cNotes on Nationalism,\u00e2\u0080\u009d 1945)\n\nOrwell wrote that at the end of the Second World War, but his words apply perfectly to Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s war on Gaza and the way various groups are reacting to it. Some people rabidly support Israel, some rabidly support the Palestinians. Either way, their partisanship is corrupting their intellect and morality. For example, no pro-Israel partisan is pointing out that the poor persecuted Jewish community is now suffering from what is called \u00e2\u0080\u009cblowback,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the unintended harmful consequences of a scheme to pursue one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own advantage. Jews played a necessary, if not sufficient role, in opening the borders of Western nations to the Third-World invasion by Muslims and other non-Whites. They saw the invaders as \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural allies\u00e2\u0080\u009d against the White Christian West, as they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve often stated in public:\n\nSince October 7, Jews have discovered with dismay that their \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural allies\u00e2\u0080\u009d are in fact their natural enemies. For decades, they encouraged the Third-World invaders to hate Whites and bewail \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhite privilege.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alas, it turns out that the invaders regard Jews as the most privileged and oppressive Whites of all. At the Jew-run Holocaust Educational Trust, you can see Jews fantasizing about non-Whites with a photo of a Black woman dutifully accepting Jewish propaganda about the Holocaust. But the Jew-run Campaign against Antisemitism has to accept the harsh reality about non-Whites when it tweets photos of non-Whites contemptuously rejecting Jewish propaganda about Gaza. In one photo, a Black woman is shown with a sign reading \u00e2\u0080\u009cALL ZIONISTS ARE BLOOD CLARTS.\u00e2\u0080\u009d And what is a \u00e2\u0080\u009cblood-claat\u00e2\u0080\u009d? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a crude Jamaican term literally meaning \u00e2\u0080\u009cblood-cloth, menstrual rag\u00e2\u0080\u009d and extended to mean \u00e2\u0080\u009cdespicable or contemptible person.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOh dear! Non-Whites think Zionists are despicable. Jews should have listened to thought-criminals like me. Back in May 2019 I pointed out possible flaws in their cunning plan to aid themselves and harm Whites with non-White migration. My article was called \u00e2\u0080\u009cHyper-Whites with Hyper-Privilege: Jews Are Losing their Status as Persecuted Victims.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But just as Orwell would have predicted, supporters of Israel can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be honest about Jews being responsible for their own misfortunes or about Jews\u00e2\u0080\u0099 own blindness to Muslim violence. Since October 7, Jews and their supporters have been saying that a \u00e2\u0080\u009cvast crime\u00e2\u0080\u009d has \u00e2\u0080\u009cbounced off the consciousness\u00e2\u0080\u009d of far too many people. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re complaining bitterly that the left have ignored the rapes and other sexual crimes committed by Hamas against Israeli woman.\n\nSheryl and Cherie\n\nI think those complaints are right: the left have indeed revealed the insincerity of their commitment to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbelieving all women.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But the left didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t start ignoring rapes committed by Muslims on October 7. The left have been doing that for decades. The British Labour party has ignored and even collaborated with the rape-gangs of Rotherham and many other British towns and cities. Not only that: Labour opened Britain\u00e2\u0080\u0099s borders to the rape-friendly Third World and ensured that even more rape and sexual exploitation would take place.\n\nYet Cherie Blair, wife of the former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair, has the chutzpah to condemn the pro-Palestine left\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indifference to the crimes of Hamas. Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an article from the Jewish Chronicle, a so-called British newspaper that is deeply concerned about Muslims raping Jews in far-off Israel and doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care in the slightest about Muslims raping Whites right here in Britain:\n\nFormer Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg has questioned the humanity of deniers of Hamas sexual crimes on October 7. The former COO of Meta and Facebook, said she had travelled to the UK with \u00e2\u0080\u009ctwo very brave women to bear witness on what they and their colleagues have seen with their own eyes.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe intention of sexual violence is to generate fear, instead we must generate justice. The unfathomable must not go unpunished, we owe that to the victims of the past, the victims of today, and to prevent victims of the future. If we can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agree that rape is wrong; that rape is not resistance, that rape is [not] freedom fighting, then the question becomes not what is happening in the Middle East but what is happening to our humanity?\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said.\n\nThe remark was made during an event in Parliament hosted by Labour Peer Lord John Mendelsohn. Cherie Blair, who also attended the event, said that she was \u00e2\u0080\u009cashamed\u00e2\u0080\u009d that some people in the UK \u00e2\u0080\u009cdon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to hear\u00e2\u0080\u009d about the allegations of rape just because \u00e2\u0080\u009cit interferes with a narrative.\u00e2\u0080\u009d The barrister and wife of former prime minister Tony Blair noted that she had grown up in the era following the Nuremberg Trials and was \u00e2\u0080\u009cvery proud\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the role Britain played in that, and where the world said, \u00e2\u0080\u0098Never Again\u00e2\u0080\u0099. She said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cBut I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m ashamed it seems like at the moment we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ignoring all that, here in our country people don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to hear that this is happening, because it interferes with a narrative of the \u00e2\u0080\u0098good guys\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and the \u00e2\u0080\u0098bad guys\u00e2\u0080\u0099. But life isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t just good or bad.\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080|\n\nLord Mendelsohn, who was in Israel earlier this month, said: \u00e2\u0080\u009cAll the progress that has been made and all that we have achieved collectively to try and stem violence against women in conflict and the denial of crimes made against them, is at risk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d adding, \u00e2\u0080\u009csince October 7 there has been a major step back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d (\u00e2\u0080\u009cSheryl Sandberg questions \u00e2\u0080\u0098humanity\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of those who deny October 7 rapes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d The Jewish Chronicle, 1st February 2024)\n\nWill Cherie Blair and Jonathan Mendelsohn ever condemn the left for ignoring the rape-gangs of Rotherham? Of course not. If they did that, they would have to condemn themselves. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re at the heart of Labour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pro-Jewish, anti-White elite. The Blairs have become extremely rich by serving Jewish interests and betraying the White working-class. But traitors like them aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t confined to the Labour party: anyone on the left who has supported mass immigration is a traitor to the White working-class. The Third-World invaders have murdered, raped, impoverished, and ethnically cleansed ordinary Whites for decades.\n\nGrovel, goyim!\n\nJews have played a central role in the transformation of parties like Labour in Britain and the Democrats in American from champions of the White working-class to dedicated enemies of the White working-class. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why one section of Orwell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essay needs updating:\n\nZIONISM. This has the unusual characteristics of a nationalist movement, but the American variant of it seems to be more violent and malignant than the British. I classify it under Direct and not Transferred nationalism because it flourishes almost exclusively among the Jews themselves. In England, for several rather incongruous reasons, the intelligentsia are mostly pro-Jew on the Palestine issue, but they do not feel strongly about it. All English people of goodwill are also pro-Jew in the sense of disapproving of Nazi persecution. But any actual nationalistic loyalty, or belief in the innate superiority of Jews, is hardly to be found among Gentiles. (\u00e2\u0080\u009cNotes on Nationalism\u00e2\u0080\u009d)\n\nNowadays Jewish nationalism, in Orwell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sense, is not merely common among gentiles but a prerequisite of political success for gentiles. As I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve often pointed out before: no matter which party is in power, you can be sure that Britain will be ruled by a government of grovelling goys. The Labour leader Tony Blair performed the goy-grovel before Jewish power. He was rewarded with three election victories and then enormous wealth once he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d left office. The Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to perform the goy-grovel and was punished with vilification, electoral defeat, and expulsion from the Labour party.\n\nKeir Starmer, the current Labour leader, is performing the goy-grovel in the expectation of following Blair to the premiership. In the terms of Orwell\u00e2\u0080\u0099s essay, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a nationalist in both the positive and the negative sense. He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pro-Jewish and anti-White. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the already catastrophic levels of Third-World immigration will increase under a Labour government. Yes, Jews are starting to realize that their \u00e2\u0080\u009cnatural allies\u00e2\u0080\u009d from the Third World are in fact their natural enemies. But they still support the Third-World invasion. After all, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always been very bad for Whites, even if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s now proving bad for Jews too. The interesting question is whether, as so often in history, Jews have gone too far and brought about the destruction of their own power and dominance. How does the Hebrew Bible put it?",

        "text": "If the nations of the world-particularly the United States and the Arab countries-wanted to stop Israel's slaughter, torture and ethnic cleansing in Gaza, they could do so tomorrow with suspension of oil, arms and technology imports and exports to Israel. Though \"Free Palestine\" \"and Let Gaza Live\" protesters may shut down bridges, occupy train stations and march by the millions in cities across the globe, key governments-the US, UK, Germany, Canada, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and India- continue to keep commerce humming, monarchies in place and an empire standing even in the midst of what the World Court ruled was a plausible case of genocide. Members of the United Nations would do the world a favor if they followed the lead of South Africa at the International Court of Justice to condemn both in deed and action the crimes of Israel.\n\nFirst the good news.\n\nIn a February press release, seven national unions and over two hundred local unions announced the formation of the National Labor Network for Ceasefire (NLNC) to \"end the death and devastation\" in the Middle East, and to build support for the ceasefire among unions around the country. According to the NLNC, Unions calling for a ceasefire represent over 9 million union members, more than half the labor movement in the United States. The seven national unions include: American Postal Workers Union (APWU), the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA), the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT), the National Education Association (NEA), National Nurses United (NNU), the United Auto Workers (UAW), and the United Electrical Workers (UE).\n\nWhether the NLNC will join CODEPINK, Teachers Against Genocide, Doctors Against Genocide and other organizations on Capitol Hill opposed to President Biden's request for a $95 billion war spending supplemental-$14 billion for weapons for Israel-seems unlikely-though not impossible-in an election year when the specter of another Trump union-busting presidency casts a fearful shadow. The AFL-CIO, representing 12.5 million workers, voted in January to endorse Biden's re-election.\n\nThe NLNC joins the Democratic Party of five states: Texas, Hawaii, New Mexico, Arizona and Washington-and over 40 cities calling for a ceasefire.\n\nUntil recently Italy was responsible for five percent of Israeli weapons purchases-helicopters and naval artillery-over the last ten years. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani claims, however, that Italy stopped all weapons shipments to Israel following that nation's collective punishment of Gaza for October 7th.\n\nIf true, Italy joins Spain and Belgium, which have also suspended arms sales or ammunition shipments to Israel during its bombardment of Gaza.\n\nIn mid-February, a Dutch appeals court instructed the Netherlands to stop sending F-35 fighter jet components to Israel. \"The court finds that there is a clear risk that Israel's F-35 fighter jets might be used in the commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law,\" ruled the court in response to a lawsuit filed by Oxfam and other human rights groups.\n\nThe court ruled the Dutch government had seven days to halt the supply of fighter jets and eight weeks to appeal.\n\nHuman rights organizations, the Global Legal Action Network in the UK and Al-Haq, in Ramallah, have taken legal action against the UK to halt arms sales to Israel totaling over $600-million since 2015, with the UK sending F-35 fighter jets to Israel for its assault on Gaza.\n\nPalestinian rights activists, among them two Israeli dissidents Stavit Sinai and Ronnie Barkan were put on trial in the UK in January after the Bristol-area office of Elbit UK was sprayed with red paint, its windows sledgehammered. Elbit UK is a subsidiary of Elbit Systems, an Israeli-based company that manufactures 500 pound bombs, artillery shells and drones for Israel's genocide Gaza. Sinai, who lives in Germany but flew to England for the protest, said, \"Taking action outside of the country where the crimes are taking place... has been proven to be extremely efficient to exert pressure on the perpetrators.\"\n\nIn an Open Letter (2/5/23) to M\u00e9lanie Joly, Canada's prime minister, over a dozen organizations, including the Anglican Church of Canada, Human Rights Watch and Oxfam Canada, demanded Canada halt its weapons and military hardware sales to Israel that have totaled more than $100 million during the past decade. Canada's foreign ministry insists it has not issued any permits for \"full weapon systems for major conventional arms or light weapons to Israel for over 30 years.\" Ceasefire advocates argue their government is not being transparent about the parts it supplies for missiles and bombs while continuing \"to approve arms exports since October 7 despite the clear risk of genocide in Gaza.\"\n\nChief among those governments that aid and abet Israeli genocide is the United States, which has has a history of raiding the treasury to subsidize its proxy in the oil and gas rich Middle East. According to the State Department, the US has handed Israel's military apparatus over $130-billion dollars since 1948, when Zionist terrorists destroyed over 500 villages, burning some to the ground, to establish a Jewish state on Palestinian land.\n\nThe State Department proudly asserts US subsidies have made the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), known to critics as Israel Occupation Forces (IOF), \"one of the world's most capable, effective militaries ...\"\n\nSince October 7th, the US has supplied Israel with 15,000 bombs, 57,000 artillery shells and one-hundred 2,000 pound bunker busters to penetrate deep underground tunnels beneath apartments, hospitals and refugee camps, turning densely populated neighborhoods into graveyards.\n\nIn a report entitled, \"The Companies Profiting from Israel's 2023-2024 Attacks on Gaza,\" the American Friends Service Committee documents the role of US military contractors in aiding and abetting genocide in Gaza:\n\nRaytheon (RTX), headquartered in Waltham, MA, outfits the Israeli military with air-to-surface missiles for its F-16 fighter jets, as well as internationally-banned cluster bombs and bunker busters. Northrop Grumman, based in Falls Church, VA, furnishes Israel with Longbow missile delivery systems while Lockheed Martin, its main office in Bethesda, MD, supplies Israel with Hellfire missiles, F-16 and F-35 fighter jets, their engine parts maintained by Pratt & Whitney, a Farmington, CT company that in 2015 signed a 15-year contract with the Israeli military.\n\n\"Pratt & Whitney is humbled and honored by the confidence Israeli leadership has placed in us and we look forward to working with local industries to provide continued, long-term support to the Israeli warfighter,\" said Bennett Croswell, president, Pratt & Whitney Military Engines.\n\nA deeper dive into the weapons supply chain suggests China could play a decisive role in stopping the genocide by shutting down production of magnets used in Honeywell-supplied turbo machine pumps and circuit boards for the F-35 fighter jets bombing Gaza. In 2022, the Pentagon-upon realizing the F'35's parts were manufactured in China- placed deliveries of the parts on hold only to reverse itself two days later with a waiver for parts deemed too critical to block.\n\nWhat would happen if US military contractors acceded to the demands of anti-war protesters in Massachusetts, California and Arizona holding demonstrations and die-in's in front of Raytheon's offices? If Congress and the White House pulled the plug on the annual near $4 billion subsidy for the Israeli military? If universities followed through on student resolutions, such as the measure passed at the University of California at Davis, to divest from companies profiting off the Israeli occupation?\n\nSince the US provides Israel with roughly 15% of its military budget, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right coalition might have to rethink their campaign of Palestinian erasure or step up their shopping elsewhere, perhaps in Germany which has increased its weapons exports to Israel tenfold since October 7th, with permit approvals close to $323 million, according to Reuters.\n\nIn June, 2023, a few months before the Hamas raid, on the eve of a normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia, Israel's Defense Ministry reported the country had in 2022 exported over $12 billion in military products-drones, missile, rockets, air defense systems- with almost a quarter of the sales to Arab countries party to the Abraham Accords, bilateral normalization agreements. The Israel Defense Ministry would not identify its arms clients, but signatories and supporters of the Abraham Accords include the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.\n\nMint Press' Minar Adley reports Morocco is building a military intelligence base for Israel in Afso on the border with Algeria, a country that has resoundingly condemned Israel's genocide and pushed the UN Security Council to support a ceasefire. In \"Why Morocco will not cut ties with Israel,\" the Atlantic Council's Sarah Zaaimi argues that despite massive street heat and a Moroccan consulate in Gaza, the government of Morocco will not break with Israel because the relationship is \"a matter of national security for a monarchy that's succeeded in surviving for twelve centuries.\" Elbit Systems, Israel's largest weapons manufacturer, plans to construct two weapons factories in Morocco, while Elbit Systems has established Elbit System Emirates in the UAE to promote \"long term cooperation\" with the Israeli military.\n\nCNN reports that in January the US-under the radar, without fanfare or press -- sealed a deal with Qatar to continue operating for another ten years the US' largest military base in the Middle East. The base that can house up to 10,000 troops Is a \"pivotal hub for the US Central Command's air operations in or around Afghanistan, Iran and across the Middle East.\" Next door, at US naval headquarters in Bahrain, the US Fifth Fleet- stationed in the Red Sea with 7,000 US sailors-takes its cue from a command center.\n\nIndia tops the list as the largest importer of weapons from Israel, accounting for over 40% of Israel's exports, but the relationship is not limited to imports from israel. According to Middle East Eye, India co-produces weapons with Israel while coordinating joint military drills. For Indian leader Nadrendra Modi, a right-wing nationalist bent on violent subjugation of India's 20 percent Muslim population, Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu's brutal treatment of the Palestinians raises few concerns. In fact, Israel's 75-year history of Palestinian erasure serves as a model for Indian nationalists spewing hateful rhetoric, forming lynch mobs and looting and torching Muslim homes.\n\nAlJazeera reports an estimated 130 countries, including Colombia, have purchased drones and spying technology from Israel, though Israel suspended weapons shipments to Latin America after Colombia's left-leaning President Gustavo Petro, a former Marxist revolutionary, declined to condemn the Hamas October 7th attacks, later comparing Israel's destruction in Gaza to the heinous actions of Nazi Germany.\n\nYemen's Houthis launched a solidarity blockade of Red Sea shipments to Israel resulting in an 85% drop in activity at Israel's port of Eilat. Unfortunately, the Answar Allah's demands for a ceasefire and commitment to uphold the UN Convention on Genocide has resulted in US bombings of the impoverished nation's capital Saana, one of the oldest cities in the Middle East.\n\nDespite Turkish President Erdoigan's tough anti-Israel rhetoric, Turkey remains a principal oil supplier to Israel with miles of pipelines that deliver oil from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, suppliers of anywhere from 40- 60% of Israel's oil, through Turkey's port of Ceyhan in the Eastern Mediterranean. Earlier, on October 21st, the tanker Seaviolet reportedly carried one million barrels of oil from Muslim Azerbaijan to Israel's port of Eilat on the Red Sea, though since then Yemen's Houthis have blockaded Red Sea shipments to israel.\n\nSo how is oil reaching Israel now?\n\nBritish Petroleum, which has drilled for oil in Azerbaijan for three decades, is cumventing the Red Sea blockade to ship crude oil via the Horn of Good Hope in Africa, but there's a more efficient solution for those intent on undermining the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide.\n\nMint Press News cites Israel's Hebrew Television Station Channel 13 reports that Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE are together undermining the Houthis' efforts to block the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the passageway to the Suez Canal for a quarter of global trade, including oil to Israel. Rather than reroute ships through the treacherous waters of Africa's Cape of Good Hope -adding a month and a million dollars in fuel to the journey-the four Arab countries have established land corridors, with goods first unloaded at the ports of Dubai and Bahrain, then transported overland on highways from the UAE to Saudi Arabia, then onto Jordan until the cargo reaches Israel via the 115-mile long Jordan Highway overlooking the Dead Sea.\n\nWhile Israel imports almost all of its oil, it also exports crude to Bulgaria, India, Italy, Palestine and Australia, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (EOC), a data visualization tool developed at the MIT Media Lab.\n\nFor months there's been speculation that Israel viewed October 7th as an opportunity to ethnically cleanse Gaza in order to exploit the coastal area's natural gas resources. To grab the goods, however, Israel would first have to remove the Palestinians who might claim title. In keeping with a plan hatched by the euphemistically named Defense Ministry, Israel told a million Palestinians to go south to Rafah for safety, only to bomb residential buildings while ramping up for a ground invasion of the city that straddles Egypt. Palestinian-rights advocates say this \"go south\" edict is to push Gazans further south into the scorching Sinai desert, into Egypt's lap, into tent cities, into an exile reminiscent of the first Nakba in 1948 when Israel drove 750,000 Palestinians from their land to bar them from ever returning.\n\nThe pieces of the puzzle come together.\n\nIn February Israel approved gas exploration licenses to six Israel and international companies for natural gas exploration in Palestine maritime areas off the coast of Gaza. Several organizations-Al Mezan Center for Human Rights and the Palestinian Center for Human Rights-warn Israel it had better cancel those contracts or face the consequences for violating international law. In a world, however, where Israel repeatedly violates international law-including orders from the World Court to stop killing Palestinians and provide massive humanitarian aid -- it's unlikely those contracts will be canceled any time soon unless there is a tsunami of civil unrest or a collective uproar in the 193-member UN General Assembly. Under the Uniting for Peace resolution the General Assembly could with a 2/3rd's vote (129 members) exert enormous pressure by sanctioning Israel and suspending it from UN activities.\n\nInternal dissent rocks Google in the United States, where employees waving Palestinian flags shut down Market Street (12/14/23) in San Francisco to protest Google's Project Nimbus, a 1.2 billion contract with the Israeli military for cloud computing engineered by Google and Amazon. Months earlier, before October 7th, hundreds of Amazon and Google tech workers protested the contract in four cities across the country with signs reading, \"No Tech for Apartheid.\" In an open letter, anonymous employees in 2021 charged the Nimbus contract greenlights \"unlawful data collection on Palestinians, and facilitates expansion of Israel's illegal settlements on Palestinian land.\"\n\nMultinational corporations like Microsoft, Google, IBM and Intel all have offices in Israel. Google's 8,000 square mile campus in Tel Aviv occupies eight floors of Electra Tower, with one floor reserved for Google's \"Campus Tel Aviv,\" a hub for entrepreneurs and start up companies. Hewlett-Packard-a target of the global BDS movement- profits off the Israeli occupation with biometric identification-hand and facial recognition-used at checkpoints throughout the West Bank, where excruciating wait times can take Palestinians all day to reach family in a village 30 miles away.\n\nA boycott of Israel's technology-computers, electronics, cybersecurity software-could send Israel's economy into an inflationary spiral, for high tech contributes 18% of the gross domestic product, employs over 12% of the workforce, accounts for half the country's exports and contributes 30% of the tax base, according to CNN.\n\nIsrael's surveillance technology includes Pegasus spyware that can invade your cell phone, capture text messages and collect passwords, border drones that monitor the movement of migrants across the Mediterranean, thermal cameras that can see through walls during police raids and facial recognition software for cameras at checkpoints and borders.\n\nOne of Israel's biggest trading partners is the European Union, which in 2018 purchased Elbit Systems drones to track and collect intelligence on asylum seekers. Critics charge the use of these drones without offering rescue operations for refugees risking their lives violates the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has long wanted the contracts canceled. Professor Richard Falk, Chair of Euro-Med's Board of Trustees, said the purchase is outrageous considering the \"repressive and unlawful ways\" drones are used to oppress Palestinians in the occupied territories.\n\nIn the UAE, where dissent is outlawed and labor unions forbidden, those who might protest their country's cozy relationship with Israel risk prison and torture, so it's not surprising that the royal family easily welcomed an Israeli tech hub to Abu Dhabi in 2022 and announced plans for a UAE technology institute in Haifa come 2024. \"We will work on some of the most interesting challenges in AI and at the same time contribute to the vision of scientific collaboration articulated in the Abraham Accords,\" writes Yoelle Maarek, the soo-to-be director of the center, who previously worked as an executive at Google, IBM, Amazon, and Yahoo.\n\nAnother top shopper for Israeli tech is India, which, according to the New York Times, bought Pegasus Spyware in 2017 to keep tabs on opponents of Modi's ultra-nationalist regime.\n\nAnd it's no secret that Saudi Arabia is one of Israel's best customers for Israeli tech used to hack the phones and spy on people deemed enemies of the state. Though the planned normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel is off the table for now, Saudi Arabia's 620-billion Public Investment Fund (PIF) continues to invest in Israeli tech start-ups.\n\nThe Israeli military says it's relying on an artificial intelligence-based system called Habsora (the Gospel) to \"produce targets at a fast pace\" in Gaza, where to date Israel has killed over 28,000 and wounded over 68,000 people. Richard Moyes, a researcher for Article 36, a team of policy experts based in the UK, discounts the accuracy of AI algorithms, telling The Guardian, \"We're seeing the widespread flattening of an urban area with heavy explosive weapons, so to claim there's precision and narrowness of force being exerted is not borne out by the facts.\"\n\nIf nations anywhere in the supply chain are serious about ending genocide in Gaza and preventing a wider war, they can invoke the S in BDS and sanction Israel, prohibiting imports and exports of oil, weapons and technology. If the US, Canada, UK, Germany, India and the Arab countries complicit in Israel's slaughter refuse to reverse course-if they insist on aiding and abetting genocide in the face of the International Court of Justice's condemnation and global outrage over Israel's slaughter, then it's time for other countries to expose Israel and its abetters in a criminal tribunal on the floor of the United Nations to put the criminals, from Biden to Netanyahu, on trial for genocide.\n\nUntil that time, CODEPINK joins the global call to the UN General Assembly to sanction Israel as it brazenly violates International Court of Justice orders to stop killing and wounding Palestinians and start providing massive humanitarian aid. Our New York City delegation, which has encouraged countries to file declarations in support of South Africa's case at the ICJ, delivers a strategic message as the delegation visits the UN missions: \"NO MORE WEAPONS, OIL OR TECH FOR ISRAEL.\"\n\nIt may be cliche to say, \"If there's a will, there's a way,\" but the truth is the collective power of the world-or even a sliver of the world-could stop the slaughter tomorrow.\n\n* Marcy Winograd volunteers as the Coordinator of CODEPINK CONGRESS and a co-producer of CODEPINK Radio. She also co-coordinates CODEPINK's World Court Campaign to support South Africa's case against Israel's genocide in Gaza.

        "title": "Oil reports weekly decline on fading US Fed rate cut hopes; Brent settled 3% lower at $81/bbl",
        "text": "Oil prices fell nearly three per cent lower in the previous session and posted a weekly decline after a US central bank policymaker indicated interest rate cuts could be delayed by at least two more months. Federal Reserve policymakers should delay US interest rate cuts by at least another couple of months, said Fed Governor Christopher Waller, which could slow economic growth and curb oil demand.\n\nBrent crude futures settled down $2.05, or 2.5 per cent, at $81.62 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) were down $2.12, or 2.7 per cent, to $76.49. For the week, Brent declined about two per cent and WTI fell more than three per cent. However, indications of healthy fuel demand and supply concerns could revive prices in the coming days.\n\nAlso Read: OPEC+ to support Brent at $80/bbl; ONGC/Oil India placed well on dividend pay, valuations\n\nBack home, on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), crude oil futures due for a March 19 expiry, last settled 0.05 per cent higher at \u20b96,356 per bbl, having swung between \u20b96,344 and \u20b96,498 per bbl during the session, against a previous close of \u20b96,353 per barrel.\n\n-The Federal Reserve has held its policy rate steady in a 5.25 per cent to 5.5 per cent range since last July. Minutes of its meeting last month show most central bankers were worried about moving too quickly to ease policy. Some analysts, however, say demand has remained largely healthy despite the impact of high interest rates, including in the United States.\n\n-JPMorgan's demand indicators are showing oil demand rising by 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) month over month through Feb. 21, its analysts said in a note. \"This compares to a 1.6 million bpd increase observed during the prior week, likely benefiting from increased travel demand in China and Europe,\" the analysts said.\n\n-Gaza truce talks were underway in Paris in what appears to be the most serious push in weeks to halt the conflict in Palestine and see Israeli and foreign hostages released. Ceasefire talks could prompt the market to anticipate an easing of geopolitical tensions, Tim Evans, an independent oil market analyst, said in a note.\n\nStill, tensions in the Red Sea continued, with attacks by Iran-backed Houthi militants near Yemen on Thursday forcing more shipping vessels to divert from the trade route. US energy firms this week added the most oil rigs since November, and the most in a month since October 2022, said energy services firm Baker Hughes.\n\nAlso Read: Fed minutes show officials expressed caution about lowering rates too quickly\n\nCrude oil exhibited notable volatility, experiencing significant gains amidst heightened tensions in the Middle East and favorable US economic data. Ongoing tensions in the Red Sea, fuelled by reported escalations in attacks by Houthi forces on ships in support of Palestine during the Israel-Hamas conflict, contributed to the instability in crude oil prices, according to analysts.\n\nThe US Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a substantial increase in crude oil inventories in the US, rising by 3.5 million barrels compared to an anticipated increase of 3.9 million barrels for the week ending on February 16.\n\n''Despite this surplus, crude oil prices received support, indicating a complex interplay of factors affecting the market. We anticipate continued volatility in crude oil prices. Technical analysis suggests that crude oil has a support level ranging from $77.50 to $76.90, with resistance expected between $78.90 and $79.60. In INR, crude oil is anticipated to find support around \u20b96,460 to \u20b96,390, with resistance levels at \u20b96,590 to \u20b96,670,'' said Rahul Kalantri, VP Commodities, Mehta Equities Ltd.\n\nMilestone Alert!

        "text": "Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday asked the management students of BITS Pilani to undertake case studies of five principles of the Union government's functioning with regards to governance and management of the economy, which she said needed to be highlighted.\n\n\"You should look at a case study as to how India has come out of Covid, faced two challenging wars (Ukraine-Russia war and the Israel-Gaza war) that are happening simultaneously and overcome the Red Sea piracy-related uncertainties to emerge as the world's fastest growing economy,\" the FM told students while inaugurating the BITS Pilani Mumbai Campus at Kalyan in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).\n\n\"It should be an interesting case study how a 'minimum government and maximum governance' model which we have taken up from 2014 has enabled us to be receptive to public suggestions and met the expectations of the people.\"\n\n\"Transparency has been the biggest asset in the government and it is completely rid of corruption. We adopted technology and using technology in every transaction we were able to scale up the digital public infrastructure,\" she said.\n\nShe said case studies may be conducted into the subject of Systems Thinking, wherein the government as a whole thinks like an organisation to improve efficiency; the use of feed back to redress grievances; the output outcome monitoring framework of the government which monitors the outcome of every rupee spent and finally the adoption of Japanese business philosophy of Kaizen for relentless delivery of Government services to the poorest of the poor.\n\nThe FM said the Centre was investing in semiconductor technologies (in terms of manufacturing, designing and packaging) in a big way. \"Today there are 3 to 4 states and probably the 5th one is going to come in next few weeks. Semi conductor investments are greatly supported by the government,\" she said.\n\nStating that \"innovative from India and innovate for India\" was the motto with which the present government had worked, she said that in the latest budget she had announced that there would be a corpus of \u20b91 lakh crore for a special purpose vehicle which would be funding innovations and research & development activities.\n\nShe also praised the educational institution for its pioneering role in nation building.\n\nThis is the 5th campus of the storied educational institution which will house its management school (BITSoM), law school (BITSLAW), and design school (BITSDES).\n\nSpread over 63 acres and with an investment of \u20b91,500 crore, it is a future-ready, all-residential campus designed to accommodate 5,000 students at peak capacity.\n\nKumar Mangalam Birla, Chancellor, BITS Pilani, said, \"At BITS, we stand at the precipice of blending India's rich heritage of education with new-age knowledge systems and modern learning environments. This globally benchmarked campus is a visible marker of India's growing intellectual prowess and a symbol of BITS Pilani's whole-hearted embrace of multi-disciplinary education and innovation.\"\n\n\"I am certain that the new campus will create an enabling environment that sparks creativity, excellence, and collaboration, emerging in the process as a talent factory for New India,\" he added.\n\nWith a vision to work towards a zero-carbon footprint, it has been built on a zero-discharge scheme with 100% recycled water utilisation, energy-saving lighting systems and solar power.\n\nThis digital-first campus has state-of-the-art infrastructure for classrooms, multimedia studios (including video and podcast rooms), and a start-up incubation centre. It boasts of 80% open, aesthetically landscaped lush green spaces, and sports and recreation facilities for students.",

        "text": "New Delhi: Bharat Serums and Vaccines (BSV), a biopharmaceutical company in India, has recently inked an exclusive distribution agreement with MediWound (NASDAQ: MDWD) to introduce NexoBrid, a groundbreaking treatment for severe burns, in the Indian market.\n\nAccording to Dr Sameek Bhattacharya, Head of Burn Unit, RML Hospital Delhi, \"In India, we have about 75 burn units and 26 skin banks to treat burn patients. There have been significant positive changes in the country regarding burn management. We have national programs for the prevention and control of burn injuries. There are different types of burns, including chemical, electrical, hot liquid, and burns from flame. However, all burns are the same as there is a layer of dead tissue on the skin that needs to be removed, so whatever the agent, it can be repaired through surgery or topical creams.\"\n\n\"Burn treatment also depends on skin thickness; in my experience, younger people are more vulnerable to burns as they have thinner skin than the older population. A recent study says about 78,00,000 people get burned annually, including minor burns. Furthermore, there are more than 10,00,000 hospitalisations yearly, and there is a need to reduce this number to improve patient outcomes,\" he further said\n\nThere are three primary types of burns: first-, second-, and third-degree burns. Each degree of burn is based on the severity of damage to the skin, with first-degree being the most minor and third-degree being the most severe. Further, while some burns can be treated at home, severe ones (second and third-degree) require immediate medical attention.\n\nMost burns are treated by cleaning the area with soap and water, followed by dressings and topical creams. Nexobrid (concentrate of proteolytic enzymes enriched in bromelain) is a topically administered biological product that enzymatically removes nonviable burn tissue, or eschar, in patients with deep partial and full-thickness thermal burns within four hours of application without harming viable tissue.\n\nThe cream has demonstrated a significant reduction in time to achieve complete eschar removal and a substantial decrease in wound area requiring surgical excision (surgical need) while demonstrating non-inferiority to SOC in the quality of scars (dead tissues).\n\nProf Lior Rosenberg, also Founder and CMO at MediWound Ltd, Israel said, \"Nexobrid is a paradigm-shifting solution for treating burn victims as it only dissolves the dead tissue and does not impact the skin. It is an effective solution for treating burn victims, especially those who have suffered severe burns. In fact, this cream dissolves into the skin and does not impact the skin's dermis. Since the dermis can heal spontaneously, it is essential to maintain it so that the patient's recovery is faster.\"\n\n\"Every burn victim is keen to reduce the pain and scarring caused by the burn. While burns are traumatic, this cream can be an effective solution as it will reduce the scars and improve patient outcomes. More importantly, since this cream reduces the need for surgery, it automatically reduces blood loss and pain associated with surgery. All in all, this cream will effectively reduce scarring as well,\" Rosenberg added.",

        "text": "\"Narasimha Rao was a Batman of Indian politics, Bharat urgently needed to acknowledge this ratna\", First Post, February 10, 2024:\n\n\"Former Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, in a true sense of the word, was a Batman of Indian politics. He became Prime Minister at a time when India's chips were badly down. In 1991, the country had to pledge its gold to pull the economy from the brink.\n\nHe reoriented India's pro-Soviet Union foreign policy to bring it closer to the Western order. He reached out to Israel without leaving the Palestinian cause -- an axis on which the Indian foreign policy still revolves around. And all this he delivered with a minority government.\n\nSanjaya Baru, in his book 1991: How PV Narasimha Rao Made History, emphasised at this phenomenon, with a tinge of sadness, when he recalled how \"at an interaction with students at a university near Delhi, in the winter of 2015\", he asked the audience \"what the year 1991 meant to them\". One student readily stood up to say he was born that year -- and the entire audience burst into laughter. When Baru insisted on thinking more, there was silence.....\"",

It is also under attack from Hezbollah.\n\nThe Conservative Party MP said the ongoing conflicts between Ukraine and Russia, and in West Asia, are real threats to global security.\n\nCommenting on India-UK trade potential, Braverman said, ''Post BREXIT, UK heralds a great opportunity for UK-India trade deal to double trade worth 86 billion pounds, doubling India's exports and increasing UK investment in India, particularly in sectors infrastructure, renewable energy, healthcare, education. We hope to secure a mutually beneficial UK-India trade deal''. Braverman also said it was incumbent on any self-respecting government to do the needful to protect its citizens.\n\n''Israel has the right to defend herself within the realms, limits of international law, of course. But those calls for an immediate ceasefire are naive and dangerous,'' she added.\n\nBraverman said the war in Gaza ''could stop tomorrow'' if Hamas lays down arms, release the hostages they still hold in captivity illegally, and if the terrorist group commits itself to peace.\n\n''It is not for Israel to unilaterally disarm in the face of the immediate and imminent threat posed by Hamas in Gaza. Humanitarian protection should be provided for civilians,'' Braverman said.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "\"It took Sheikh Mohammed [Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan] five minutes to say 'of course, let's find the right place',\" said Gargash, who also served as the UAE minister of state for foreign affairs from 2008-2021.\n\nSheikh Mohamed bin Zayed (MBZ) was, at the time, serving as the UAE's de facto leader during the ill health of his brother Sheikh Khalifa, the country's then president. In 2022, MBZ became the UAE President.\n\nEarlier this month, PM Modi travelled to the Gulf country to inaugurate Abu Dhabi's first Hindu temple. It was his seventh visit to the UAE. This came a month after he inaugurated a Ram temple in Ayodhya that was built on the land of a demolished mosque.\n\nThough this was the third temple to be built in the UAE, it is the largest in the Middle East built by the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha over a 27-acre site.\n\nIt was first announced by PM Modi during his visit to the UAE in 2018, and a foundation stone-laying ceremony took place a year later.\n\nAccording to Gargash, this was an example of building on a relationship that was previously like an \"untended olive garden\".\n\nThe UAE and India have deepened their strategic and economic relationship in recent years, marked by the signing of a free trade agreement, a slew of reciprocal high-level visits and more.\n\nThe UAE is India's third-largest trading partner, while India is the UAE's second. About 3.5 million Indians live in the oil-rich country and are a source of large remittance inflows.\n\nAlso read: With Modi at the helm, India and the Arab world have become closer than ever. Here's why\n\nWhile speaking about religious extremism in the Arab world, Gargash criticised Yemen's Houthi rebels, who have attacked ships in the Red Sea amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.\n\n\"Houthis are using the Palestinian cause to launder their image...[They] launch as a militia... and then become basically a resistance movement,\" he told the audience.\n\nIran-backed Houthis have been launching attacks in the Red Sea in solidarity with Palestinian group Hamas in Gaza.\n\nIn 2019, UAE forces withdrew from a key Yemeni port, the Hudaydah Port, in order to support a United Nations (UN)-led peace process.\n\n\"The Stockholm agreement said...the Houthis will not run the port anymore; it will be run internationally.... But these parts of the agreement didn't materialise. The Houthis still ran Hudaydah,\" said Gargash.\n\nThe UAE is part of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition against the Houthis.",

        "text": "While the U.S.-Israel alliance has become isolated, new ones are emerging.\n\nHelena Cobban in the Boston Review: Just days before October 7, President Joe Biden's national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, was radiating confidence that Washington had effectively brought all of West Asia's long-roiling conflicts under control. Washington could now, he believed, accelerate the pivot of attention, forces, and funding toward what had long topped Biden's agenda: containing Chinese power in East Asia. Then came the Hamas-led attack on Israel and Israel's onslaught on Gaza. By late January, Sullivan was flying to Bangkok to plead with top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi for help in defusing the sharp, Gaza-spurred conflict that had erupted in the globally vital waterway of the Red Sea. (Wang politely blew him off.)\n\nOver the past four months, the United States has become increasingly isolated on the world stage. In October and again in November, the United States vetoed resolutions at the UN Security Council that called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza on the grounds that they did not condemn Hamas. Then, on December 12, a special session of the UN General Assembly -- where no country has veto power -- voted 153 to 10, with 23 abstentions, in favor of a ceasefire resolution that made no mention of condemning Hamas. Those supporting the resolution included the BRICS group of nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), nearly all the other nations of the Global South, and some West European states, including France and Spain. The only states that joined the United States and Israel in voting against it were Austria, Czechia, Guatemala, Liberia, Paraguay, Papua New Guinea, and the tiny countries of Micronesia and Nauru.\n\nIn late December South Africa brought an impressively documented case against Israel to the UN's highest judicial body, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), claiming that Israel had been committing genocide in Gaza and was likely to continue doing so unless the ICJ ordered it to comply with a set of strict \"provisional measures.\" Biden's Secretary of State Antony Blinken impatiently dismissed the suit as \"meritless.\" On January 26, the veteran (and U.S.-nominated) ICJ President, Judge Joan Donoghue, delivered the court's ruling: it was \"plausible\" to conclude that some of Israel's actions in Gaza since October 7 could constitute genocide, and Israel should therefore comply with six of the nine provisional measures South Africa had requested. Washington issued no comment on the ruling and made no move to condition the \"ironclad\" military and political aid it was continuing to give Israel on the latter's compliance with the ICJ's orders.\n\nToday Gaza stands at the fulcrum of world history. As its people slog on under Israel's unrelenting assault, they have won the empathy and support of the vast majority of the world's peoples. And over the past few months, it has become increasingly clear that the close ties Biden has retained with Israel have gravely damaged the United States' global standing. The actions that the two countries have taken throughout the crisis have posed an increasingly serious challenge to the whole system of governance that since 1945 has preserved, with many lacunae, the global peace. And they have brought the United States ever closer to the brink of a major war in West Asia. More here.",

        "title": "Everyone Wants a Piece of the Moon",
        "text": "Our satellite hasn't seen this many missions since the Apollo era. This time, humanity might be there to stay.\n\nFor the past few days, mission control in Houston has been talking to the moon. It's a throwback to an earlier space age, with a few tweaks. Mission control is not NASA, but a private American company called Intuitive Machines, sending instructions to an uncrewed lander about the size of a telephone booth. The spacecraft made a nail-biting descent to the lunar surface on Thursday, with a last-minute software patch to make up for malfunctioning navigation sensors. One of the spacecraft's legs snagged the surface and the whole thing tipped over, landing on its side. But still: It was the first time an American spacecraft had landed on the moon in more than 50 years.\n\nThe mission is the latest event in what has quickly become the busiest decade in lunar exploration since the 1960s. Government agencies and private companies in the United States, China, India, Japan, Israel, and the United Arab Emirates have all dispatched lunar landers in the past five years, with varying degrees of success. Many more missions, both uncrewed and crewed, are in the works. The U.S., the only country so far that has set people on the moon, aims to repeat the feat as early as 2026, and then start building a sustained presence on the surface.\n\nAll of this activity is driving humankind to a new precipice. The present flurry of moon missions is poised to define the next 50 years of human space travel. In the 1970s, after the triumph of the moon landings, NASA and the Soviet Union turned away from the moon, focusing instead on building space shuttles and stations. But the state of lunar exploration has changed dramatically since Apollo. And this time, instead of swinging back to Earth once again, humankind has an opportunity to launch itself deeper into the solar system, establishing us even more as a spacefaring, possibly interplanetary, species.\n\nSeveral of the new missions -- like Apollo before them -- are run by national governments, including India's and China's. \"The moon is not exactly the milestone that it would have been 50 years ago, but it does signify a level of capability on particular aspiring space powers,\" John Logsdon, a space historian and founder of George Washington University's Space Policy Institute, told me. Whereas the Cold War race involved two mighty competitors, the track is now full of both established and emergent space powers, some working together to explore the moon.\n\nThe space arena is also full of private aerospace companies -- and this is the key difference between our modern moon fixation and the original edition. Firms from Israel and Japan have dispatched spacecraft to the moon, and Intuitive Machines is one of 14 firms that NASA has contracted to deliver various lunar payloads in the coming years. Its lander rode into space on a rocket built by SpaceX, which launches all kinds of payloads at a blistering cadence, serving as Uber for space. \"Even 10 to 15 years ago, those kinds of launch opportunities were extremely rare,\" Asif Siddiqi, a space historian and history professor at Fordham University, told me. SpaceX is also responsible for building the spacecraft that will deliver NASA astronauts to the lunar surface in 2026 through the Artemis program, named for Apollo's sister in Greek mythology.\n\nRead: Not your grandfather's moon mission\n\nThe bulk of moon-landing attempts over the past five years have ended in bits and pieces. That's to be expected: The majority of the entities making these attempts -- whether Japan's national space agency or a NASA contractor -- are doing so for the first time. Yes, technology has come a long way since Apollo, but \"we have new technology available to us that we've never tested in this kind of environment,\" Sue Lederer, the lead project scientist on NASA's program for commercial moon missions, told me. A crash landing is certainly a disappointing setback, but if and when a given team is ready to try again, there are plenty of rides to space available, thanks to companies like SpaceX. The attempts will just keep coming. \"Barring any unforeseen global catastrophe, I don't see that stopping,\" Siddiqi said.\n\nPlus, there's a new motivation fueling private moon missions today: ice, hints of which scientists detected in the 1990s. The Intuitive Machines lander touched down near the moon's south pole, a region of shadowy craters that might harbor water ice. Future explorers could melt that water and run it through life-support systems, or break out its hydrogen and oxygen to produce rocket fuel -- the kind of infrastructure you'd need to support a lunar economy. Mining the moon for water is still an abstract idea; for one thing, science instruments have yet to determine how icy the lunar south pole actually is. Upcoming missions may find little of economic value, Logsdon said. Or they could kick off a full-blown lunar rush.\n\nSo far, our modern moon rush isn't as glitzy as its predecessor. Don't get me wrong: I love the moon. Without it, nothing you and I treasure on this Earth would exist. Still, any Apollo-like program in this day and age is bound to invoke a \"been there, done that\" response, says Logsdon, who witnessed the launch of Apollo 11 in person in 1969. Surveys show that Americans largely believe that NASA should focus more on climate change and monitoring potentially hazardous asteroids. A 21st-century moon landing by astronauts, with the first woman and first person of color, will certainly be front-page news. But unlike Apollo 11, an Artemis landing is \"not going to lead to ticker-tape parades through the streets of Manhattan,\" Logsdon said.\n\nRead: America is trying to make the moon happen again\n\nSpace travel is now merely the mark of an advanced civilization, even when some of its members wish that the richest among them spent less time eying the heavens and more time focused on earthly matters instead. And if you've got to go somewhere, the moon is a good choice. Some of the space community considers the moon to be a proving ground for human missions to Mars -- a giant leap that is much more likely to capture our collective attention. A Mars mission is an enormous challenge, and will be for a long time. But the moon is right there. Why wouldn't we go?\n\nThis decade will be pivotal for our future in space, but it's too early to say exactly where we'll be in 10 years' time. Space exploration is always at the mercy of shifting budgets and political priorities. If you'd asked experts riding the high of the first moon landing about America's next leap, Siddiqi told me, they would have said that astronauts would be on Mars in the 1980s; instead, humans have stayed within Earth's orbit. The Artemis program, for its part, has struggled with technical and budget problems, but it has a certain momentum, and the success of the newest lander, a precursor to sending people, has only added to it.\n\nRead: Too much of a good thing at NASA\n\nAlthough he knows that historians can get such predictions wrong, Siddiqi doesn't think the world will slip into another lunar lull. \"We're in a very different stage of our interaction with space,\" he said. In the years since Apollo, humankind has dispatched robots across the solar system, built gigantic space telescopes, and become comfortable living in the weightlessness of the International Space Station. Humans themselves have not traveled beyond the moon, but with the current lunar frenzy, our future as an off-world species feels more within reach than ever before.",

        "text": "A weekly selection of opinions and analyses from the Arab media around the world. Niqab crisis will strike Egypt sooner or later\n\nAl-Ahram, Egypt, February 17\n\nFor more stories from The Media Line go to themedialine.org\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1919 revolution, Egypt witnessed a series of profound changes that reshaped the country's trajectory. The 1923 constitution marked a pivotal moment, ushering in a new era of liberalism and emphasizing the importance of citizenship. These developments had a particularly significant impact on Egyptian women, who transitioned from the confines of the harem to embrace the possibilities of modernity.\n\nThis shift in women's status reflected the depth of societal transformation occurring in Egypt. The role of women in shaping modern history has been a consistent theme in our nation's history, underscoring Egypt's vitality and its commitment to progress. The strength of a society is often measured by the degree of gender equality it achieves in public life and political engagement. Egyptian women have long fought for their rightful place in society, advocating for advancements that reflect their indispensable contributions.\n\nThe active participation of Egyptian women in the 1919 revolution marked a turning point in their political and social empowerment. This period saw women transition from a state of passivity and dependence to one of self-assertion and autonomy. As society embraced change, women played a crucial role in driving societal progress, challenging conventional norms, and paving the way for a more equitable future.\n\nWomen's liberation efforts extended beyond symbolic gestures, such as discarding traditional garments like the niqab, to a broader push for education and socio-political inclusion. Educated women embarked on a transformative journey, venturing into rural areas to teach and inspire younger generations of Egyptians.\n\nSociety gradually embraced the idea of women pursuing higher education, enabling them to stand on equal footing with men in the pursuit of knowledge. This collective awakening led to the establishment of the Egyptian Feminist Union, a testament to women's growing influence and agency.\n\nDespite these advancements, a historical regression began in the mid-1970s, as political Islam gained prominence and sought to undermine women's rights under the guise of religious piety. Insidious tactics were employed to enforce practices like wearing the hijab, perpetuating harmful stereotypes, and curtailing women's freedom of choice. The insidious coercion tactics employed by some extremist preachers highlighted the systemic challenges facing Egyptian women in reclaiming their agency and autonomy.\n\nThe rise of conservative ideologies led to a resurgence of strict dress codes, with the niqab becoming increasingly prevalent in both urban and rural areas. This cultural shift, aligning with extremist viewpoints, posed a stark departure from earlier norms and values. The erasure of women's identities in the political sphere, evidenced by the dehumanizing practice of labeling female candidates as mere symbols, represented a dangerous erosion of women's agency and individuality.\n\nHowever, the spirit of resilience and determination among Egyptian women remains steadfast, transcending the obstacles posed by regressive forces. History has shown that setbacks are temporary, and women continue to make strides in various fields, from government positions to artistic endeavors. The legacy of pioneering women like Safiya Zaghloul, Huda Sha'arawi, Nabawiyya Musa, and Saiza Nabarawi serves as a beacon of hope, inspiring future generations of Egyptians to uphold the values of equality and empowerment.\n\nThe challenges facing Egyptian women today are daunting, but their unwavering commitment to progress and empowerment will ultimately prevail. Indeed, Egyptian women continue to shatter glass ceilings and redefine societal expectations. Their voices resonate across literature, research, and international platforms, embodying the resilience of Egyptian women in the face of adversity. - Tariq Al-Hariri\n\nIndia: A growing maritime power\n\nAl-Ittihad, United Arab Emirates, February 16\n\nThe Indian Navy has bolstered its presence in the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea in response to recent crises impacting global shipping and trade. These crises disrupted the trade route extending from the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean via the Red Sea, a critical international shipping corridor accounting for 12% of global trade.\n\nIn the wake of these disruptions, the Indian Navy conducted more than 12 rescue operations, showcasing India's growing maritime power and its willingness to assist during times of crisis. While the primary objective was to protect Indian vessels, the Indian Navy also responded to distress calls from vessels of other nationalities under attack by drones and missiles in the Red Sea.\n\nDespite international efforts to combat piracy, this threat has reemerged, posing a risk to trade from Europe to Asia, particularly in the waters off the coast of Somalia, including the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden. As a result, India is prioritizing actions to combat piracy in these regions.\n\nIndia is actively collaborating with regional and international navies to enhance maritime security in the Indian Ocean. The Indian Navy has intensified maritime surveillance in the central and northern Arabian Sea through increased deployed force levels and aerial surveillance using long-range patrol aircraft and a remotely piloted aircraft system.\n\nIndia's coordination with allied nations aims to strengthen monitoring, threat detection, and support for international ships in distress. India's distinction from regional competitors is exemplified by its recent assistance to Pakistan, despite strained relations. Last month, the Indian Navy rescued 19 Pakistani nationals aboard a hijacked Iranian-flagged fishing vessel, apprehending 11 pirates after firing warning shots to deter further aggression.\n\nIndia's maritime initiatives align with its aspiration to be a regional power ensuring security in both domestic and international waters. The country's burgeoning economic growth complements its growing global influence, exemplified by its proactive maritime security efforts. India's commitment to freedom of navigation underscores its readiness to utilize its maritime power for collective benefit, demonstrating an unwavering stance against obstruction of sea lanes. Notably, India refrained from joining the US-led coalition in the Red Sea to maintain strategic independence, a cornerstone of its foreign policy. Despite close ties with the United States, India's strengthening relations with Russia underscore its status as an autonomous global actor.\n\nIn light of the disruptions to exports and energy imports caused by piracy, India remains resolute in combating maritime threats, reaffirming its commitment to safeguarding its interests and providing aid to other nations in crisis. The need for accelerated naval modernization to meet India's expanding strategic maritime requirements is evident, despite existing challenges. The Indian Navy's amplified international presence and enhanced focus on providing security underscore its growing impact as a significant player in maritime security operations. - Zikru Al-Rahman\n\nIs it time for a deal on the Lebanon front?\n\nAn-Nahar, Lebanon, February 15\n\nOn Oct. 8, 2023, Hezbollah unilaterally declared war on Israel, citing support for the resistance in Gaza and a desire to ease pressure on the Strip. After 131 days of intense fighting along the Lebanese-Israeli border, Israel suffered significant losses, with dozens of soldiers and civilians killed or wounded, military sites destroyed, and a weakening of its deterrence capacity. Hezbollah also faced casualties, with more than 200 fighters and several civilians losing their lives, and widespread destruction of residential and commercial areas in border villages.\n\nDespite the prolonged conflict, Hezbollah's goals for the war remain unmet. The battle in Gaza rages on, with ground operations advancing into key cities like Khan Yunis and Rafah, raising concerns about the aftermath of the battles. As Hamas's grip on the Gaza Strip weakens, questions arise about Gaza's future governance, reconstruction prospects, and regional stability post-Hamas rule.\n\nPromises of eradicating Israel within minutes or liberating Jerusalem have proven hollow, exposing the limitations of Tehran-led rhetoric and Hezbollah's influence in the region. The reality diverges sharply from Iran's decades-long propaganda campaign, which exploited Arab populations with false promises of resistance. Internal dissent in Iran, particularly in urban centers, highlights growing disillusionment with the regime's oppressive tactics and ideological manipulation.\n\nIn Lebanon, the war underscores Hezbollah's failure to achieve its stated objectives, as casualties mount, resources deplete, and the nation reels from economic strain and institutional decay. To overcome this crisis, Lebanon must separate itself from the Gaza conflict, pursue an immediate ceasefire, and recommit to UN Resolution 1701.\n\nA comprehensive approach involving border negotiations, military reconstruction, and expedited gas exploration initiatives is needed to stabilize the country and pave the way for peace and prosperity. Lebanon must swiftly exit the vortex of conflict and chart a path toward recovery and reconciliation. - Ali Hamada\n\nTranslated by Asaf Zilberfarb.",

        "text": "Indian origin British Conservative MP and former Home Secretary Suella Baverman claimed to be a proud child of British Empire and global Indian diaspora.\n\nSpeaking on Day 2 of ABP Network's at 'Ideas of India' Summit 3.0 in interaction with Indian Congress MP Shashi Tharoor, Suella countered sharp questions while Dr. Tharoor pointed out many Indians would feel more than a tinge of pain at the reality of empire having been essentially denied on hearing that Indian is a proud child of an empire.\n\nSuella Baverman on Israel\n\nThe Conservative Member of Parliament for Fareham and British Former Home Secretary, Suella Baverman sharing her views on \"The World in Ferment Closing Borders, Brutal Wars\" took a stand on the Israel Hamas war said \"Israel has the right to defend itself as per International law. But those who call for immediate ceasefire are na\u00efve and dangerous.\" She demanded Hamas disarms, frees all hostages, and commits to peace for a ceasefire. \"Israel cannot unilaterally declare ceasefire when faced with an imminent threat by Hamas,\" said Suella.\n\nGiving a context of the global geopolitics in 2024, Suella remarked, \"With over 60 general elections around the world, including India, US, and UK, there is opportunity for democracies like UK and India to collaborate on the world stage.\" She further commented on India UK trade potential and claimed that post BREXIT, UK heralds a great opportunity for UK India trade deal to double-trade worth 86 billion pounds, doubling India's exports and increasing UK investment in India, particularly in sectors infrastructure, renewable energy, healthcare, education. We hope to secure a mutually beneficial of a UK India trade deal.\"\n\nSuella on new espionage laws in UK\n\nSuella defended the new espionage laws in UK to overhaul outdated espionage and national security laws. \"We have made framework more nimble and agile to counter emerging threats from hostile countries like China, Russia, and Iran,\" said the forme British law maker. She also made her stance about immigration clear and said \"We are challenged by unprecedented illegal migration. In 2022, we had 45,000 people crossed the English channel illegally.\n\nThey were leaving a safe country like France, undermining border security. It's a humanitarian challenge. The British people are frustrated to see that in the southern borders,\" and further added that UK has enviable track-record of welcoming migrants. \"We welcomed 500,000 people from Ukraine, Syria, and other nations extending sanctuary to those needy. Last year, net migration into UK was 700,000 that was an increase of 200,000 in 2019 legally. This migration pace is not sustainable considering the resources. Our NHS, school education system are under strain due to rapid increase in population,\" claimed Suella.\n\nSuella on upcoming elections in UK\n\nSpeaking about the challenges faced by the UK Conservative Party in the upcoming elections, she said \"Labour party winning would be a disaster with regards to economics and national security in UK.\" She denied institutional racism in UK. \"I don't believe that Police in UK is institutionally racist, which would otherwise smear a lot of good people. Black Lives Matter and Left Wing activism\" insisted the conservative MP.\n\nBraverman's origins trace back to India, where her parents migrated to the UK in the 1960s. While her mother, originally from Mauritius, had a Hindu Tamil background, her father, hailing from Kenya, is of Goan descent. A Conservative Party leader and legal expert, she entered the UK Parliament in 2015 and is known for her controversial views on an array of subjects.",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Indians for Palestine, a group of concerned citizens, which convened a public meeting here on Friday, February 23, called upon the Indian government to publicly endorse the latest ruling of the ICJ, stand against all violations of the human rights of Palestinians in Gaza and refrain from any sort of complicity with Israel.\n\n\"We demand an immediate ceasefire in Palestine.\n\nWe further call on people across Asia to demonstrate collective solidarity with the people of Palestine - in spirit, resources, speech, and action,\" said a resolution passed by the meeting, which saw a packed hall in the capital's Constitution Club.\n\nThe meeting was held to understand the implications of the crucial ruling of the 'The International Court and Justice for Gaza' (ICJ), and extend solidarity and support to Palestine\" said a press statement released by the citizens' collective, which includes leaders of political parties, the media, the legal fraternity, the international diplomatic community, activists, students, and the public.\n\nAmong those who addressed the gathering were senior lawyer Anand Grover, former ambassador K.P. Fabian, journalist Siddharth Varadarajan, and political leaders, including Dipankar Bhattacharya, Asaduddin Owaisi, Amarjeet Kaur and Subhashini Ali.\n\n\"The session began with an introductory note by the moderators, Jean Dr\u00e8ze and Ayesha Kidwai. This was followed by a recording of Arwa Abu Hashhash, a Gazan citizen and representative of the Union of Palestinian Working Women's Committee and the Palestinian People's Party, who said language was incapable of describing the horror of the massacre that is taking place in the Gaza strip today\" said the release.\n\nAdnan Abu Al Haija, the Palestinian ambassador, highlighted how none of the resolutions passed by the United Nations have been implemented. He acknowledged the solidarity expressed by South Africa, Colombia, Chile, Bolivia, Brazil, Ireland, Belgium, and Spain.\n\nThe meeting noted that the daily death rate in Gaza was higher than any other major 21st-century conflict.\n\n\"The total deaths have surpassed 29,000. This does not even include the irreversible long-term impacts of this massacre on the population of Gaza: deepening of poverty, severe crisis in water availability, the shutdown of healthcare systems, and chronic and intergenerational trauma,\" it noted.\n\nAnand Grover said South Africa's courage was missing from other countries, especially India. KP Fabian said that standing with Palestine means standing for justice, and pointed out how the international community was allowing the genocide to continue despite the extensive broadcasting of the horrors.\n\nSiddharth Varadarajan highlighted the complicity of the current Indian government with Israel's ongoing genocide, while Congress leader Salman Khurshid endorsed the stance of Indians for Palestine and called for an immediate.\n\nmarjeet Kaur (AITUC) said while the Modi government may be with Israel, the Indian people were with Palestine \"as indicated by the dock workers who refused to load weaponised cargo being sent to Israel.\"\n\nSubhashini Ali (CPI-M) said that \"this war is not of religion, but of\n\nimperialism and that a post-colonial country like India should stand with Palestine; the struggle for Palestine is a struggle for India's democracy\"\n\nDipankar Bhattacharya (CPIML-Liberation) accused the Modi government of implementing the Israeli blueprint against farmers and dissenters, according to the release.\n\nRepresentatives of all parties endorsed the call for an immediate ceasefire and also passed a resolution that can be read below:\n\nRESOLUTION AND STATEMENT OF SOLIDARITY INTERNATIONAL COURT AND JUSTICE FOR GAZA: A PUBLIC MEETING ON THE ICJ RULING (New Delhi, 23 February 2024)\n\nBy January 11, 2024, the daily death rate in Gaza was higher than in any other major 21st-century conflict. The death toll in Israel's ongoing assault on Gaza has now crossed 29,000, most of whom are women and children, with over 70,000 Gazans wounded. Among those killed are approximately 85 journalists and media workers, 152 UN workers, 600 health workers and 12,000 children. The long-term impacts of this continuing massacre go far beyond the immediate casualties: deepening poverty, severe water crisis, the shutdown of healthcare systems, and chronic trauma. According to international experts, the victims of starvation and disease in Gaza may exceed the number of those killed directly during Israeli attacks.\n\nOn January 26, 2024, in response to South Africa's application against Israel for violating the Genocide Convention in its attacks on Gaza, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Israel must \"take all measures within its power\" to prevent such actions. This ruling is of historic significance because it is for the first time that the world's highest court has held Israel culpable for its violations of international human rights laws concerning Palestinians. In this regard, the ICJ has deemed the arguments from South Africa as substantiating a plausible claim of genocide.\n\nThis landmark order of the ICJ also imposes a moral and legal obligation on other country members of the ICJ and signatories of the Genocide Convention, including India, to cease funding or facilitating Israel's military actions. The signatories to the Genocide\n\nConvention are obligated to prevent genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, incitement to commit genocide and complicity in genocide. They risk transgressing the Convention if there is no reprimanding of, or suspension of economic-cultural-social relations with Israel - a member country now being tried for genocide. Such is the devastation already caused by Israel's actions that there is a moral responsibility on all signatories to the Convention to unequivocally oppose Israel's continuing onslaught.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa declared in a statement on 8th February that given his country's legacy as a nation that has fought and defeated Apartheid, it has a particular obligation to stand up for the rights of people everywhere. It is crucial to remember that India's position has also been one of opposing Apartheid.\n\nGiven this shared stance, we are dismayed to note the Indian government's passivity on the issue and its refusal to forthrightly condemn Israel's inhuman assault on Gaza and Palestinians in the West Bank. Unlike many other countries in the Global South that are re-assessing their relations with Israel, India continues its close collaboration with it, particularly in the defence and surveillance sectors. It is deeply disturbing, for instance, to learn from recent media reports that amid Israel's ongoing war on Gaza, twenty Hermes-900 military drones produced jointly by Adani-Elbit Advanced Systems India Ltd. have been sent to Israel for possible deployment in Gaza. Many other Indian companies are also involved in subsidized joint ventures with Israeli weapons manufacturers.\n\nThe Indian government is also facilitating the recruitment of Indian workers in replacement of Palestinian workers whose work permits are now suspended. This move is objectionable not just in its support of Israel's decision against Palestinian workers but also in its indifference to the possible dangers facing Indian workers being sent to Israel. The Indian government has further played into the hands of Israel by suppressing all attempts to protest against the unfolding genocide in Gaza.\n\nWe thus call upon the Indian government to publicly endorse the latest ruling of the ICJ, stand against all violations of the human rights of Palestinians in Gaza and refrain from any sort of complicity with Israel. We demand an immediate ceasefire in Palestine.\n\nWe further call on people across Asia to demonstrate collective solidarity with the people of Palestine - in spirit, resources, speech, and action. We particularly welcome the recent decision of the Water Transport Workers Federation of India - representing 3,500 workers at 11 major Indian ports - to refuse any cooperation with the loading or unloading of \"weaponized cargoes from Israel or any other country which could handle military equipment and its allied cargo for war in Palestine\". Many other steps can be taken to express support for Palestine, including the submission of photo/video evidence of ongoing war crimes (accessed through verified accounts of Palestinian journalists) through the online portal of the International Criminal Court. We should not be left behind as mass protests are sweeping across the world.\n\nStand for Palestine! Stand for Humanity! Ceasefire Now!",

        "title": "RUSSIAN WORLD Navalnyj's death and the triumph of propaganda",
        "text": "The eagerness to insert himself into global power struggles is not just a personal propensity of Putin's, but somehow a typical characteristic of Russian nature, which needs to find self-confirmation elsewhere, so as not to loose itself among the forests and steppes of its boundless territory.\n\nThe second anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine is celebrated by Vladimir Putin with the most radical and definitive propaganda move, that of wiping out all forms of opposition. With the death in a lager of Aleksej Naval'nyj, the only real opponent of the last twenty years, the month of the election campaign for the fifth re-election on 17 March was inaugurated, from which the only non-aligned candidate, Boris Nade\u017edin, was also conveniently eliminated.\n\nBoth removals were widely expected and unnecessary for the success of the dictatorship's triumph, largely established since the tsar's second-third re-election, but they appear decidedly useful for the only Victory that interests the collective Putin, that of the Great War of the Russian World.\n\nThe World Election War 2024 had already become apparent on 13 January in Taiwan, scoring a point against mainland China's historical enemies. On 7 February, Azerbaijan instead opened the series of farcical re-elections of tyrants, with Ilham Aliev's fifth term in office at 92% of the vote, a ritual explicitly linked to victory on the ground, the reconquest of Nagorno Karabakh at the expense of Armenians.\n\nFollowing this, on 25 February, we now have the discounted re-election of Aleksandr Luka\u0161enko in Belarus, who, to be on the safe side, has had all the assets of his opponents from four years ago, now in prison or abroad, seized, auctioning off their homes, just in case anyone thinks of going back.\n\nThe two post-neo-Soviet leaders are, after all, only the valets who open the curtains of the royal box of Tsar Putin, who will reach the quarter-century mark without even having to face adversaries, not even on the surface, given that poor Nadezhdin has had his signatures on the registrations contested, as written in unworthy handwriting, and accompanied by even more shameful predictions, as if he wanted to take 20% of the votes and reduce the plebiscite consensus to the Kremlin's godfather.\n\nOn 1 March, the Assembly of Experts, Iran's parliament, will be 'renewed', again to add a laudatory chorus to the Putin re-election on 17 March, for which great popular festivities and proclamations of universal victory are expected.\n\nBetween April and May, it will be Narendra Modi's turn to collect the bulk of the votes of almost a billion voters in India, in the 'largest democracy in the world' increasingly similar to the regimes of its large Eurasian neighbours.\n\nIn June it will be the turn of four hundred million Europeans for the renewal of the parliament in Brussels, and it will be one of the moments in which to begin to draw the sums of the great war, leading up to the final battle of the Anglosaksy between November and December, with the clash of the American 'patriarchs' Biden and Trump, and the probable early elections in England.\n\nOn the outcome of the big elections will also depend to a large extent the evolution of the war scenarios, in Ukraine and Israel above all, depending on the prevalence of more or less pacifist alignments and the orientation on which sides to support or condemn.\n\nThe Kremlin is therefore not just watching from afar, but considers these formal calls for democracy as real calls for mobilisation, in an increasingly hybrid and multifaceted war on a universal level.\n\nAn example comes from Indonesia, where artificial intelligence was used to clean up the image of candidates, and mobilise deceased politicians to send messages to voters. In recent days, the French watchdog agency Viginum, specialised in defending against foreign digital interference, has highlighted a network of almost two hundred Russian websites engaged in propaganda of the Kremlin's theses in the West, called Portal Kombat, structured and coordinated to target the Internet audience in Europe and the US, and in all the countries that support Ukraine.\n\nPutin does not only want to conquer Ukraine, or Moldova, which may soon be invaded in its turn, but he intends to dominate ('save') the whole world.\n\nUkrainian intelligence then gathered information about the beginning of an active phase of Russia's cyber-warfare that has allegedly already begun, named Perun after the greatest pagan deity of ancient Rus', whose idol was thrown into the Dnepr by Prince Vladimir as a symbolic gesture of the Baptism of 988. In this way, Russia reaffirms its 'holy battle' for the true faith, rejecting the false values of the idolatrous West.\n\nThis campaign involves the involvement of foreign journalists, media personalities and bloggers to support, in all latitudes and in all applications, the reasons for the aggression against Ukraine and Russia's salvific mission in the world.\n\nThe resounding start of the Perun was the interview granted by Vladimir Putin to the American Tucker Carlson, in which not surprisingly the Russian president went on to recall the exploits of the leaders of Rus' since the century before the Baptism of Kiev, starting with Oleg 'the seer' who attributed to Kiev the title of 'mother of Russian cities', and because he was a seer, he knew that this honour was destined to reach as far as Moscow.\n\nPutin himself later confided that he was 'disappointed' by Carlson's excessive condescension, who asked him almost no questions about anything, let alone objections.\n\nOne has to make sure that one believes in the existence of a world 'real debate', so as not to fall into ridicule as in the case of the interview, in which the servile submission of the American highlighted the clumsiness of the leader, who got caught up in the eagerness to identify the characters of ancient history with his current enemies, the Ukrainian 'neo-Nazis' who started the 'civil war' in 2014, so much so that he regrets not having started the invasion earlier to restore the original unity.\n\nThe paradox is that Putin even went so far as to sympathise with Hitler, blaming the Poles for the start of the Second World War to which the Nazi leader was allegedly 'forced', just as Stalin 'had to correct' Lenin's grave mistake, presented as 'the inventor of Ukraine'.\n\nThe eagerness to insert himself into power struggles all over the world, after all, is certainly not just a personal propensity of Putin's, but somehow a typical character of Russian nature, always in need of finding elsewhere the confirmation of its own existence, so as not to disperse among the forests and steppes of its boundless territory.\n\nPeter the Great intended to make Russia the 'real Europe', proclaiming himself king of Sweden and Poland, and spying as a young man on the sessions of the House of Lords in London, at the invitation of William III of Orange.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Tsar Nicholas I, called 'the gendarme of Europe', did everything in his power to defend the principle of autocracy even among his enemies, such as Ottoman Turkey, or the 'great Latin heretic', the Pope of Rome Gregory XVI, whom the Tsar visited privately at the Quirinal Palace in 1846, asking him not to give in to liberal suggestions.\n\nOne of the Russians most passionate about foreign elections was the great writer Lev Tolstoy, representative of Russia's liberal and pacifist soul, but no less involved in the great games of War and Peace.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the supreme Russian novelist continually expressed his wish for America to choose 'the right president', and US Republicans were very concerned about the great influence Count Tolstoy could have on the American electorate, publishing articles against his exhortations, which were considered 'moral degradations'.\n\nThe future president Theodor Roosevelt, who in 1886 was New York's chief of police, always walked around with a copy of Anna Karenina to reread during stakeouts and operations, writing in a letter to his wife that Tolstoy 'never comments on the actions of his characters, whether they are good or bad... it is a manner of narration without morality, if not directly immoral'.\n\nThe whole of America avidly read Tolstoy's novels, each of his books became a best-seller and provoked heated discussions. At the time, the 'women's question' was being discussed, and Russians and Americans were scandalised by the excessive openness in European countries, while Tolstoy was in the vanguard of the demands for new rights, so much so that he was officially excommunicated in his homeland, and in the USA the publication of Sonata a Kreuzer was banned according to an 1873 law condemning 'indecent, perverse or lustful' books.\n\nEven Resurrection, Tolstoy's most anti-clerical novel, was admitted with severe cuts by the American censors, \"according to the principles of bourgeois morality\", as warned in the preface, arousing strong protests from the author.\n\nAmerican readers showered the writer with letters, anticipating the avalanches of social commentary of today, and groups of visitors and pilgrims from America came to the Jasnaja Poljana estate.\n\nTolstoy was the most 'Americanophile' character in Russian history, and he certainly turned in his grave upon hearing his great-great-grandson, the current Russian deputy Petr Tolstoy, call his daughter's period of study in America his 'terrible sin' and a kind of 'global guilt', in a total reversal of the 'eternal war of values' front.\n\nAlso visiting the count in 1903 was William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic candidate defeated in 1896 by Republican William McKinley.\n\nBryan was a famous populist orator, known as the 'Great Common Man' to whom Donald Trump himself is compared today, and in 1900 he again tried to win an election by opposing paper notes 'in the hands of the banks' to defend the 'gold standard', but lost again despite large rallies in which he posed the crucifix 'for the defence of the people'.\n\nMore than one hundred and twenty years later, Russia, America and Europe are once again at loggerheads, searching for gold and lost values. The outrage over the assassination of Naval'nyj compels all leaders, parties and factions of public opinion in all countries to take sides, making Russia the only global homeland in which to decide what future we want to build.",

        "text": "NEW DELHI: Bharat Serums and Vaccines (BSV), a biopharmaceutical company in India, has recently inked an exclusive distribution agreement with MediWound (NASDAQ: MDWD) to introduce NexoBrid, a groundbreaking treatment for severe burns, in the Indian market. According to Dr Sameek Bhattacharya, Head of Burn Unit, RML Hospital Delhi, \"In India, we have about 75 burn units and 26 skin banks to treat burn patients. There have been significant positive changes in the country regarding burn management. We have national programs for the prevention and control of burn injuries. There are different types of burns, including chemical, electrical, hot liquid, and burns from flame. However, all burns are the same as there is a layer of dead tissue on the skin that needs to be removed, so whatever the agent, it can be repaired through surgery or topical creams.\"\n\n\"Burn treatment also depends on skin thickness; in my experience, younger people are more vulnerable to burns as they have thinner skin than the older population. A recent study says about 78,00,000 people get burned annually, including minor burns. Furthermore, there are more than 10,00,000 hospitalisations yearly, and there is a need to reduce this number to improve patient outcomes,\" he further said There are three primary types of burns: first-, second-, and third-degree burns. Each degree of burn is based on the severity of damage to the skin, with first-degree being the most minor and third-degree being the most severe. Further, while some burns can be treated at home, severe ones (second and third-degree) require immediate medical attention.\n\nMost burns are treated by cleaning the area with soap and water, followed by dressings and topical creams. Nexobrid (concentrate of proteolytic enzymes enriched in bromelain) is a topically administered biological product that enzymatically removes nonviable burn tissue, or eschar, in patients with deep partial and full-thickness thermal burns within four hours of application without harming viable tissue. The cream has demonstrated a significant reduction in time to achieve complete eschar removal and a substantial decrease in wound area requiring surgical excision (surgical need) while demonstrating non-inferiority to SOC in the quality of scars (dead tissues).\n\nProf Lior Rosenberg, also Founder and CMO at MediWound Ltd, Israel said, \"Nexobrid is a paradigm-shifting solution for treating burn victims as it only dissolves the dead tissue and does not impact the skin. It is an effective solution for treating burn victims, especially those who have suffered severe burns. In fact, this cream dissolves into the skin and does not impact the skin's dermis. Since the dermis can heal spontaneously, it is essential to maintain it so that the patient's recovery is faster.\" \"Every burn victim is keen to reduce the pain and scarring caused by the burn. While burns are traumatic, this cream can be an effective solution as it will reduce the scars and improve patient outcomes. More importantly, since this cream reduces the need for surgery, it automatically reduces blood loss and pain associated with surgery. All in all, this cream will effectively reduce scarring as well,\" Rosenberg added.",

        "text": "Horror stories about solo women travellers\u2019 experiences with Couchsurfing inspired Rashvinda Kaur to start the Host a Sister Facebook group\n\nThe group has more than 550,000 members, who offer each other places to stay, companionship on visits, and local insight\n\nI was 18 years old when I first travelled independently: a short camping trip to Parashar Lake, in Himachal Pradesh, India.\n\nAt first, finding myself alone more frequently than I had foreseen, I was disappointed \u2013 many solo female travellers on Instagram raved about their experiences, after all.\n\nSo, like any other oversharing teenager on the internet, I took to social media to rant. And that is when a stranger popped into my DMs to tell me about Couchsurfing, which offers introductions to travellers who just want to socialise with locals as well as those looking for a bed \u2013 or couch \u2013 for the night.\n\nI morphed into an adventurous, carefree teenager and found someone to meet up with, through Couchsurfing\u2019s \u201chang-outs\u201d section, on my next solo trip, to McLeod Ganj, Dharamsala, also in Himachal Pradesh.\n\nA few years later, I would bump into a fellow female traveller in a remote Himalayan valley who told me something I had already realised, if I\u2019m being honest: \u201cCouchsurfing has become the Tinder for travellers.\u201d\n\nI wish this chance meeting had happened earlier, so 18-year-old Avantika could have avoided a far-too-pushy 24-year-old man in McLeod Ganj.India\u2019s toilets are dirty, and unusable for women. There\u2019s a smart solution\n\nHeart racing, fighting back tears while trying to get away from a large man in a strange city, way past dark, young Avantika had managed a quick, polite, \u201cI\u2019m OK, thanks\u201d, before half running towards a guest house, glancing over her shoulder every few minutes. She cried herself to sleep that night and swore to never even consider sleeping on a stranger\u2019s couch again.\n\nMy experience wasn\u2019t as bad as some, and an ever-growing catalogue of horror stories recounted by women who have used Couchsurfing inspired Rashvinda Kaur, a Malaysian entrepreneur based in New Orleans, in the United States, to offer an alternative.\n\nKaur had come across a Facebook post by a woman who had been sexually assaulted by a male Couchsurfing host that encouraged other women to share similar experiences, some of whom offered their own homes as safe spaces.\n\n\u201cI have never Couchsurfed before, so I was shocked to know that this is the reality of the app for female users,\u201d says Kaur.\n\nCouchsurfing was conceived by American Casey Fenton and launched as a website in 2004, but increasingly, the concept has divided the travel community into two polarising sides: one (mostly men) sings the praises of a platform that has helped millions travel far and wide on a shoestring budget; the other (mostly women) recounts stories of psychological, emotional and sometimes physical violence and abuse.\n\nFacebook groups and subreddits are dedicated to such crimes and the 2023 documentary Bad Host tells the stories of three women who were raped by their Couchsurfing host, an Italian police officer, and how they fought together for six years to see justice.\n\nIt was this spirit of sisterhood Kaur found on the Facebook thread that inspired her to establish Host A Sister, in May 2019, the aim of which is \u201cto band female travellers from all over the world to help each other to carry on exploring the world\u201d. Her Facebook page now has more than 550,000 women members, most offering female travellers a place to stay, a meet-up in their home city or a buddy with whom to explore a foreign land, all on a voluntary basis.\n\nThe group is moderated by 12 volunteers in different time zones who each spend two or three hours a day overseeing the group. Bella Ross, who lives in Nashville, Tennessee, in the US, was one of the site\u2019s first.Backlash from a US city\u2019s Airbnb ban hits property sales and house prices\n\n\u201cI believe in what Host A Sister represents to women around the world,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is a different, safer way to travel, knowing that our sisters come together to create this safe space.\u201d\n\nHost A Sister members include Kirsi Asposalo, who opened her home in Finland to female strangers for dinner on Christmas Day 2023.\n\n\u201cThrough the group I have learned that hosting is a way for people to give kindness into the world, and feel good about themselves in the process,\u201d says Kaur. \u201cIt is a way for them to step out of their comfort zones.\u201d\n\nActs of kindness by the group have included women opening their homes to others during humanitarian crises such as the 2022 repeal of Roe v Wade \u2013 which overturned the constitutional right to an abortion in the US, where some states still allow terminations - and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\u201cWe actually came to know about the Russian invasion through the group,\u201d says Kaur. \u201cWithin 48 hours of the war breaking out [in February 2022], there were thousands of posts from women all over offering food, accommodation and even transport to refugees.\u201d\n\nOne Facebook post at a time, I realised that trusting a stranger online can lead to positive experiences. I finally broke my \u201cno strangers\u2019 couches\u201d rule in November 2023, during a month-long trip to Sri Lanka. Not only was I hosted, I also found two other women landing in Colombo on the same day as me.\n\nMy host was Mariyan Malki, who has a room to rent in a small house in Sigiriya, in Sri Lanka\u2019s Central Province, a village known for the Sigiriya Lion Rock, an ancient rock fortress recognised by Unesco as a World Heritage site.\n\n\u201c[My partner and I] have been hosting through Couchsurfing for nearly five years and have hosted over 350 people,\u201d says Malki. \u201cWe have met some really nice people who were easy-going and grateful at the same time. But the majority were difficult to deal with because they expected a hotel-like space with all the facilities and would even complain about a lot of things.\n\n\u201cHost A Sister is a more reliable platform because, through Facebook, the guest and the host can transparently connect and get a sense of the nature and the background of [each other] before the visit, which is a very important factor for me as a woman.\n\n\u201cAs a host also I can openly write about what we can offer and what type of personalities are welcome.\u201d\n\nWith taking turns to drive our self-drive tuk tuk, finding ways to placate our taste buds after shared spicy meals and looking out for each other, Sri Lanka turned out to be quite the adventure for me and my newly acquired sisters.\n\nOne of them was Saf\u00e9 Khiari, a Tunisian sales representative living in France.\n\n\u201cTravelling with these lovely ladies in Sri Lanka inspired me to host other sisters and bring that spirit of travelling, sharing and discovery back home,\u201d she says.\n\nHowever, even for a cause as noble as Host A Sister, online conflict is not uncommon. When the bombardment of Gaza began, after the October 7 attack on Israel, Facebook group members started offering to host either Israeli women or Palestinian women only, keyboard warriors making it especially difficult to moderate the group, according to Kaur.\n\n\u201cSo many people started reporting the group for hate crimes that we were on the brink of getting suspended. I had no choice but to disallow any posts about the Israel-Palestine issue at all.\u201d\n\nEnsuring safety for pet sitters or home swappers and dealing with guests and hosts who cancel at the last minute are other issues that members of the group regularly confront. As is managing expectations of would-be travel buddies.\n\n\u201cSetting up good communication through a WhatsApp group ahead of meeting up and being clear about budgets and things you\u2019d like to do can be effective ways to avoid disappointment when travelling with strangers,\u201d says Giulietta Boakye, a Ghanaian-Italian human resource worker who was joined by a Singaporean and a Nigerian-Belgian she met through Host A Sister on a trip to Finland.",

        "title": "The China factor in the Red Sea",
        "text": "Express Opinion | Houthi attacks on the Red Sea: India needs to take a stand\n\nOver the last two decades, China has been expanding its footprint in the Middle East. The Beijing-brokered Saudi-Iran deal last year further established China as a significant player in the region. The optics of China playing an effective mediatory role between long-time adversaries was seen as the beginning of a power shift, with Beijing replacing Washington as a more reliable mediator.\n\nBoth the US and UK have urged China to press Iran to rein in Houthi attacks in the region, a clear recognition of Beijing's influence in the region. China has nurtured closer ties with Iran as a counterweight to US influence in the region. By actively mediating a solution to the Red Sea crisis, China could project itself as a responsible global power, garnering trust and influence in the region. This could potentially eclipse US efforts, presenting China as a viable alternative to American leadership.\n\nMoreover, the Israel-Hamas war and the Red Sea crisis have served as a strategic distraction for Washington, diverting its attention away from the Indo-Pacific. This distraction has facilitated China's own geopolitical manoeuvres in the South China Sea. China has stepped up its military intimidation of Taiwan and the Philippines since November 2023. The more the US and EU are consumed by the Middle East crises, the more opportunity China will get to increase its dominance in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThough Houthi attacks have severely disrupted Chinese trade and made this route vulnerable for Chinese maritime vessels, Beijing has avoided direct military involvement or condemnation of Houthis, unlike the US and UK. Washington and London have been carrying out strikes at Houthi targets in Yemen in retaliation to attacks on Western commercial ships in the wake of the Hamas war. The US retaliatory strikes were condemned by important stakeholders, including Turkey and Russia, both of whom highlighted Israel's attack on Gaza as the root cause of the escalation in the Red Sea. In such an environment, the Chinese neutrality seems strategic. It allows China to maintain good relations with Iran, a potential mediator while avoiding being seen as aligning with the West in support of Israel.\n\nBesides, China has adopted a cautious approach to the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict. By criticising Israel's action in Gaza and lending outward support to South Africa's landmark case against Israel in the International Court of Justice, China has aligned itself with Arab sentiments. China's advocacy for a Palestinian state has widened space and avenues for its influence in the region. Such a stance would further strengthen China's already significant economic ties with Arab states and Iran.\n\nHowever, China needs to be cautious of overplaying its hand in the Red Sea crisis. Despite Chinese pressure on Tehran to reign in the Houthis, the Yemeni group has refused to back down or de-escalate its attacks in the region. This indicates two things, both of which don't augur well for China's influence in the region. First, it may signal China's limited influence over Iran, and second, it potentially exposes Tehran's inability to control Houthis. Pressuring Tehran might not, therefore, guarantee a change in Houthi actions. The unabated Houthi attacks would thus equally compromise China's economic interest in the region and beyond.\n\nThe failure of China on this diplomatic front may severely dent its image and credibility as a major player in the region. While the US, with its robust power projection capabilities, can intervene militarily against the Houthis at will, China's military presence in the region is limited. Though China has a base in Djibouti, its ability to intervene effectively is still questionable. As a result, China is forced to rely on diplomacy or partnerships, and failures on the diplomatic front can potentially expose its limited influence and undermine its strategic calculus. Moreover, the complex dynamic of the Middle East can easily derail China's balancing act. China's overreach of the Palestinian cause will further sour its relations with Israel which is a key trading partner.\n\nThe Red Sea crisis, thus presents a complex opportunity for China. While the strategic potential to expand its influence in the Middle East and reliably undermine US dominance is undeniable, significant challenges remain. China's overreliance on diplomacy seems unlikely to deliver. With a limited military presence, it will be difficult for China to effectively intervene and safeguard its economic interests in the region, should the Houthi attacks continue.",

        "title": "Business could steer India and the world out of troubled waters",
        "text": "A version of this article appeared in the Spring 2020 issue of strategy+business.\n\nHaving grown up in India, I remember how monsoons brought relief from scorching heat and produced lush greenery and lots of bugs. But as a visitor to India this past August, I saw water scarcity woven into the fabric of day-to-day life and puzzled over those capricious rains. How can the same sort of monsoons be linked to both floods and droughts, not only across the country but even within a state? In Maharashtra, India's largest state economy, drought and flooding coexist within 150 miles. This phenomenon is adding to rural India's agricultural crisis. Meanwhile, in megacities such as Delhi, people queue up to collect just one bucket of water, business school graduates quit their jobs to market rainwater harvesting systems, and the government cracks down on the water mafia.\n\nIndia isn't alone. Middle East countries such as Qatar and Israel are highly water-stressed, as are other countries, such as Chile and Botswana. Cities around the world, including S\u00e3o Paulo, Cape Town, Beijing, London, and Miami, are also struggling with water shortages. India does, however, stand out for its peculiarity; it gets upward of 1,000 millimeters (39 inches) of average annual rainfall, more than double the amount of almost any other water-stressed country. The magnitude of India's crisis is also mind-boggling. According to estimates (pdf) published by the government's think tank, NITI Aayog, 600 million Indians are facing acute water scarcity, and 200,000 people in India die every year because they lack access to clean water.\n\nWhat's behind India's water emergency? NITI Aayog's 2019 report (pdf) points out that most states are mismanaging their water resources, adding credence to the view that human-caused factors have a lot to do with India's water crisis. That's a sobering thought -- but also good news. A problem caused by or worsened by humans can potentially be solved by humans.\n\nIt's also true that an inefficient agricultural sector, made up of millions of small farms, is consuming more than 80 percent of India's water resources. Farming uses up a lot of water globally. But thinking of the water crisis as just a farming issue would be a mistake. In high-income countries, industrial activity accounts for 59 percent of water use. That means that if emerging economies such as India continue to become more industrialized and pursue their development needs in a business-as-usual way, water shortages might worsen, because both industry and farming would need water.\n\nIt's up to business to connect the drops. Water deficits jeopardize industrial growth, energy production, agriculture modernization, and food security. And the cumulative effects of water scarcity are startling; the World Bank estimates that in vulnerable regions, water scarcity could cut economic growth rates by as much as 6 percent of GDP. Some businesses are already using their skills and resources to lead initiatives that will create a more water-secure future. They're generating new revenue streams from water-smart technologies and reducing operational risk by using water more efficiently. But to truly tackle the water crisis in ways that mitigate societal and business risk and unlock new market opportunities, companies will have to go beyond incremental improvements. They will have to deploy innovative business and financial strategies to become stewards of water, and shift how water is used and managed by industry and agriculture.\n\nHere are some emerging practices that suggest how a few companies are beginning to do just that, in India and elsewhere.\n\nBanking on \"blue\"\n\nU.S. estimates of how much investment is needed for water security and infrastructure between now and 2050 cite eye-popping numbers in the trillions of dollars (pdf). But investing in water is not an easy proposition. Water is the lifeblood of societies and, therefore, water-related investments must be managed with care and in collaboration with affected communities and their governments. This might help to explain why investors have held back. In India, most impact investments go to the financial-services sector, thanks in part to the history of microfinance in the country, which means needs such as safe water and affordable housing are neglected.\n\nFortunately, new approaches are emerging to help direct capital toward \"blue\" opportunities. The two-year-old WaterEquity impact fund, which has US$60 million in assets and the star power of actor Matt Damon behind it, is scaling water investments in India, Indonesia, Cambodia, and other countries. It offers loans at concessionary rates to microfinance institutions and promising small enterprises that, in turn, serve the water and sanitation needs of people, especially women, who often are responsible for water-reliant tasks and therefore are affected most by water shortages.\n\nAnd because water risk threatens financial stability, big banks and institutional investors are beginning to drive systemic change by thinking differently about lending decisions. According to a recent World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) study (pdf) endorsed by the Indian Banks' Association, businesses with high water risk account for 40 percent of the total credit exposure of Indian banks. Financial institutions are in a position, therefore, to push for water risk management as a condition of lending.\n\nCorporate investors and venture capitalists are stepping up investments in solutions such as Internet of Things-based smart water meters, solar-powered desalination equipment, and atmospheric water generators. But technology alone is unlikely to solve this crisis. That's why it's encouraging to see the growth of innovative financing mechanisms offered by financial institutions. In the U.S., Goldman Sachs has invested in a $25 million environmental impact bond issued by the District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority. This municipal bond is funding nature-based infrastructure such as rain gardens and permeable pavements to slow stormwater surges, and investors earn bonuses linked to the performance of the project. In the U.K., Anglian Water issued Europe's first green bond related to water, arranged by Dutch bank ING. Through the bond, the water utility has raised more than $322 million, which is funding water conservation and management projects.\n\nRejuvenating wetlands\n\nCompanies are beginning to get behind efforts to restore the world's freshwater ecosystems. Rejuvenating wetlands, in particular, is starting to receive a lot of attention at the policy level in India. Wetlands are water-saturated lands, such as swamps, marshes, wet prairies, and mangroves, that support distinct ecosystems. They naturally regulate the availability of water, absorbing it during floods and releasing it in dry periods. But years of unplanned development and land degradation have reduced the ability of India's wetlands to retain water. The disappearance of wetlands around the world is contributing to the hydrological extremes of droughts and floods.\n\nThese are among the many good reasons that telecommunications and technology company Nokia is funding community-driven wetland conservation programs in Bangalore. There's one more: Bangalore is home to one of Nokia's four global research and development centers. To the rest of the world, Bangalore is India's Silicon Valley, but to its tech-savvy citizens, Bangalore is a place skating dangerously close to Day Zero -- the day water runs out.\n\nNokia is helping restore wetlands in the Bangalore Rural District in partnership with the district government, local panchayats (village councils), small businesses, and the WWF. The WWF reports that the Nokia-sponsored Bashettihalli wetland in India has reestablished connections with upstream wetlands thanks to rigorous data gathering and analysis, mapping of less disruptive supply chains, and improved water management practices at the basin level.\n\nHSBC's water program, to which the global bank has contributed $150 million over the past eight years, also focuses on wetlands, including the world's largest one: South America's Pantanal. The Pantanal garnered the world's attention recently when massive wildfires hit it, close on the heels of the Amazon forest fires in Brazil. But millions of people who live in the Paraguay River basin were already acutely aware of how dams, deforestation, and agriculture have put the Pantanal ecosystem under severe stress. The seven-year-old Pantanal Pact, whose participants include 25 municipalities, local and international nongovernmental organizations and businesses, and civil society, has been working to improve watershed management through conservation measures and advocacy in the region.\n\nThe benefits of rejuvenating wetlands are many; their vegetation captures carbon and acts as a natural buffer to climate change -- which is widely accepted as a phenomenon that's exacerbating water scarcity. A global pledge to protect wetlands, called the Ramsar Convention, has been in force since 1975, but meaningful action has been slow. Rejuvenating wetlands has business benefits, too. Improved watershed management will make water-stressed environments where companies operate more resilient. As businesses get behind these efforts, protecting and restoring wetlands could become a mainstream endeavor.\n\nScaling small solutions\n\nLarge-scale change is needed to create a water-secure future, and market forces are helping drive this change in certain industries. For instance, India's biggest industrial users of water -- coal-fired power plants -- are struggling with repeated shutdowns, adding greater momentum to the big-picture shift toward solar- and wind-powered renewable energy.\n\nBut global businesses are also seeing the need for smaller-scale solutions. Water scarcity affects people in the communities where they operate their supply chains, bringing issues such as groundwater depletion to their attention. Underground aquifers are drying up all over the world. In India, the world's largest user of groundwater, the water table has fallen to alarmingly low levels because of rampant, unplanned extraction by both the agriculture sector and urban development.\n\nThis is why ITC Limited (pdf), a global consumer goods business headquartered in India whose portfolio includes branded packaged foods, is helping recharge groundwater where the company and its supply chain operate -- reporting 40 percent improvement in those areas. It's doing this by organizing farmers into water user groups to help them manage their own local water resources. This effort combines traditional and modern solutions. ITC is helping farmers revive traditional floodwater and rainwater harvesting structures such as community tanks and earthen embankments. In parallel, it's working with the same farmers to improve water-use efficiency with techniques such as micro-irrigation. ITC's initiatives span 16 states and involve 320,000 farmers, showing that businesses can harness the collective power of countless small efforts to make a big impact.\n\nSimilar efforts are underway in other parts of the world. Water is a business risk for Swedish clothing retailer H&M; two-thirds of its 500-plus suppliers are based in water-stressed countries. The company is not simply reducing its water footprint in its own operations but going well outside the fence line to influence small changes in many other locations. In Bangladesh, Turkey, and China, all home to thriving textile-export industries, H&M is running education campaigns on clean water and sanitation, mobilizing investments for cleaner production techniques, and engaging with policymakers on water management issues.\n\nDespite some companies taking the lead, there is a long way to go. Unlike wider climate change risk, which now gets a lot of attention from both investors and companies, water-related practices are not well understood or reported. Last year, almost 7,000 companies disclosed their climate change-related information, mainly greenhouse gas emissions, to the international nonprofit CDP (formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project). In contrast, just 2,114 companies (pdf) disclosed data about their water management.\n\nCompanies need to explain how they are accelerating their progress toward achieving water sustainability for their own financial stability and reputation, and for the greater good of societies. It should no longer be optional. Governments and civil societies are pushing companies toward water audits, demanding they meet benchmarks for water use, and asking that companies disclose their water footprint.\n\nThe spillover effects\n\nThese new requirements are coming as policymakers rethink economic models in the face of economic slowdown and environmental stress. For example, there is momentum behind new trade and investment policies designed to transition economies to a low-carbon path while creating new jobs.\n\nAchieving and maintaining a higher level of water security could also have significant spillover effects. Within India, water security has the potential to strengthen the struggling farm economy, boost rural incomes, and create jobs at a time of high unemployment. On-the-ground interventions such as water harvesting require manual labor, and technological innovations harness the skills of entrepreneurs, scientists, and engineers. And all of these solutions need established businesses to fund and implement them.\n\nSuccesses in India, with its unparalleled scale of crisis, could offer lessons to a world that risks missing number 6 of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals: ensuring safe water and sanitation for all. And failure to act and make changes on a global scale could leave billions of people in dire need of clean and safe water. By making every drop count, business can make the difference between success and failure.",

Dubai and its fellow Emirates in the UAE are ruled by family dynasties, not by democracy.\n\nWe in the West don't mind that, of course, because the UAE largely dislikes our enemies and likes our friends, and Sheikh Mohamed of Abu Dhabi's (and therefore the UAE's) ruling House of Nahyan is an enthusiastic partner in the fight against radical Islamism, and even maintains relations with Israel.\n\nLife is, in the grand scheme of things, half-decent for its inhabitants too. Emirate-born Arabs, who tend to work for the government, earn the sort of money that most of us would rather like, and the majority population of south-east Asian immigrant workers make more than they would at home.\n\nStories of awful mistreatment of those immigrant workers are never far from your search engine, yet we turn a blind eye to that, not least since those workers vote with their feet by choosing to work there, even though they cannot do so with a pencil thereafter.\n\nOur approach to Saudi Arabia is not entirely different. As I sat watching the live TV function on my Emirates flight last week, I switched on BBC World News and the first thing I saw was President Joe Biden fist-pumping Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman.\n\nIt was a physical manifestation of the geopolitical reality that producing 10 million barrels of oil every day and providing the most important regional counterbalance to Iran outweighs the murder and dismemberment of Jamal Khashoggi, the dissident journalist.\n\nPresident Biden is hardly alone. Dozens of the world's top golfers have provoked outrage amongst their peers by joining the LIV Golf tour, bought and paid for by the House of Saud.\n\nThe players, many of whose best days are behind them, are receiving pay-days of the sort they have never enjoyed, with a guarantee that they can never lose their playing card (relegation, in effect).\n\nBut some of those criticising their erstwhile colleagues have some issues with consistency, since they played in the money-spinning Saudi events on the DP World Tour (and, yes, the 'D' is for Dubai). They're not the only ones. Anthony Joshua, Britain's pin-up heavyweight boxer, will try to win his world titles back, for the second time, in Saudi Arabia, next month.\n\nAnd motor racing's Formula 1 takes its circus there annually, just after its trip to Bahrain. It returns to China soon.\n\nSo, where does the world draw the line? With Russia, it seems. Formula 1 pulled the plug after Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. As did tennis's Wimbledon and, of course, football's FIFA, which has banned Russia from its World Cup (in, er, Qatar).\n\nI have, myself, drawn a line there in the past; a few years ago I declined my one and only request to appear on Russia Today to discuss Scotland's constitutional psycho-drama.\n\nWhy do we draw the line at Putin and Russia? We, the West, have other allies (or, at least, regimes we tolerate) which are authoritarian. Which persecute journalists. Which kill their own people. Which oppress women and girls.\n\nWe presume that by bringing them into our tent; by trading with them and allowing them to participate in the global order, we are buying an insurance policy against them doing anything which risks that order.\n\nSo, when they start a war with one of our friends, with a country which escaped socialist authoritarianism after the fall of the Soviet Union and embraced Western capitalist liberal democracy, we draw the line.\n\nWould we do the same if Pakistan took the decades-long skirmishes with India to the next level? Or if Saudi Arabia decided to murder a BBC journalist? What if China's President Xi takes a leaf out of Putin's book and decides to test the US's limits in protecting Taiwan?\n\nMuch as we might like geopolitics to be black and white to fit within our personal moral borders, it isn't. It is devilishly complicated. And, as we enter this post-Covid era of global economic difficulties, and as national self-interest plays an increasingly leading role in countries both democratic and undemocratic, it will only become more so.\n\nA good time, then, for strong but thoughtful, clear but considerate global leadership to guide us through these choppy waters. Say what you will about Presidents Reagan and Clinton but they had a global plan, and matched it with global action. Prime Ministers Thatcher and Blair left controversial legacies at home, but abroad they made their mark in an impactful way.\n\nWho do we turn to now, during a time arguably more unstable than those navigated by those predecessors?\n\nPresident Biden's qualification for the job is not being Donald Trump. The European Union's leaders have shown themselves unprepared to fully punish Putin, because such is their dependence on his gas that in so doing they would punish their own country's financial security.\n\nHere in the UK, Conservative MPs and, thereafter, members of the Conservative party, are choosing our next Prime Minister; the person who will create policy on all these complex matters for one of the world's leading soft powers, with a good amount of hard power, too.\n\nWe are hearing a lot about Brexit. About tax. About gender recognition. About nationalism. But not about foreign policy. Not about how and where we draw lines.\n\nIt's a shame, that. We - all of us - need to be led. We need the brightest minds with the clearest thoughts to help us tread this rocky path, to know who are our friends and who are our enemies, and why.\n\nMorally, we need that. And practically, we need it too - every time we pay a heating bill, or fill our car with fuel, it should be a stark reminder that taking our eye off the geopolitical ball can have meaningful consequences.\n\nIt's far from clear that any of the world's top-tier leaders are equipped.",

        "title": "Cook these: Jamie Oliver's meat-free meals",
        "text": "FAMED for making home cooking approachable and achievable for millions of people, and for lobbying for better children's public health, Jamie Oliver's influence doesn't seem to be wavering - even 20 years on from the Naked Chef first appearing on our TVs.\n\nHis restaurant chain may have recently gone into administration in the UK, but a few months on, he's \"moving on, dusting down\" after a \"very, very painful\" time and focusing on his next venture - and this time it's plant-based.\n\nSo is the man who brought us the 'insanity burger' turning off meat altogether? \"No. No way Jose!\" Although a self-confessed meat-lover, it might surprise you to learn that he eats meat \"probably only twice a week\" these days.\n\nHis new Channel 4 show Meat-Free Meals and cookbook Veg feel bang on the zeitgeist. It's no coincidence that social consciousness around food is changing; we all know that cutting down on meat is better for the environment, as well as for ourselves.\n\n\"Yes it's trendy at the moment, that's cool,\" Oliver, 44, says, as if pre-empting any assumptions that he's jumping on any bandwagons. He wrote (and shelved) this book eight years ago, in fact. \"I could be wrong but I hope that now is the time to go quite hard and mainstream on veg,\" he says, and in true Jamie Oliver style he's determined to normalise it, to get all of us cooking it, all of the time.\n\n\"We've made it [vegetarianism] more faddy than it needs to be. Veg has been depicted as quite a divisive thing, like football, gangs,\" he muses. \"Vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian - what are you? But it doesn't really matter how you look at it, humans are absolutely deficient in veg, legumes and fibre.\n\nThe new TV show sees Oliver travel to countries where veg is often front and centre of the cuisine, like India and Israel. \"Meat has always been an expression of progress, it's always been a luxury or a sense of cash or commerce - but when you haven't got much of it, humans are beyond genius,\" he says, on the food he discovered travelling. \"The diversity of textures and colours, for really affordable - onions, carrots - everyday things like pickles and fritters, things that give you the same hugging feeling as a burger or a pizza. You're kind of sitting there going, 'I don't want any [meat], I'm really happy'.\"\n\nHe even visits a meat-free school: \"The idea of schools going veggie is a brilliant idea - it would save loads of money.\"\n\nOliver says he wanted to go back to focusing on \"Monday to Thursday eating, busy working people\" for his Veg cookbook (which is incidentally 30-40% vegan), and it certainly harks back to the style of 30-Minute Meals and 5-Ingredients.\n\nIt's not rabbit food though. \"It's a celebration, not commiseration,\" says Oliver. There's heartiness (crispy cauliflower katsu), comfort food (Indian-style chip butty), nutrient-dense (veg tagine) and naughtiness (cheesy kimchi toastie) and 'Friday night nibbles' for the end of the week. \"For me it's a relief! I'll pour myself a little whiskey maybe and I want to have something fun to nibble on,\" Oliver says of his Friday nights.\n\n\"It's about making it simple, delicious and as good as it can be, I'm not trying to give you the best,\" he adds, ever the realist. \"I'm trying to write recipes that are car crash-proof; OK so you chopped it really badly - that's cool, chop it badly.\"\n\nHe doesn't want busy people to open the book and think: \"'Well I'm never going to do that, not until the weekend'.\"\n\nIt's why he's a big fan of using frozen food, particularly veg. \"Frozen is the future,\" Oliver declares. \"The science of freezing has never changed, it's just that we've always frozen a lot of s***. The chances are that your frozen pea will be more nutritious, and in better condition, than your fresh pea that's been sitting in a warehouse for a week.\n\n\"If you care about higher welfare, cheaper price - frozen. If you care about lack of waste - frozen. Convenience, portion control, nutrition - frozen.\"\n\nIn recent years, Oliver's recipes haven't been without controversy though; he was once criticised for using chorizo in a paella and last year 'Jamie's jollof rice' attracted thousands of comments, many claiming he was 'appropriating' a traditional West African dish.\n\n\"I just think that food can be political, it can be divisive,\" he says. \"I learned to make the best hummus I've ever had from theoretically one of the best hummus makers on the planet - and there was at least 300-400 comments that went really dark and really political. We were in the West Bank, Israel, so you've got to be really careful.\"\n\nPolitically speaking, Oliver has never been one to shy away; is he planning to lobby new Prime Minister Boris Johnson on child public health? \"Always!\" he declares - and there's a long list apparently. \"I've met him on a number of occasions, I've seen him as mayor, I've seen him say one thing and contradict one thing, but what now? Will we continue to weekly speak to his teams? Yes. Will I want to meet with him as soon as possible? Yes. Is child health a central pillar of Britain now and in the future? Yes.\n\n\"The biggest morally wrong thing we have to deal with right now is that too many times, the better or healthier option is too expensive. We definitely need governments around the world to subsidy better food.\n\n\"Generally, what a child and what a family needs is the same as what the planet needs - more veg, more nuts, more seeds, more legumes. If I had a magic wand, I'd love to go to David Attenborough and say, 'Can we do a show called My Health, My Planet?' Because I think that's the conversation now.\"\n\nUp your veggie curry game with this delicious recipe.\n\nThere's nothing more satisfying than a curry - and having one up your sleeve that doesn't involve meat is a game-changer for midweek cooking.\n\nJamie Oliver says he wrote the recipe for his stuffed curried aubergines with spicy tamarind and peanut sauce eight years ago, and he's sharing it now in his new veggie cookbook.\n\n1tsp each of cumin seeds, mustard seeds, ground turmeric, garam masala, fenugreek seeds\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 190oC/375oF/gas 5. Peel the onion, garlic and ginger, place in a food processor with the coriander stalks and chillies (deseed if you like), and whiz to a fine paste.\n\n2. Put the spices and curry leaves into a 25cm x 35cm roasting tray on a low heat with two tablespoons of oil and fry for one minute, or until smelling fantastic, stirring constantly. Tip in the paste and cook for five minutes, or until softened, stirring regularly.\n\n3. Stir in the peanut butter, mango chutney and tamarind paste, season with a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper, then scrape into a bowl, adding a splash of water to loosen to a paste, if needed.\n\n4. Leaving them intact at the stalk, cut the aubergines into quarters lengthways, rub and stuff them generously with all the paste, then arrange them in the tray (if using regular aubergines, simply trim then cut into 1cm-thick rounds and sandwich the paste between them).\n\n5. Place the tray on a medium heat and fry for five minutes, turning halfway. Add the coconut milk, roughly chop and sprinkle over the tomatoes, season well with salt and pepper, and bring to the boil.\n\n5. Cover with tin foil and roast for 40 minutes, or until thickened and reduced, removing the foil halfway. Season to perfection and scatter over the coriander leaves.\n\nTo serve: Always good with fluffy rice, poppadoms, yoghurt and extra fresh chilli.\n\nYou might never need chicken or prawn in a pad thai again, after trying Jamie Oliver's new veggie version. You can knock this together in 30 minutes, too. And to make it vegan, just remove the eggs and serve with extra tofu.\n\n2 limes (juiced - plus extra wedges for serving, if you like)\n\n1 shallot\n\n320g crunchy veg, such as asparagus, purple sprouting broccoli, pak choi, baby corn\n\n1. Cook the noodles according to the packet instructions, then drain and refresh under cold running water and toss with one teaspoon of sesame oil.\n\n2. Lightly toast the peanuts in a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat until golden, then bash in a pestle and mortar until fine, and tip into a bowl.\n\n3. Peel the garlic and bash to a paste with the tofu, add one teaspoon of sesame oil, one tablespoon of soy, the tamarind paste and chilli sauce, then squeeze and muddle in half the lime juice.\n\n4. Peel and finely slice the shallot, then place in the frying pan over a high heat. Trim, prep and slice the crunchy veg, as necessary, then dry-fry for four minutes, or until lightly charred (to bring out a nutty, slightly smoky flavour).\n\n5. Add the noodles, sauce, beansprouts, and a good splash of water, toss together over the heat for one minute, then divide between serving bowls.\n\n6. Wipe out the pan, crack in the eggs and cook to your liking in a little olive oil, sprinkling with a pinch of chilli flakes.\n\n7. Trim the lettuce, click apart the leaves and place a few in each bowl. Pop the eggs on top, pick over the herbs, and sprinkle with the nuts. Serve with lime wedges for squeezing over, and extra soy, to taste.\n\nHOW TO MAKE SUPER SPINACH PANCAKES\n\nThese green pancakes are topped with avocado, tomato and cottage cheese.\n\nPancakes and weekends go together perfectly, but what if there was a way to make them healthier? Jamie Oliver packs these ones with spinach to give them a vibrant green colour - and a bit more nutritional value.\n\nServe them with a fried egg on top for an extra-special bonus.\n\n1 lime (juiced - plus more wedges for serving, if you like)\n\n1. Halve, de-stone, peel and finely slice the avocado and quarter the tomatoes, then place in a salad bowl with a quarter of the spinach. Trim, finely slice and add the spring onions and pick in the coriander leaves, then squeeze over the lime juice. Drizzle with one tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil, season to perfection with sea salt and black pepper, toss to coat and put aside.\n\n2. Crack the egg into a blender, add the flour, milk, remaining spinach and a pinch of salt and pepper, then blitz until smooth. Place a large non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, rub the pan with a little olive oil, then pour in a thin layer of batter, swirling it up and around the edges. Cook on one side only for two minutes, or until lightly golden, then stack up on a serving plate and repeat.\n\n3. Top each pancake with dollops of cottage cheese, the avocado salad, and a few good shakes of chilli sauce. Really nice served with extra lime wedges for squeezing over, and a fried egg on top, if you fancy.\n\nMeat-Free Meals airs on Channel 4 this September.

The IPL has diminished the value of the Ranji Trophy because the shelf space of domestic cricket has one more stock-keeping unit (SKU), which has broadcasting, glamour, money, and eyeballs for recognition. If you know what makes IPL popular, address the shortcomings in the ingredients of the Ranji Trophy. The IPL extravaganza has become hotter. The Slam-Bang League is back, and it saw many episodes, and the controversy continues to haunt the game. Whenever there is a bloated money chest, a scam is inevitable.\n\nFarmers and the government are locked in a crucial dialogue over the Minimum Support Price (MSP) formula and procurement. While the government offers flexibility with new crops and family labour inclusion, farmers demand broader coverage and the Swaminathan Commission's C2+50% formula. At the heart lies the assurance of remunerative prices, as market fluctuations threaten farmers' livelihoods. Both sides must remain engaged, for solutions lie in dialogue, not confrontation. Let's bridge the divide and build a sustainable future for our farmers.\n\nThe US veto of an Arab-backed ceasefire resolution for the Israel-Hamas conflict ignited controversy. While the US prioritizes ongoing hostage negotiations, critics see it as tacitly endorsing the war. A counter-resolution proposes a temporary ceasefire linked to releases, but skepticism abounds. The clash highlights tensions between diplomacy and humanitarian needs and the US-Israel discord over the two-state solution. Can a balance be struck, or will further suffering be the grim answer?\n\nWith the passing away of Fali Sam Nariman, India has lost yet another legal luminary par excellence who was not only speaking but also breathing constitutional democracy. He was one who had an unassailable faith in secularism, the lifeline of our country.\n\nIt would not be an exaggeration if I said that most of the verdicts pronounced by the judges of the constitutional bench of the Supreme Court have the influence of the arguments on related matters put forth in the Apex Court by this constitutional expert. At a time when all constitutional bodies appear to remain compromised and a Damocles sword is hanging over the head of secularism, I am reminded of what he has recorded in his autobiography, 'Before Memory Fades'. \"I have lived and flourished in a secular India.. In the fullness of time, if God wills, I would also like to die in a secular India.\"\n\nThe banana tree, with its lush green foliage and bountiful fruit, stands tall as a symbol of sustenance, cultural heritage, and environmental resilience across the globe.

        "title": "Ukraine can still triumph | Peter Caddick-Adams | The Critic Magazine",
        "text": "Ukraine can still triumph\n\nIt needs, and deserves, Western patience and solidarity\n\nArtillery Row\n\nBy\n\nPeter Caddick-Adams 24 February, 2024 Share Slice 1\n\nAlexei Navalny. I am still waiting for someone to nudge me awake and tell me it isn't so. That human life is more valuable than to be snuffed out in some remote arctic dungeon at the whim of a paranoid psychopath. Secure in a gulag, Navalny posed no physical threat to Putin, but ruffled his pride. If there were any doubters, from Spain came the news of another death on 19 February. This time it was Maksim Kuzminov, a Russian helicopter pilot who defected to Ukraine with his twin-engined Mi-8 machine on 23 August last year. Ukraine's GUR intelligence agency had persuaded him to cross the frontier during an elaborate six-month operation, even extracting his family from Russia beforehand.\n\nKuzminov's extinction was brutal and public, being murdered in a Spanish car park, close to where he was living in secret exile. The killer left a curious calling card. He executed the Russian not with one, two or three, but twelve 9mm shots. To those who know, this was the work of someone armed with a PMM (Pistolet Makarova Modernizirovannyy - Modernised Makarov pistol), the FSB's favourite weapon, and issued with a 12-round magazine. It was a visceral and very overt confirmation that Putin will order the death of anyone he hates, as easily as you or I order our cappuccinos.\n\nThat is why, in defiance of all logic, the war in Ukraine has reached its two-year point today. President Zelensky and the entire ruling class of Ukraine and its armed forces know that if they lose, a 9mm Pistolet Makarova Modernizirovannyy bullet, or an encounter with Polonium 2-10, or Novichok, or a tumble down some stairs, from a window or seat in an exploding executive jet awaits them also. This is a Russian tradition. In 1940, Leon Trotsky, ironically one of the originators of extra-national political violence, received his novel demise of an ice-axe in the head on the orders of his political rival, Stalin, in far-off Mexico. In the forests around Katyn, near Smolensk, 4,443 corpses representing much of Poland's intelligentsia were discovered in 1943, murdered by the NKVD as a blood tribute to their leader in the Kremlin. Putin clearly feels the weight of history on his shoulders, to live up to the murderous exploits of his forebears in the KGB, MVD, NKVD, OGPU and Cheka.\n\nThe bigger wheels of history also explain the visceral violence witnessed in several Azerbaijani-Armenian clashes in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, and are seeing in Israel-Palestine, as well as Ukraine. For Armenians, there are smouldering memories of their Medz Yeghern (\"Great Evil Crime\"), the genocide inflicted by the Ottoman Empire during 1914-17. Israel rightly remains haunted by the Shoah (\"Calamity\" in Hebrew), a term for the 1933-45 Holocaust, but also beginning to be applied to 7 October 2023. Palestinians remember the Nabka (\"Catastrophe\"), the destruction of their society, culture, identity, political rights, and national aspirations in 1948, which they see as being re-enacted in their displacement from areas of Gaza. Ukrainians recall the Holodomor (\"Killing by Hunger\"), the Soviet-induced famine that felled up to 5 million during 1932-33.\n\nHistory also reaches down to today's leaders in these struggles. Colonel Semyon Zelensky, Jewish grandfather of Ukraine's president, served in the Red Army's 57th Guards Motor Rifle Division during World War II, while his great-grandfather and three great uncles died in the Holocaust. Viktor Putin, elder brother of Vladimir, died of diphtheria and starvation in 1942 during the Siege of Leningrad. His father, also Vladimir, served in Soviet submarines, later an NKVD battalion and finally the Red Army, being severely wounded in 1942. His maternal grandmother was killed by Germans 1941, and several maternal uncles were posted missing on the Eastern Front. Benjamin Netanyahu's paratrooper brother, Yonatan, died leading the Entebbe airport raid in Uganda in 1976. From our armchairs and in ignorance of these national and personal tragedies, it is easy to sign a petition, or wave our hands and demand a ceasefire. Out of the straitjacket of the Cold War, we now find ourselves in an era of the settling of ancient blood feuds. I fear a cessation any time soon simply ain't going to happen.\n\nHistory can also blind you. In July 2021, President Putin offered us a glimpse of his visual impairment with his essay claiming \"there was no historical basis for the Ukrainian people to be separate from Russia\", denying every aspect of its centuries-old existence as a separate state. Putin went on to demand that NATO end all activity in Eastern Europe and refuse admission to Ukraine. Pre-planned military manoeuvres in Donetsk, Luhansk and neighbouring Belarus followed, which his generals assured the west were not a prelude to invasion.\n\nThen, two years ago today, Russian forces poured over Ukraine's borders in four great thrusts from the north, east, southeast and south as Putin announced a \"special military operation to demilitarise and denazify the pro-NATO neo-Nazi government in Kyiv\", which he claimed were bullying the Donbass and Crimean breakaway republics. Zelensky's Jewish ancestry was ignored for the greater needs of Russia's history. The biggest attack on a European country since 1945 began with dawn land and air attacks. The attackers marked their vehicles with a white letter \"Z\", which soon became a nationalist \"brand\", a sort of latter-day Afrika Korps palm tree insignia made famous by Rommel, and seen on a variety of merchandise throughout Russia, from coffee mugs and posters to badges, uniforms and tee shirts.\n\nCruise missiles struck every Ukrainian city, some reaching as far west as Lviv. Two years on, a much older Ukrainian friend of mine has just visited the city from exile in western Europe. He couldn't fly there for obvious reasons, and the Krakow-Lviv-Kyiv-Odessa Express was full of European and NATO VIPs going about their business. So he took a bus, travelling for a gruelling 16 hours. He arrived in his hometown just as an air raid sounded, and his end of our WhatsApp call was conducted in the surreal atmosphere of a candlelit, sandbagged air raid shelter. After the All Clear siren, by video he walked me around a city with all its public monuments sandbagged for protection and windows covered with tape to stop flying glass. The museums and art galleries are empty, their exhibits hidden away from the \"Orcs\", the most polite of many terms for Russians.\n\nUniforms throng the streets, private vehicles are few. At one stage a squad of uniformed men stopped my friend, looking for draft-dodgers. I chatted with them by video while he unpocketed his ID papers to establish his bona fides. Ordinary citizens are suspicious of everyone and everything -- taking photographs is frowned upon, so are Russian accents, even in a population where 17 percent, my friend included, are of Russian extraction. \"Are you a spy?\" he was asked, without a hint of irony. The nightly TV equivalent of Eastenders, which he thinks should be called Eastfronters, is about the loves and life of a sniper at the front, interspersed with government ads to join the army. From others I find the picture in Kharkiv and Kyiv is the same, though with far more bomb damage.\n\nMore friends have joined the UK-based charities Ambulance Aid and United Ukrainian Foundation to buy vehicles and drive them from London to Ukraine. Each ambulance is \"packed to the roof with medications no longer needed by NHS trusts, sanitary products, hand sanitising gel, and cleaning materials\", while cross-Channel ferry fares are waived and fuel costs for the long journey covered by donations from supporters.\n\nSome of this I recall from my last visit in 2021, like the orthodox churches displaying candle-lit portraits of heroes recently felled in battle, and pharmacies selling \"government-approved\" medical kits, but he showed me how open-air markets have switched from selling eggs, jackets and hats to hand grenades, body armour and helmets. Phone bills show a small surtax on all phone conversations to help pay for the war, to which everybody assumes the SBU (Ukraine's domestic intelligence service) are listening in. Tourist signs for coffee shops are replaced by directions to the nearest shelter. Having reached retirement age, he was one of around eight million Ukrainians who fled abroad, while another eight million moved to western towns, creating Europe's largest refugee crisis since 1945. The population slumped to 36 million, with a brain drain of entrepreneurs and techies heading into the European Union. Those civilians not slaughtered in occupied areas were forcibly evacuated to Russia and Belarus, their children kidnapped and, in some cases, adopted by total strangers.\n\nTwo years ago, Russian airborne forces in helicopters appeared from out of the blue to take Hostomel Airport in Kyiv but were unexpectedly defeated in fierce fighting, withdrawing on 6 April. Other Russians attacking from Belarus were repulsed from north west Kyiv at Irpin and Bucha, leaving a trail of massacred civilians in their wake. An eastern thrust advanced towards Kharkiv and Sumy but halted at great cost, while a southern front from Crimea headed towards the regional capital of Kherson, captured on 2 March, but failed to reach beyond to Mykolaiv and Odessa. However, other forces from Crimea linked up with troops from Donetsk to take Melitopol and the Azov Sea ports of Berdiansk and Mariupol, finally subdued on 20 May at great cost to both sides.\n\nWe all saw how President Zelensky refused to leave Kyiv, instead rallying his nation with Churchillian nightly broadcasts, declaring martial law and introducing conscription. Ukraine's early battlefield successes were partly the result of NATO doctrine and training received from American, British and Canadian troops during 2015-22. Britain's Operation Orbital trained 22,000 Ukrainians in-country, and is now replaced by Operation Interflex, which sees Kyiv's troops, generals included, rehearsing in the UK. \"NATO-approved\" has since become slang for anything innovative or superior, from bazookas to beefsteak.\n\nRussian cyber-attacks were defeated because Kyiv's keyboard warriors had gained an edge over their adversaries during the preceding eight years. This is an important point, for the two-year mark of the Ukraine-Russian war is also near to the tenth anniversary of Russian-engineered unrest which saw Moscow's special forces illegally occupy Crimea in March 2014. The following month, Russian-backed separatists proclaimed independence in the oblasts (provinces) of Donetsk and Luhansk, collectively the Donbass region, containing much of Ukraine's mineral wealth. In other words, Ukraine has actually been in a state of war with Russia and already bloodied for a decade, like an ancient Greek city state.\n\nRussia and the world expected victory within a week\n\nSince then, apart from NATO training, there has been an ongoing cyber war, attracting relatively little attention, which is the way its antagonists prefer. Once across the border in February 2022, Rasputitsa (\"the season of bad roads\"), muddy conditions that make travel on unpaved roads problematic, slowed and stopped Moscow's armoured columns, which were then ambushed by their nimbler opponents. With shades of the halting of both Napoleon and Hitler, I have never understood why Putin did not wait another couple of months for better weather. Russian tanks and trucks were found to be undermanned and deficient of much equipment while their supporting troops proved to be poorly trained conscripts, including convicts, underfed and short in nearly every aspect of logistics, from medical supplies to clothing, ammunition and fuel. Russia and the world expected victory within a week and some of the attackers optimistically packed their best uniforms for a triumphal parade in Kyiv.\n\nThough qualitatively inferior and slow to learn, Russia still possessed its traditional weapons of quantity, and the Red God of War -- artillery, which drenched every Ukrainian counterattack with high explosives. Moscow's campaign leadership was woeful, with the 4 thrusts operating independently, and without coordination. Subsequent unified command hasn't helped, with generals afraid to use their initiative, instead following the Kremlin's rigid orders. Attrition of Russian commanders, on and off the battlefield, has been high, but Putin never visits the front. Moscow reorientated to a war economy with drones supplied from Iran and ammunition from North Korea, both relatively small economies, but with disproportionately powerful military production.\n\nAlthough the West's economy is 20-25 times greater than Russia's, the Kremlin now spends roughly 40 percent of government income on attacking Ukraine, estimated at 6-10 percent of the country's GDP. This commitment helps Putin compensate for the West's much larger economic potential. Between August 2022-May 2023, an attritional slog developed for the city of Bakhmut, in the eastern Donbass, the bloodiest battle seen so far in the 21st century. The nine-month struggle, of Stalingrad proportions, cost the Russians, including many Wagner convicts, 40,000 dead and 80,000 wounded. The defenders lost a quarter of these totals, but casualties of experienced soldiers they can ill afford.\n\nHalted but not ejected from Ukrainian territory, gradually the fighting settled down in a concave arc of trenches and fixed defences, including 750,000 landmines, which in two years of combat Russia was unable to penetrate, but neither was Ukraine. In the centre lies Avdiivka. Defended at great cost, but when faced with total encirclement, Ukrainian forces withdrew on 17 February. Mr Putin is crowing at this pyrrhic \"success\", but any cost-benefit analysis reveals the Russians have merely occupied a total ruin, bought at a material expense they cannot long sustain. The defenders observe that Russian artillery was outfiring them at twenty times the rate of their own guns. However, the city's loss provides an important morale boost for Moscow and dents that of Ukraine.\n\nWith justification, some of Kyiv's troops complain that NATO prepared them for the wrong sort of war, but no one could have foreseen the mass attacks, where Russian conscripts were thrown against fixed positions merely to exhaust the defenders' supplies of ammunition. NATO's way of war calls for massive preparatory airstrikes, artillery barrages and demining before the infantry advances, but without the modern jets, long-range missiles, demining equipment, tanks and armoured personnel carriers they requested, Ukraine's army had to resort to tactics not found in any NATO handbooks.\n\nThat is why, during the summer counteroffensive, Ukraine suffered high casualties and losses of Western-supplied armour, as they bogged down in the thickest minefields ever seen, and were forced to come up with their own battlefield solutions. \"As we're defending our Motherland, we're prepared to take losses, but are jealous of NATO soldiers who know they'll always be supported and can advance knowing they're unlikely to be killed or maimed,\" said one defender. More than 55 percent of Ukraine's land is arable, and provided employment for 14 percent of the population. The World Bank estimates that demining these will cost upwards of $37 billion, with a minimum nationwide reconstruction bill of half a trillion dollars.\n\nAt sea, numerous Russian warships including the flagship Moskva proved themselves vulnerable to cruise missiles and unmanned suicide boats, often identified with the help of western intelligence. It was maritime drones that broke the Russian naval blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea ports and forced the bulk of Putin's fleet to retreat from Crimea. Surprisingly, Russian jets failed to dominate in the air through their lack of experience in supporting ground troops, and exposure to sophisticated Ukrainian air defences. Both sides used vast quantities of drones and already the war suggests that unmanned flying machines will soon outnumber manned aircraft in all the world's air forces. Early this February, President Zelensky announced the creation of a separate branch of his armed forces devoted solely to drones. He has set a target of more than one million domestically-produced in 2024, while a coalition of ten European allies has promised to deliver another million within a year, to offset ammunition shortages and the funding fight in Washington DC.\n\nI remain upbeat about Ukraine: Kyiv will prevail if the west supplies enough aircraft, tanks, long-range artillery and rockets\n\nUnmanned reconnaissance and strike drones were already used extensively in eastern Ukraine from 2014, but the unprecedented numbers deployed by both sides since 2022 lead experts to label this the First Drone War. They revolutionised surveillance, making it difficult for commanders to employ surprise, which explains why both armies find it difficult to punch through each other's defences. Drones also evolved as precision strike weapons, with loitering munitions (designed to crash into their targets) replicating many of the functions of artillery and smart missiles at a fraction of the price. During a single week earlier this year, Ukraine's Minister of Digital Transformation, Mykhailo Fedorov, reported his drone units had destroyed 73 Russian tanks. Every combat unit has a drone detachment, often crowd-funded by grassroots clubs, while a vibrant assembly industry has emerged from nowhere.\n\nI remain upbeat about Ukraine: Kyiv will prevail if the west supplies enough aircraft, tanks, long-range artillery and rockets to destroy Russian logistics. However, if we fail in our duty, Russia with its population of 145 million and larger economy will triumph if it can concentrate enough armour, artillery and well-trained manpower to advance. Yet it would be a mistake to think that Ukraine can continue holding the front for as long as the West needs in order to decide its approach. All my Ukrainian friends accuse us of dithering and delay in supplying the kit they need, especially when their requests were made immediately after the invasion.\n\nThe rebellion of Prigozhin's Wagner Group, coupled with the excesses of the US Blackwater Group (subsequently renamed Academi, and now Constellis) in Iraq have led some to surmise the era of the private contractor in mainstream battle is over. With its mass use of tanks, artillery and troops, two years on modern generals across the globe are pondering whether the Ukraine War is a throwback anomaly, or with the addition of mobile phone networks, social media and vast numbers of unmanned aircraft, it is the portent of all wars to come.\n\nRussia has lost staggering quantities of battlefield equipment, including a minimum of 3,500 tanks (probably far more) fed pointlessly into combat. Statistically that is five percent of all the 70,000 tanks in the world. There are few reliable human casualty figures, but best guesses suggest 100,000 Ukrainian troops killed, 150,000 wounded, plus 50,000 civilian casualties. Across the divide, by most estimates the war so far has cost Mr Putin over 200,000 killed with another 200,000 wounded. However, the man in the Kremlin is in denial, having reached his Act 3 of Macbeth moment: \"I am in blood: Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as to go o'er.\" In other words, having reached this stage in all his slaughter and tyranny, it will make little difference if he retreats or just keeps pushing on. Thus, Putin and his regime are in this for the long term.\n\nIn terms of available reserves, Zelensky finds himself in a pickle. Despite 40,000 Ukrainians still dodging the draft, Kyiv has around 1.1 million personnel under arms, the majority conscripts and volunteers aged 25-60. Obliged to serve until the war's end, they are allowed ten days' leave a year and well-paid, courtesy of western economic aid. Yet, this is not enough. In December, politicians and army chiefs debated calling up another 500,000. Influential voices pushed back, faced with a birth-rate slump since 2014 and unwilling to gamble the nation's youth of 18-24-year-olds. With the defence of Avdiivka alone having cost 17,000 killed and 30,000 wounded, wise counsel suggests that additional numbers are pointless unless they receive the latest western weaponry and ammunition.\n\nHence the enormous pressure Zelensky is applying on his international allies for guns and money. This was also one of the differences of opinion between Zelensky and his former army chief, Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, which got him fired. The general advocated the \"metal, not flesh\" approach adopted by Field Marshal Montgomery during World War II - superior weapons and training, but not necessarily more personnel. By contrast, Putin (also faced with a shrinking birth-rate) has just summoned another 300,000 conscripts into uniform with a flick of his pen.\n\nThe dreadful losses take us back to the Western Front of 1915-17 or the Eastern Front struggles of 1941-4 and it is worth pausing to consider the international picture at the two-year mark of both global conflagrations. Two years after the Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia, 28 July 1916, none of the main protagonists could sense victory at Verdun or on the Somme. Likewise, on 1 September 1941, two years after the invasion of Poland, the war looked grim for Britain and Russia, and was about to verge on the catastrophic for the United States. Big wars (and this is one such) have a dynamic of their own, which cannot be hurried, and although more dark days certainly lie ahead for Ukraine, remember that the underdogs prevailed in the end. Ukraine seems like a judo expert being attacked by a boxer: history suggests that agility, doctrine and training tends to win wars, not raw brawn and bulk.\n\nMoscow has faced and ignored international condemnation for its aggression and human rights abuses, while trade and financial sanctions have had only a limited effect, partly because Russia is selling huge quantities of cheap oil to India and China in exchange for hard currency. There is also great reluctance to impound and donate to Kyiv the Russian sovereign wealth funds held in western banks, for fear of setting a dangerous international precedent. Both sides have relied on television and social media to bolster their own populations and demoralise opponents. In this light, do not worry about the widely-reported comments of ex-president and former prime minister Dimitri Medvedev of 20 February.\n\nIn a bizarre 'thought experiment', he discussed the possibility of Ukraine's success, an interesting development in itself. In Medvedev's opinion, the return of Ukraine to its pre-2014 borders would \"contradict the Russian constitution\". He then expounded, \"And now to the main question: Do these idiots [in the West] really believe that Russia's people would accept such a disintegration of their country? On the contrary, our armed forces would deploy their entire nuclear arsenal and attack Washington, Berlin and London in addition to Kyiv.\"\n\nTake heart, gentle reader, at the unlikelihood of this eventuality, for three reasons. Most of the Russian leaders' families lurk secretly in the west; much of their money sits in western banks. Finally, if the United Kingdom cannot get its Trident missiles to function correctly, and Moscow's new \"Sarmat\" long-range nuclear weapons have been rushed into service on the back of a single successful test, there is no chance that any of Mr Medvedev's intercontinental ballistic rockets will reach their targets.\n\nShare Slice 1 Enjoying The Critic online?

        "title": "Our Fighting Democracy: A Letter from Ukraine",
        "text": "Two years ago, Russia launched its full-scale war against Ukraine. Our country is fighting for its democracy. The conditions for this could hardly be more extreme. Since 1945, no democracy on the European continent has faced challenges similar to those of Ukraine.\n\nUnder these extreme wartime conditions, the Ukrainian people have demonstrated their resilience and commitment to fight for freedom and independence. Simultaneously, the public governance system has proven its ability to sustain democracy and adhere to democratic principles of state administration in practice.\n\nDespite the enemy's efforts, Ukrainian democracy continues to uphold constitutional provisions, even amidst military operations. The Constitution enshrines the European identity of the Ukrainian people and the irrevocability of Ukraine's European and Euro-Atlantic trajectory.\n\nThis vector is evidenced by Ukraine's status as a candidate country for the European Union (EU) in the summer of 2022 and its subsequent fulfillment of relevant EU requirements. As of February 2024, the Government of Ukraine has already approved the Action Plan for the implementation of the European Commission's recommendations. This progress was made possible thanks to the Ukrainian people's armed defense of their democracy.\n\nWe, two constitutional law experts from Ukraine, would like to use the second anniversary of Russia's full-scale assault to report in our \"Letter from Ukraine\" on how Ukrainian democracy manages to persist in these challenging times.\n\nDespite the inherent military risks, the Ukrainian Parliament continues to operate under martial law, carrying out almost all of its constitutional functions. The Parliament's legislative function has led to the adoption of numerous significant laws. In addition to enacting laws in the military, humanitarian, and social sectors, the Parliament has also passed laws related to European integration.\n\nThe President of Ukraine also continued to exercise his powers in accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine. Under parts two and three of Article 102 of the Constitution, the President serves as the guarantor of state sovereignty, territorial integrity of Ukraine, adherence to the Constitution, and the rights and freedoms of its citizens. He also ensures the implementation of the strategic course of the state towards full membership in the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n\nIn practice, the President of Ukraine, in his role as Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (Article 106, paragraph 17, part one of the Constitution), prioritizes the defense of Ukraine and the protection of state sovereignty as his primary responsibilities during the full-scale invasion by Russia.\n\nW3-Professur \"\u00d6ffentliches Recht mit Schwerpunkt Bau-, Planungs- und Umweltrecht\" an der RPTU / Standort Kaiserslautern\n\nF\u00fcr die Nachfolge der W3-Professur \"\u00d6ffentliches Recht mit Schwerpunkt Bau-, Planungs- und Umweltrecht\", sucht der Fachbereich Raum- und Umweltplanung der RPTU interessierte Kandidat*innen f\u00fcr Lehre und Forschung.\n\nBut what is the response to the speculations of some that the Ukrainian government lacks legitimacy because no elections were held? Our answer is straightforward: Since the end of World War II, no democracy in Europe has faced a challenge comparable to what Ukraine is currently experiencing.There is almost no practical experience in constitutional and legal regulation of public authorities' activities under these extraordinary conditions.\n\nAs per Ukrainian legislation, parliamentary elections in Ukraine were scheduled for October 29, 2023. However, Article 19 of the Law of Ukraine \"On the legal regime of martial law\" stipulates that parliamentary, presidential, and local elections are all prohibited under martial law. Furthermore, part four of Article 83 of the Constitution of Ukraine clearly states that if the term of authority of the Verkhovna Rada expires during the state of martial law, its powers are extended until the day when the newly elected Verkhovna Rada convenes for its first meeting of the first session, following the cancellation of the state of martial law. Most foreign constitutions contain similar provisions.\n\nRegarding the presidential elections in Ukraine, the Constitution of Ukraine stipulates that regular presidential elections are held on the last Sunday of March in the fifth year of the President's term. Therefore, under peaceful circumstances, the elections should have taken place on March 31, 2024, with the Parliament scheduling them no later than December 21, 2023.\n\nHowever, due to the legal regime of martial law, the next presidential election will not adhere to the constitutional timeline. In such a scenario, Article 108 of the Constitution of Ukraine is invoked to prevent a power vacuum and ensure the continuity of power. This means that the current President of Ukraine retains their authority until a newly-elected President assumes office after the first post-war elections.\n\nConducting elections under martial law is therefore not possible according to either constitutional law or electoral law provisions. But also beyond legal considerations: there is no public demand for wartime elections.These arguments justify the constitutional and legal feasibility and appropriateness of extending the terms of the Parliament and the President under martial law, particularly to safeguard democracy in Ukraine.\n\nThe judiciary in Ukraine continues to function in line with the country's Constitution. There is a noticeable enhancement of judicial institutions and the implementation of the European Commission's recommendations.\n\nIn 2023, a competitive selection process was introduced for the Constitutional Court of Ukraine (CCU), confirming the sustainability of Ukrainian democracy. For the first time in Ukraine's history, the appointment of judges to the CCU will involve international experts. The selection process will assess candidates based on their level of competence in law and their high moral standards. Furthermore, in 2023, both the High Council of Justice and the High Qualification Commission of Judges of Ukraine recommenced their operations.\n\nUkraine's local self-government has also continued to function under conditions of extreme pressure. Before Russia's full-scale invasion, Ukraine's decentralization reform of 2014 has shown some positive results. (However, progress has stalled since 2019).\n\nThe imposition of martial law necessitated the establishment of military administrations, which assumed the responsibilities of local self-governance in certain areas. At the same time, even under martial law, the local government system, a cornerstone of the constitutional order, has persevered, continues to operate, and maintains interaction with government bodies. Notably, at the onset of the war, municipal authorities shouldered the responsibility of ensuring territorial defense and accommodating internally displaced persons.\n\nA good example is the work of the municipal authorities in Kharkiv, a city of over a million residents near the frontline. Despite the proximity to the Russian border and constant shelling, local self-government in the city and the region remains functional and responsive to the needs of the local population. The local authorities' initiative to construct and organize underground preschools and schools, which continue to operate in an in-person classroom format even amidst almost daily shelling, is noteworthy.\n\nRegrettably, there have been instances where the state has imposed certain restrictions on local self-governance, primarily involving the curtailment of local governments' budgetary powers and constraints on local budget revenues.\n\nRussia's military aggression against Ukraine has revealed a very interesting fact. The Ukrainian people have demonstrated their legal consciousness. Recognizing the risks of losing their statehood, the nation has entered into a new, unwritten social contract with the authorities. The content of this agreement is unity and a joint fight against the enemy. The preservation and protection of the fundamental principles of the constitutional order, even in the face of military aggression, attest to this. The struggle, however, continues.\n\nThe survival of Ukrainian statehood and the operation of public authorities post-February 24, 2022, are undoubtedly a testament to the heroism of the Ukrainian military, volunteers, and the nation as a whole.\n\nWe hope that this letter gives an impression that our democracy is resilient - and that it is fighting.\n\nHowever, we would like to conclude this letter by expressing our gratitude. We thank all military servicemen and we thank our colleagues and legal scholars Volodymyr Nesterovych and Roman Kuybida, who have been defending their homeland from the Russian Federation for over two years.\n\nKyiv/Kharkiv, February 24, 2024\n\nIn the United States, Trump is facing multiple legal proceedings, both civil and criminal, ranging from the trivial to the egregious. But particular attention has been paid to the invocation of section 3 of the 14th Amendment by the Colorado Supreme Court to strike Trump from the ballot for inciting the insurrection on January 6th. SAMUEL ISSACHAROFF is skeptical of utilizing section 3 specifically and legal proceedings generally to disqualify insincere democrats.\n\nMARK GRABER replied to this the very next day. The relevant constitutional amendment is not that complicated, he explained. Ultimately, there is a (somewhat historical) consensus among historians that Section 3 should exclude precisely those people from high office who, like Trump, have sinned against the constitution and its institutions.\n\nHow can regulatory law at universities enable the protection of spaces for discourse without criminalising unnecessarily? After recent conflicts at universities in Berlin, NIKOLAS EISENTRAUT asks the Berlin state legislature to make adjustments with a sense of proportion instead of simply swinging the \"exmatriculation club\".\n\nLARS DITTRICH considers the idea of a reservation of consent by the Federal Constitutional Court for amendments to the BVerfGG and warns that better institutional protection of the Federal Constitutional Court could release democrats from their duty to stand up and protect the institutions themselves.\n\nThe influence of the German Federal Constitutional Court's climate ruling beyond its specific regulatory content can be seen in the current double judgment on emergency climate programmes by the Berlin-Brandenburg Higher Administrative Court. NIKLAS T\u00c4UBER puts emphasis on the high level of argumentation in the decision, but also criticizes unused potential.\n\nIn a case breaking new ground for women's rights, the CJEU held that women, especially those facing domestic violence in their country of origin, qualify as a protected 'social group,' allowing them to access refugee status or subsidiary protection in the Common European Asylum System. SILVIA STEININGER welcomes the decision as a step forward in remedying the gendered nature of the EU's asylum system while reminding us that gender based violence remains a pervasive problem within the EU too.\n\nThe European Commission paid Hungary a country visit this week and should use the occasion to take a closer look at an often ignored aspect of Hungary's rule of law-backsliding. VICTOR Z. KAZAI explains that contrary to wide-spread belief, the Orb\u00e1n-government did not pass its illiberal legislative reforms in a legally correct manner. Instead, the governmental majority has consistently violated the formal and procedural rules of parliamentary law-making.\n\nIn einer Kooperationsveranstaltung mit der GEW Th\u00fcringen gehen wir Szenarien und Strategien f\u00fcr den autorit\u00e4r-populistischen Ernstfall in Schulen auf den Grund. In dem Workshop werden die Ergebnisse der Recherche des Th\u00fcringen-Projekts pr\u00e4sentiert und gemeinsam mit der Seminargruppe M\u00f6glichkeiten erarbeitet, Schulen und Lehrkr\u00e4fte f\u00fcr politische Vereinnahmungsstrategien zu sensibilisieren und Resilienz aufzubauen. Hier geht es zur Anmeldung f\u00fcr die Termine im Mai und Juni 2024.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nIn Pakistan, the delayed, disrupted and highly disputed elections have been finally held on February 8, 2024. However, electoral democracy in Pakistan will now be haunted by the irrational decisions of the current Supreme Court of Pakistan, which suppressed the campaign of Imran Khan's Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI) and denied the PTI its' electoral symbol: the cricket bat. MOEEN CHEEMA explains the role of the Qazi Court in the worst elections in Pakistan's recent history.\n\nThe presidential elections in Senegal have been postponed at short notice, which has caused some concern. In his article, DIMITRIOS PARASHU explains the role of the Senegalese Constitutional Council in this context and how this constitutional body opposes political \"mischief\".\n\nIn India, the Supreme Court has ruled that anonymous donations to parties under the so-called \"Electoral Bond Scheme\" are unconstitutional. ANMOL JAIN explains why this is an important ruling for democracy - and why it strengthens both transparency and accountability.\n\nGiven the announcement by Donald Trump to withhold US military support in case of an attack on a NATO member by Russia, a discussion has been sparked on whether Europe itself should have their own nuclear weapons for nuclear deterrence. PHILIPP SAUTER explains why European nuclear weapons would violate international law. Hence, only one option remains for European nuclear deterrence without the US involved: France could unilaterally declare that it is willing to use its nuclear weapons once a Member State invokes a mutual defense clause.\n\nIn Spain, the Council of the Judiciary cannot be renewed due to the inability of the major political opponents to find a political solution. To overcome the stalemate, the parties asked the European Commission to intervene and help to untangle this political knot. MIKEL D\u00cdEZ SARASOLA explains the situation and warns that the Commission's role in domestic constitutional matters can have important yet uncertain and questionable consequences.\n\nThe provisional measures ordered by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Israel have been a frequent topic of discussion on our blog. As a reminder: On January 26, 2024, the court found that there was a risk of irreparable harm to the rights of the Palestinians under the Genocide Convention. But what are the implications of this decision for third countries, especially in terms of arms exports? NORA SALEM has answers.\n\nIn recent months, Israel captured hundreds of alleged Hamas fighters, many directly responsible for the October 7 attacks. How can and should Israel try them? NOAM KOZLOV gave an overview, arguing for civil, not military trials.\n\nFinally: We also had a comparative symposium on new developments and old tricks in the new European platform regulation, the Digital Services Act. Particularly noteworthy was that the contributions curated by Jo\u00e3o Pedro Quintais often combined US and European voices, which uncovered how some of the supposed innovations from Brussels build on pre-existing ideas from the US. Rebecca Tushnet, for example, criticized the constant (self-)regulatory strive for consistency, while Rachel Griffin and Erik Stallman questioned the 'human-in-the-loop' fetish of contemporary AI regulation. Eric Goldman and Sebastian Schwemer detailed how the US DMCA anticipated some of the innovations of the DSA. Martin Senftleben and Eleonora Rosati questioned the role of users in the DSA and Giancarlo Frosio and Christophe Geiger spelled out principles of digital constitutionalization. Martin Husovec and Jennifer Urban, in turn, examined the extent to which the DSA will have a 'Brussels Effect'. Niva Elkin-Koren focused on the fundamentally new data access for scientists that is actually regulated by the DSA.",

        "title": "Explained: How India has become 4th largest defence spender in the world",
        "text": "The Indian Army's Pinaka multi-barrel rocket launcher. In 2022, India was the fourth largest military spender in the world. File image/Reuters\n\nThe world is seeing two wars -- the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas conflict. There's also the concern that China will launch an offensive against Taiwan. It is amid this volatility and conflict that India has slowly but steadily been increasing its defence spending, making it one of the world's top five military spenders today.\n\nThere is a marked difference from India's earlier years, which hardly saw any development in the defence. One can say that the sector has seen significant growth in the latter part of the 20th Century, and rapid progress in the last 15-odd years.\n\nIn this explainer, we take you through India's growing defence spending -- budgetary allocations and more -- and how India compares to the world.\n\nWhat's India's defence spending?\n\nIn 2022, Swedish think tank Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in its annual report stated that India was the fourth biggest military spender -- only behind the United States ($877 billion), China ($292 billion) and Russia ($86.4 billion).\n\nAs per data, India's military expenditure was a whopping $81.4 billion (Rs 6.7 lakh crore), up from $76.6 billion in the previous year -- a six per cent rise. A comparison to the 2013 figures and it reveals that it's a 47 per cent rise.\n\nThe report added that around 23 per cent of the total spending by India was towards funding equipment and infrastructure. However, a major part of the spending was on expenditures like salaries and pensions.\n\nEven a look at India's defence budgets over the years show a rise in allocation of funds. In this year's interim Budget, the defence allocation was the highest -- Rs 6.2 lakh crore. Of that, a total of Rs 1.72 lakh crore was set aside for the military for capital expenditure that largely includes purchasing new weapons, aircraft, warships and other military hardware.\n\nAnd this allocation of funds has been significantly growing over the years. In 2023, the Government had allocated Rs 5.93 lakh crore, which accounted for over 13 per cent of the total expenditure of the Centre -- the largest across all ministries.\n\nIn 2022, the defence budget was Rs 5.25 lakh crore. This was an increase from the Rs 4.78 lakh crore in 2021. And in 2020, India's defence sector was allocated Rs 4.71 lakh (Rs 4,71,378 crore), which constituted 15.5 per cent of the Centre's Budget and 2.1 per cent of India's estimated GDP.\n\nWhere is India's defence budget spent?\n\nWhile India's allocation for the defence sector has been rising, it's also important to see where this money goes.\n\nA big chunk of the allocated funds go towards defence pensions and salaries; in 2024-2025, the amount earmarked for this was Rs 1.41 lakh crore. In fact, an Indian Express report stated that the military's modernisation budget for 2024-25 saw a meagre hike of only 6.17 per cent.\n\nAnother significant component of India's defence spending is imports. In 2023, data showed that India procured military hardware worth Rs 1.93 lakh crore from abroad in the past five years which included helicopters, aircraft radars, rockets, guns, assault rifles, missiles and ammunition. Notably, SIPRI had declared India to be the world's top importer of military hardware in 2018 to 2022. \"With an 11 per cent share of total global arms imports, India was the world's biggest importer of major arms in 2018-22, a position it has held for the period 1993-2022,\" it said.\n\nHowever, the report added that India's defence imports were falling -- from 62 per cent to 45 per cent between 2017 and 2022. In fact, India's been more focused in the past two-three years\n\nWhy is India's defence spending rising?\n\nBut what has prompted this rise in India's military spending? As former Chief of the Army General MM Naravane (retired) wrote in The Print, \"A country decides how much is enough depending on the threats it faces, both external and internal. Defence expenditure can be likened to an insurance premium. The greater the risks to be covered, the greater the premium. Similarly, the greater the number of threats a nation faces, the more it will have to allocate in terms of the defence budget.\"\n\nAnd India faces a double threat -- China and Pakistan. Islamabad remains a constant threat to New Delhi; it continues to fuel unrest in Kashmir through terrorism.\n\nAnd China is also fermenting trouble for India. Since 2020 following the Galwan clash in which 20 Indian soldiers died, Indo-Sino tensions have been on the rise. Moreover, China has been expanding in the north; in Tibet, it has -- as per an IDR report -- constructed 14 air bases and an oil pipeline from Gormo to Lhasa. The construction of a 1,118 km long rail link from Gormo to Lhasa is also underway. In addition, it is believed to have deployed some two-dozen ballistic missiles including nuclear-capable ICBMs in Tibet.\n\nPlease read more of our defence explainers\n\nBrahMos, ammo & more: A look at weapons India exports\n\nHow India became part of an elite club of nations building aircraft carriers\n\nWhy does India want to contain China in the South China Sea?\n\nIndia's increased defence spending is on trend with other countries. In 2022, data showed that total global military expenditure increased 3.7 per cent in real terms to reach $2.24 trillion.\n\nThe world's 10 largest military spenders are the US, China, Russia, India, Saudi Arabia, UK, Germany, France, South Korea and Japan . Ukraine was placed at 11th rank with $44 billion and Pakistan at 24th spot with $10.3 billion.\n\nInterestingly, US and China combined accounted for 52 per cent of the world's military spending in 2022. SIPRI had then said: \"The continuous rise in global military expenditure in recent years is a sign that we are living in an increasingly insecure world. States are bolstering military strength in response to a deteriorating security environment, which they do not foresee improving in the near future.\"\n\nAccording to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (ISS), in 2023, total global defence expenditure reached $2.2 trillion, with the think tank saying that this was being driven by the ongoing Russian war in Ukraine, and the exacerbating relationship between the US and China.\n\nFor instance, Taiwan has boosted its defence budget by about $3 billion, or 20 per cent. In fact, The Philippines was the only country to reduce its military budget in 2023. However, it has expanded its cooperation with the US military.\n\nAs General Naravane writes, \"Increased allocations for defence should be seen through the prism of peace and development, with expenditure considered as an investment that yields handsome returns. Peace is a prerequisite for development, and it can only prevail if we remain prepared for war.\"",

We, therefore, need to adapt to the use of modern technologies, which are lately becoming more affordable and accessible,\" he said.\n\n\"We cannot afford to forget the fact that you need to invest in maritime capabilities,\" he added.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Adm. John C. Aquilino, Commander, US Indo-Pacific Command, United States said, \"We're unwilling to accept the forceful imposition of rules that counter what we believe in and what we stand for, and that doesn't benefit anybody across the globe. We have to protect our force, to protect the free flow of commerce, and we have to do it together.\"Notably, the Raisina Dialogue is India's flagship conference on geopolitics and geoeconomics, committed to addressing the most challenging issues facing the global community.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis was the chief guest and keynote speaker at the ongoing 9th Raisina Dialogue. He inaugurated the dialogue with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 21. (ANI)",

        "title": "Israel Supporters Are Some Of The Worst People In The World",
        "text": "Listen to a reading of this article (reading by Tim Foley):\n\nYesterday I shared a tweet about how Doctors Without Borders are now encountering children as young as five in Gaza who say they want to die because of the horrific things they have experienced during Israel's ongoing genocidal onslaught.\n\nIt's just about the most awful thing you can imagine, tiny children being so traumatized that they consciously don't want to go on living. It boggles the mind to even contemplate it. But almost as soon as I shared my post, I got a response from an Israel supporter saying, \"Gazans support Hamas. Hamas conducts Islamic extremist terror. Gazans should reconsider their support for Hamas.\"\n\nLater I got another response from an account with a bunch of flag emojis next to its name saying, \"Before shedding tears for the people of Gaza, remember that they created Hamas, elected it, supported it, supplied it, worked for it, hid it, sheltered it, filled its ranks and celebrated all its atrocities.\"\n\nI received another response from an anonymous account saying \"FAFO\", an acronym for \"Fuck Around, Find Out\". Used here, it means that those small children who want to die because of the horrors they have experienced actually deserve it, because they are Gazan. Which is also essentially what the other two responders were saying as well.\n\nThis happens all the time. The other day I shared a report from an American doctor saying that IDF snipers have been picking off Gazan children with single shots to the head, and I again received a comment from someone saying \"Fuck around and find out.\"\n\nThey're essentially standing over a pile of child corpses and puffing their chests like a guy who just won a pub brawl.\n\nIt might seem kind of petty to focus on individual comments from random social media accounts, but this happens so often, and I see other people talking about it too -- I just saw a screenshot of a guy saying \"fuck around and find out\" in response to that gut-wrenching photo of a dead Palestinian girl ripped apart by an Israeli airstrike in Rafah earlier this month. So this is definitely a symptom of something profoundly ugly lurking in the underbelly of our society that's worth drawing some attention to.\n\nIf you don't interact with many Zionists in your day to day life or don't have a large enough profile to be constantly swarmed by Israel apologists you might be unaware that this is happening, but the vitriol I've been seeing from Israel supporters on social media platforms since October 7 has been one of the most shocking and disturbing things I've ever witnessed.\n\nEvery single day these last four and a half months I've been inundated with comments from Israel supporters excusing the most monstrous acts imaginable in the most monstrous ways imaginable. People calling for the total destruction of Gaza. People saying the Gazans deserve what is happening to them. Saying the sickest shit you can possibly think of in response to news of terrible things happening to innocent children.\n\nOver the years I've butted heads with pretty much every political faction in the English-speaking world at one point or another, and I can honestly say that Israel supporters are by far the absolute worst. No political faction I have ever interacted with is as immoral and dishonest, or so frequently says things that are so jaw-droppingly disgusting I am sure I must be misinterpreting it at first. I've never tangled with a more odious group of people.\n\nAnd to be clear I'm not talking about a faction of just Israelis or Jews here; a huge percentage of these awful comments come from Christian Zionists and American rightists, with a decent smattering of Hindu nationalists from India who'll support any excuse to cheerlead the killing of Muslims. The only unifying feature I'm seeing in the faction I'm talking about is that they support Israel and its actions in Gaza. What I'm saying here will be spun as antisemitic by Israel supporters no matter how I put it because Israel supporters are manipulative liars, but to be clear this is not about Jews at all.\n\nThere's something seriously, seriously wrong with these people. They have no interest in truth or morality; all they care about is supporting their favorite ethnostate and murdering Palestinians. I guess when you're already able to numb your heart and your mind enough to support an apartheid state that whose existence requires nonstop violence and abuse, when that state ramps up its atrocities to historic levels you're not going to have enough of a conscience to see anything wrong with it.\n\nAnyway that's my rant for today. Just had to get that out. I don't know what to do about any of this, but it's probably worth bringing some consciousness to.\n\n______________\n\nMy work is entirely reader-supported, so if you enjoyed this piece here are some options where you can toss some money into my tip jar if you want to.

        "title": "Amid global risks, investment themes for Thailand",
        "text": "The global economic and investment landscape at the beginning of 2024 bears some similarities to the start of last year. Stock markets that are performing well -- Japan, the US and Europe, as well as India -- have advanced in the range of 3-15%, while emerging markets such as Thailand, Hong Kong and China have shrunk by 2-5%.\n\nThis is in line with world economic data, in particular the purchasing managers' index (PMI) figures of large economies, which continue to expand.\n\nThe outlook is encouraging even though some important indicators such as GDP, retail sales and industrial production have slowed, amid falling inflation after central banks raised interest rates to the highest levels in decades. Overall, the world economy still faces a variety of risk factors, which can be described in three groups:\n\n1. Monetary policy risk: After two years of tightening monetary policy by central banks to eliminate inflation, concerns have arisen about the financial system, from rising bond yields to commercial real estate to the health of banks.\n\n2. Political and policy risks: Around 4 billion people worldwide will vote this year, with the US election likely commanding the most attention, which will come with unpredictable consequences.\n\n3. Geopolitical risks: From conflicts in Ukraine and Israel to the Red Sea and Taiwan, analysts are using terms such as \"polycrisis\" and \"new world disorder\" to describe rising anxiety levels.\n\nHowever, the global economy has been relatively resilient in the face of these risks. At the start of 2023, most economists thought a global recession would occur, but global GDP is still growing by around 3%.\n\nData from the US investment bank Goldman Sachs indicates global economic activity is as buoyant now as it was in 2019 before the pandemic. Weekly GDP readings produced by the OECD show similar results, while measures of global activity as reflected in PMI point to strong growth worldwide.\n\nImportant risk areas such as geopolitics do not appear to be a big problem. There's not much evidence indicating that attacks on shipping in the Red Sea are hurting the economy that much.\n\nPMI data suggests producers are factoring in longer delivery times as more cargo vessels and tankers take the long route around the Cape of Good Hope. This increases the distance between Shanghai and Rotterdam to 23,000km from 18,000km.\n\nIn any case, shipping costs are only a small part of overall product prices. As a result, inflation is likely to rise only slightly.\n\nOur analysis reveals geopolitical risks are increasing at an above-average rate. The Geopolitical Risk Index is 148.3, well above the average of 111.4 since 2020.\n\nHowever, it is lower than in the early months of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, when it reached 300.\n\nMeanwhile, economic policy risk, measured by the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, is 254.4, down from the three-year average of 263.9. This is likely because interest rates are starting to decrease as inflation falls, causing bond yields to decrease.\n\nIn light of these figures, our analysis found there is not much of a relationship between the economy and geopolitical risks. Meanwhile, reduced policy risks are helping the world economy to expand steadily.\n\nEven amid a polycrisis, we believe as long as geopolitical risks do not lead to a full-blown regional or world war, it is possible the global economy will continue to expand, albeit at a slower pace, but we should see a soft landing.\n\nYet we remain cautious as we have seen how higher interest rates retard growth.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war or a broader Middle East conflict could trigger another round of energy supply disruptions, leading to rising inflation.\n\nIn Thailand, the economy in the fourth quarter of 2023 expanded by 1.7% year-on-year, well below the market consensus of 2.5%, but close to our expectation of 1.8%.\n\nFull-year growth was a disappointing 1.9%. We have four observations about the Thai economy:\n\nGiven the various risks, we adjusted our forecast for the Thai economy downward in 2024, based on two scenarios.\n\nIf the government's digital wallet stimulus is implemented, the economy will expand by 3.7% (down from an earlier forecast of 4.1%).\n\nWithout the digital wallet, we expect growth of 2.8% (down from 3.2% predicted earlier), while the Bank of Thailand may be able to cut interest rates twice this year.\n\nIn terms of investment strategy, we recommend selective buys based on two main themes: stocks expected to benefit from the recovery of the foreign tourist market, namely AOT and MINT; and long-term investments based on dollar-cost averaging, comprising BBL, BDMS, BEM, CPALL, PTT and SCC.",

        "title": "NASA Langley gets assist in latest moon landing",
        "text": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Landing a spacecraft on the moon has long been a series of hits and misses.\n\nNow, a U.S. company has become the first private outfit to achieve a safe moon landing. Only five countries have done it.\n\nA lander built by Intuitive Machines through a NASA-sponsored program touched down on the moon Thursday. It ended up tipped over on its side but was working with limited communications, company officials said Friday.\n\nBut at the last minute, engineers used a tool designed by scientists at NASA Langley to help reach the surface.\n\nHours before the mission was slated to land, engineers with Intuitive Machines discovered a problem with its navigation sensor, so they turned to NASA's guidance system for an assist to precisely land in the challenging terrain of the South Pole of the moon.\n\nNASA's Navigation Doppler Lidar System, or NDL, was designed at NASA Langley. It uses three cameras, which laser beams come out of. That laser hits the moon surface and then is reflected back to estimate height above the surface.\n\nNASA hopes to use this technology in the future to land crewed missions as part of its Artemis program.\n\n\"During the Apollo missions, large radars or astronauts using their eyes, looking out of the viewport, were used to help land the vehicle,\" said Glenn Hines, NDL chief engineer at Langley Research Center. \"NDL is going to help take the burden off of the crew with a much smaller, lower power and more accurate instrument.\"\n\nThe spacecraft is operational and sending back data, so it's hopeful it will be sending back images soon.\n\nThe achievement puts the U.S. back on the moon for the first time since NASA astronauts closed out the Apollo program in 1972.\n\nThe moon is littered with wreckage from failed landings over the years. Another U.S. company -- Astrobotic Technology -- tried to send a lander to the moon last month, but had to give up because of a fuel leak. The crippled lander came crashing back through the atmosphere, burning up over the Pacific.\n\nBoth U.S. businesses are part of NASA's effort to support commercial deliveries to the moon.\n\nThe Soviet Union's Luna 9 successfully touches down on the moon in 1966, after its predecessors crash or miss the moon altogether. The U.S. follows four months later with Surveyor 1. Both countries achieve more robotic landings, as the race heats up to land men.\n\nAPOLLO RULES\n\nNASA clinches the space race with the Soviets in 1969 with a moon landing by Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Twelve astronauts explore the surface over six missions, before the program ends with Apollo 17 in 1972. Still the only country to send humans to the moon, the U.S. hopes to return crews to the surface by the end of 2026 or so, a year after a lunar fly-around by astronauts.\n\nCHINA EMERGES\n\nChina, in 2013, becomes the third country to successfully land on the moon, delivering a rover named Yutu, Chinese for jade rabbit. China follows with the Yutu-2 rover in 2019, this time touching down on the moon's unexplored far side -- an impressive first. A sample return mission on the moon's near side in 2020 yields nearly 4 pounds (1.7 kilograms) of lunar rocks and dirt. Another sample return mission should be launching soon, but this time to the far side. Seen as NASA's biggest moon rival, China aims to put its astronauts on the moon by 2030.\n\nRUSSIA STUMBLES\n\nIn 2023, Russia tries for its first moon landing in nearly a half-century, but the Luna 25 spacecraft smashes into the moon. The country's previous lander -- 1976's Luna 24 -- not only landed, but returned moon rocks to Earth.\n\nINDIA TRIUMPHS ON TAKE 2\n\nAfter its first lander slams into the moon in 2019, India regroups and launches Chandrayaan-3 (Hindi for moon craft) in 2023. The craft successfully touches down, making India the fourth country to score a lunar landing. The win comes just four days after Russia's crash-landing.\n\nJAPAN LANDS SIDEWAYS\n\nJapan becomes the fifth country to land successfully on the moon, with its spacecraft touching down in January. The craft lands on the wrong side, compromising its ability to generate solar power, but manages to crank out pictures and science before falling silent when the long lunar night sets in.\n\nPRIVATE TRIES\n\nA privately funded lander from Israel, named Beresheet, Hebrew for \"in the beginning,\" crashes into the moon in 2019. A Japanese entrepreneur's company, ispace, launches a lunar lander in 2023, but it, too, wrecks. Astrobotic Technology, a Pittsburgh company, launches its lander in January, but a fuel leak prevents a landing and dooms the craft. Astrobotic and Intuitive Machines plan more moon deliveries.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Science and Educational Media Group.

        "title": "Amid global risks, investment themes for Thailand",
        "text": "The global economic and investment landscape at the beginning of 2024 bears some similarities to the start of last year. Stock markets that are performing well -- Japan, the US and Europe, as well as India -- have advanced in the range of 3-15%, while emerging markets such as Thailand, Hong Kong and China have shrunk by 2-5%.\n\nThis is in line with world economic data, in particular the purchasing managers' index (PMI) figures of large economies, which continue to expand.\n\nThe outlook is encouraging even though some important indicators such as GDP, retail sales and industrial production have slowed, amid falling inflation after central banks raised interest rates to the highest levels in decades. Overall, the world economy still faces a variety of risk factors, which can be described in three groups:\n\n1. Monetary policy risk: After two years of tightening monetary policy by central banks to eliminate inflation, concerns have arisen about the financial system, from rising bond yields to commercial real estate to the health of banks.\n\n2. Political and policy risks: Around 4 billion people worldwide will vote this year, with the US election likely commanding the most attention, which will come with unpredictable consequences.\n\n3. Geopolitical risks: From conflicts in Ukraine and Israel to the Red Sea and Taiwan, analysts are using terms such as \"polycrisis\" and \"new world disorder\" to describe rising anxiety levels.\n\nHowever, the global economy has been relatively resilient in the face of these risks. At the start of 2023, most economists thought a global recession would occur, but global GDP is still growing by around 3%.\n\nData from the US investment bank Goldman Sachs indicates global economic activity is as buoyant now as it was in 2019 before the pandemic. Weekly GDP readings produced by the OECD show similar results, while measures of global activity as reflected in PMI point to strong growth worldwide.\n\nImportant risk areas such as geopolitics do not appear to be a big problem. There's not much evidence indicating that attacks on shipping in the Red Sea are hurting the economy that much.\n\nPMI data suggests producers are factoring in longer delivery times as more cargo vessels and tankers take the long route around the Cape of Good Hope. This increases the distance between Shanghai and Rotterdam to 23,000km from 18,000km.\n\nIn any case, shipping costs are only a small part of overall product prices. As a result, inflation is likely to rise only slightly.\n\nOur analysis reveals geopolitical risks are increasing at an above-average rate. The Geopolitical Risk Index is 148.3, well above the average of 111.4 since 2020.\n\nHowever, it is lower than in the early months of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, when it reached 300.\n\nMeanwhile, economic policy risk, measured by the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, is 254.4, down from the three-year average of 263.9. This is likely because interest rates are starting to decrease as inflation falls, causing bond yields to decrease.\n\nIn light of these figures, our analysis found there is not much of a relationship between the economy and geopolitical risks. Meanwhile, reduced policy risks are helping the world economy to expand steadily.\n\nEven amid a polycrisis, we believe as long as geopolitical risks do not lead to a full-blown regional or world war, it is possible the global economy will continue to expand, albeit at a slower pace, but we should see a soft landing.\n\nYet we remain cautious as we have seen how higher interest rates retard growth.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war or a broader Middle East conflict could trigger another round of energy supply disruptions, leading to rising inflation.\n\nDOMESTIC WEAKNESS\n\nIn Thailand, the economy in the fourth quarter of 2023 expanded by 1.7% year-on-year, well below the market consensus of 2.5%, but close to our expectation of 1.8%.\n\nFull-year growth was a disappointing 1.9%. We have four observations about the Thai economy:\n\nGDP contracted in the fourth quarter by 0.6% from the previous quarter, seasonally adjusted. This was in line with many countries that also contracted, which indicates the global economy is weakening.\n\nThe Thai manufacturing sector has recently been characterised by under-production and continuous running down of inventories.\n\nIf the world economy performs this year as we predict -- slowing but with a soft landing -- Thai exports and manufacturing will face more risk.\n\nThai products face a challenge from Chinese market dumping. This is widening the Thai trade deficit at a time when China is supplying 9% of domestic consumer products -- up from 5% in 2020. If this trend continues, it will affect the Thai manufacturing sector.\n\nGiven the various risks, we adjusted our forecast for the Thai economy downward in 2024, based on two scenarios.\n\nIf the government's digital wallet stimulus is implemented, the economy will expand by 3.7% (down from an earlier forecast of 4.1%).\n\nWithout the digital wallet, we expect growth of 2.8% (down from 3.2% predicted earlier), while the Bank of Thailand may be able to cut interest rates twice this year.\n\nIn terms of investment strategy, we recommend selective buys based on two main themes: stocks expected to benefit from the recovery of the foreign tourist market, namely AOT and MINT; and long-term investments based on dollar-cost averaging, comprising BBL, BDMS, BEM, CPALL, PTT and SCC.",

Or even more sinister, considering Israel has not announced its future plans, the only other option is for the IDF to continue bombing them to ashes.\n\nThe casualty count, according to Palestinian sources, is over 29,000 dead and 7800 missing, with a further 69,000 wounded. Repeated attempts to reach the Palestine Ministry of Health website failed -- their Twitter account has also disappeared:\n\nIsrael has dropped 29,000 shells and bombs on Gaza since October 7, 2023. This greatly exceeds the 3,678 bombs dropped by the United States between 2004 and 2010 during its Invasion of Iraq.\n\nMore than half of all buildings in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed as of February 14, according to analysis of satellite imagery by a team of researchers at Oregon State University and the City University of New York. Somewhere between 156,000 and 190,000 buildings were destroyed.\n\nIsrael has broadened its theatre of operations and is conducting extensive airstrikes in Lebanon, targeting Hezbollah ammunition dumps, according to a recent report in Israel Radar:\n\n\"The IDF is amassing troops in the northern sector, while authorities are preparing for severe war scenarios behind closed doors. Intelligence expert Danny Citrinowicz warns that the risk of military escalation is extremely high. The former high-ranking IDF officer wrote that Hezbollah attacks on Israel will persist while the Gaza war continues, and that prospects for a diplomatic resolution are dim. A broader conflict appears almost inevitable as both sides escalate their strikes, he said.\"\n\n\"On that day, when the shooting stops in Gaza, we will stop the shooting in the south,\" he said in a televised address.\n\nHezbollah has vowed it will retaliate in its own time, and in this conflict, timing is everything. If Hezbollah were to launch a full-scale invasion of Israel, with an adjacent full-scale missile launch, it would trigger an immediate response from Israel's parter-in-crime, the United States.\n\nIt cannot be over stressed the extreme danger of this situation. If the USA responds to Hezbollah's assault, Iran could be dragged into the conflict which would, in turn, trigger possible nuclear weapons strikes by the USA. China gets 90% of its oil from Iran and any interruption of delivery would shut down the Chinese economy virtually overnight.\n\nRussia has a defence agreement with Iran, signed in 2019, with cooperative military exercises between the two countries and China. In 2016, Russia completed delivery of the S-300 air defence missile system to Iran, concluding an $800 million deal signed between the two states in 2007, state-run Russian press agency RIA Novosti reported. The S-300 mobile surface-to-air missile system can counter multiple aircraft at a range of 195 kilometers and ballistic missiles at a range of up to 50 kilometers.\n\nThese weapons are no doubt specifically reserved for defence against US aircraft. The ace in the hole that Iran holds is the potential to shut down the Strait of Hormuz which handles a third of the world's liquefied natural gas and almost 25% of total global oil consumption passes through the strait, making it essential for global trade. The devastation to the global economy would be unparalleled and increase tensions between East-West relations enormously.\n\n\"Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Colin Kahl offered one of the most striking US government assessments to date of Iran's \"breakout time\" as efforts to try to restore the Iran nuclear agreement remain halted and Tehran continues to breach the restrictions set out by the deal.\"\n\nAfter sorting through the lengthy list of models of how the world system operates, the most basic and plausible one is also the most accurate. In this hyper-complicated world, the simplest explanation to account for the facts is indeed correct. The generally accepted models are interesting, but fail to fully explain what we are experiencing at this moment in history.\n\nHowever, whether you are religious or not, the world is a global family. Even a scientific atheist will concede that human beings evolved from the same primordial ooze in shallow inland seas. We have the same common biological ancestors in the primate family. Atheists agree we are brothers and sisters, but reject the notion we have a spiritual parent.\n\nThe spiritual explanation is that we share the same Creator, mother-father and we are all brothers and sisters. This is the reality of mortal life in a universe of space and time.\n\nSome of the brothers and sisters have been very bad boys and girls.\n\nThe heads of the global family preside over 194 sub-families, comprised of nation-states. They are all agreed on a variety of mostly nefarious self-serving goals:\n\nAt the last G20 summit, in Delhi, India, The New Delhi Declaration was adopted, according to India's G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant, with \"100% consensus on all developmental and geo-political issues.\" I don't know which is worse, when the global leaders are all fighting with each other, or when they are all agreeing.\n\nThe only real bone of contention among the G20 leaders was disagreement over Russian's invasion of Ukraine, which \"most leaders\" condemned.\n\nThe truth is the larger more powerful nations like USA, Israel, Russia, China, Iran are fighting over resources and control of territory. The number one most sought-after and fought-over commodity is oil.\n\nAll the nations of the world are very aware that the current major restructuring of the global economic, political and social infrastructure is going to have winners and losers. They all want to guarantee their slice of the New World Order pie.\n\nThe Ukraine War and the Gaza War are just two fronts of the same long term project of the Western elites to rule the world, no matter what the consequences. On February 11th, it was announced that Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania will construct an \"extensive network of fortifications\" along the borders with Russia to deter Putin invading their countries. The total cost of the project is estimated at \u20ac60million ($65 million USD). This is a long term project, comparable to Nazi Germany building fortifications in Northern France.\n\nThe defence ministers of the three countries also signed a Letter of Intent for HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, aiming to create a framework for the joint use of the weapon system in both peace and wartime. Estonia and Latvia also signed a cooperation agreement to conduct NATO Air Policing from Latvia's Lielvarde air base. \"Air Policing\" is a euphemism for invading Russia's airspace with American F-35 jets.\n\n*\n\nNote to readers: Please click the share button above.

        "text": "As the bustling trade portion of the first fully post-pandemic Singapore Airshow wound down yesterday, exhibitors and delegates said they were optimistic for the aviation industry despite suppliers' struggles to keep up with the rebound in travel demand.\n\nBefore the show, organisers predicted that about 50,000 people would attend the four trade days of the show, nearly four times as many than in 2022, when foreign visitors required daily rapid antigen tests for Covid-19, and nearly as many as the 54,000 who visited in 2018.\n\nThe 2020 edition was rocked by last-minute cancellations as the virus spread around the world.\n\nOutside Asia's largest air show, transportation issues snarled arrivals and departures, especially during the first days.\n\nOn Tuesday, lines for free shuttle buses to the Expo public transportation hub led to waits as long as three hours in humid temperatures above 30\u00baC and taxis to the city cost as much as three times the usual fare.\n\nThe situation was bad enough to become a talking point, with local newspaper the Straits Times running a lengthy story headlined: \"'Worst transport experience': Crawling traffic, long waits for rides frustrate Singapore Airshow visitors\".\n\nLeck Chet Lam, managing director of show organiser Experia, said the company was aware of the transportation issues and attributed them to \"higher attendance than in previous editions\".\n\nIn the air-conditioned display space, commercial exhibitors hawked planes, drones, surveillance technology, services and equipment.\n\nThe displays attracted buyers as well as simple curiosity, with the Korea Aerospace Industries booth drawing a line on Wednesday for attendees to get pilots' autographs and pose for selfies.\n\nMore than 1,000 companies from 50 countries participated in this year's show, organisers said, on both the commercial and defence sides.\n\nRussian companies did not participate against the background of the war in Ukraine but Israeli companies Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which dropped out of the Dubai Airshow in November amid the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, attended.\n\n\"The general mood is extremely positive but also very demanding,\" said Dennis Kohr, head of corporate sales Asia-Pacific for aircraft maintenance provider Lufthansa Technik Group.\n\n\"It's the first airshow after the pandemic; there is not only a huge demand for air travel, but also huge demand for MRO services,\" he added, referring to maintenance, repair and overhaul.\n\nDelegates stepped into the tropical heat for about an hour's worth of aerial displays each day, including demonstration flights by air force teams from Singapore, Korea and India, among other countries, and a flyby by the C919, made by China's Comac.\n\nComac was the first company to announce orders at the show, flagging a deal with Tibet Airlines for 40 C919 single-aisle planes and 10 ARJ21 regional jets, plus 6 ARJ21s for China's Henan Civil Aviation Development and Investment Group.\n\nShortly afterward, Royal Brunei Airlines said it was ordering four Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners.\n\nAirbus announced an order for five A350 freighters and three A330neo widebody passenger jets from Taiwan's Starlux Airlines.\n\nAirbus also had a provisional deal with Vietnamese budget carrier VietJet for 20 A330neo wide-body airliners.\n\nSustainability was a focus of the show, with the Singapore government announcing a green jet fuel mandate to be funded by a levy on travellers and air show organisers stressing the importance of protecting the environment, but the industry showed divides over how to achieve its goal of \"net zero\" carbon emissions by 2050. -- Reuters",

        "text": "The plea from Bellevue Arts Museum for financial help from the community struck me as terribly sad as well as strange. Having volunteered there for over 50 years, I can certainly attest to the ups and downs.\n\nThe recent goal of $300,000 seems a ridiculous ask to actually \"save\" a museum. What it needs is millions; some for operating certainly, but most for a good-size endowment so it doesn't have to embarrass itself once more by closing or asking for help from the community.\n\nNow, in a most difficult time for the entire world, why should we prioritize saving a little museum in the middle of a shopping center? There must be someone in the neighborhood who will finally stand up and realize that Bellevue without a museum is just a shopping mall. Sadly, the arts aren't made a priority in the U.S. as they are in other countries. Perhaps it is a misunderstanding of what art can do for a community, a person, a country.\n\nThe misperception of what BAM does has always puzzled me. We are not just a gallery for pretty art that hangs on the wall or sits in the center of the floor. Not only have we had exhibits about every subject imaginable and by artists of all diverse backgrounds, but the museum has supported local artists before they were well-known; hosted outstanding international artists; provided learning opportunities for the community via lectures and workshops; and for years provided the only program where teens can become museum docents, thus learning presentation styles, how to talk with the public and how to use art as a tool to talk about diverse subjects.\n\nWe are a community center where people gather to learn. In just the past few years, they have been presented with conversations on Cambodia; Vietnam; Palestine; Israel; U.S. regions from north to south, east to west; homelessness; prisoners' \"last supper\" plates; displaced peoples from India and Pakistan, all in different mediums; and even today, an incredible Japanese paper exhibit. We have taken our visitors around the world, around the country, around our beautiful region with great conversations using the art and artists as tools to begin the talk.\n\nYes, BAM has made lots of mistakes and hasn't engaged well enough with the community. But BAM needs the funding to hire the right staff to do this -- strong leaders and development people. It needs an outstanding curator/director, which we have had before, to bring us exciting exhibitions. It needs the funding to bring outstanding exhibitions that will bring in people from all regions.\n\nThis is not a critique of the mistakes made, but a hope that someone, several someones, will step up to see the value of having such an extraordinary museum on the Eastside, one that fills the void around the arts being presented elsewhere and one that provides the value of learning to the community.",

        "title": "Nations, Nation-States, and Nationalism",
        "text": "Dear Reader (may the road rise up to meet you, and may your pants never be see-through),\n\nSo I'm going to do something a little different today. Before I explain what I'm doing, I'll explain the why.\n\nI've been writing a lot about Conservatism 101 stuff over the last year or so because a lot of folks have liberated themselves from what it actually is -- or was (I'm sure we'll see lots of examples of that at CPAC this weekend). Well, a key part of this Great Forgetting is nationalism. The Economist's cover story this week is about the need to take \"national conservatism\" seriously. (To be clear, they don't like it. But they also think it's not going away.) Nationalism is being sold by some as an alternative to conservatism and by others not as a replacement but as the \"true\" conservatism. They often sound like nationalism is some prince-in-exile who needs to be restored to the throne. Nationalism is the forgotten, authentic, or \"true\" conservatism.\n\nI think this is nonsense.\n\nBut I think confusion over nationalism extends beyond various quarters of the right. Here, for example, Politico's democracy reporter Heidi Przybyla (who I like personally), makes the bizarre claim that if you think your rights come from God, you're a \"Christian nationalist.\" I will audition for the annual World's Biggest Understatement Award and simply say that this claim is ... contestable. Meanwhile, the anti-Israel left has all manner of weird notions about nationalism, starting with the idea that a territory or region called by the Romans \"Palestine\" (as a way to snub the Jews) was actually a country that existed there before Israel and was a Jew-free country before 1948. (Spoiler: It was neither Jew-free nor a country, and Israel was there first.) And, of course, Vladimir Putin and his fans have all manner of very hot takes on what nations are and what nationalism means.\n\nSo I want simply to clarify what nationalism is -- and isn't. Or at least clarify my own understanding of it. So I'm going to make a down payment on explaining some basic concepts, at least as I see them. If you're not in the mood for such eggheady spelunking, that's cool. I'll talk to you next week.\n\nI'll start by asking a question: When does a country become a nation?\n\nThis might sound like a nonsense question, like \"what's the difference between a car and an automobile?\" That's because in everyday conversation, we use the two words interchangeably.\n\nBut if we're going to be precise, there's a real difference. A country is an area of land with a single government. A nation is a relatively coherent group of people who share a culture, language, ethnicity, or sense of common fate. The \"Kurdish nation\" is a thing, but the Kurds have no country (semiautonomous Iraqi Kurdistan notwithstanding). Scotland and England are two nations in one country. The nation of England is much older than the country of England. The \"Heptarchy\" of Anglo-Saxon England was made up of seven kingdoms (East Anglia, Essex, Kent, Mercia, Northumbria, Sussex, and Wessex) until that was consolidated into four kingdoms in the eighth century. In 927, England became a unitary country under \u00c6thelstan.\n\nAgain, terminology can get messy. But today we usually refer to countries as nation-states -- the nation part describes the people, the state part describes the government. But technically speaking, not all countries are nation-states. The oldest form of polity -- outside of clans, tribes, troops, etc. -- are city-states. The ancient world was full of somewhat identifiable nations that were divided up into city-states: Uruk, Ur, Thebes, Memphis, and, of course Rome, come to mind. But more to the point, we still have some city-states -- Monaco, Singapore, and the Vatican are independent city-states or countries, but they are not nation-states.\n\nIn short, it is important to keep in mind that the nation-state is a relatively recent invention, while the nation is much older. Indeed, most nation-states are pretty young.\n\nYou can meaningfully talk about the Greek nation going back thousands of years. But Greece didn't become a formal and sovereign nation-state until 1832. Belgium, where Julius Caesar faced some of his most fierce opposition (\"Of all the Gauls,\" Caesar famously said \"the Belgians are the bravest enemies I have ever faced\") became a country two years earlier, in 1830. Indeed, if you look at a map of Europe in the 1830s, the number of recognizable independent nations is comparatively small. There's France, Spain, England and a few more. But there are no independent nation-states of Germany, Austria, Poland, Slovakia, Czechia, Bosnia, Romania, or Ukraine (then controlled by the Hapsburgs and Russians). Germany until the 19th century was a nation, but not a nation-state. It was chock-a-block with various little independent kingdoms and \"states.\" Russia and Austria-Hungary were \"countries\" or \"states\" but they were composed of near-countless nations or countries.\n\nIn 1946 there were 36 nations in the United Nations. By 1970 the number was 127. The roster didn't expand nearly fourfold because a bunch of old countries decided to join the club for all the perks. Most became members once they became countries. This is one of the ironies of anti-colonialism. Lots of \"post-colonial \"countries are products of colonialism -- i.e. many colonies were transformed into countries by their colonizers who created within them a sense of nationhood that hadn't existed before. There's a school of thought that the British created India. \"India is a geographical term,\" Churchill once said. \"It is no more a united nation than the equator.\" There's a lot of debate about all that, but suffice it to say, there's some truth to the idea.\n\nWhat makes all of this even more otherworldly to the contemporary mind is that pretty much all of these countries, empires, and nation-states until very recently didn't \"belong\" to the people. They belonged to a network of families, or dynasties, which operated a lot like the Mafia. Each family had its territory. Some of these territories had been in the family for centuries. But the families were constantly looking to acquire more territory, often through war, but sometimes through marriage or barter (and usually the marriages were a form of sealing the deal of the barter). For millennia, the authority of royal dynasties derived from the fact that they descended from some warlord. This is what Albert Jay Nock was getting at when he said, \"The State's criminality is nothing new and nothing to be wondered at,\" he wrote. \"It began when the first predatory group of men clustered together and formed the State, and it will continue as long as the State exists in the world, because the State is fundamentally an anti-social institution, fundamentally criminal. The idea that the State originated to serve any kind of social purpose is completely unhistorical. It originated in conquest and confiscation -- that is to say, in crime.\"\n\nAnyway, the argument that \"nationalism\" is some ancient, natural, form of social organization is not very powerful. It's not entirely wrong, either. But it depends on a lot of historical cherry-picking. Yoram Hazony, if memory serves, claims that the idea of the nation-state comes from Israel and then is super-charged after the Protestant Reformation. Okay, maybe. Why not? But also, so what? There's a lot of history between ancient Israel and the 1600s, and very little of it supports the claim that the idea of nationalism -- or even what you might call nation-ism (which is what I think Hazony often really means) -- was very powerful. Certainly, all of those nations were still the playthings of kings and nobles.\n\nActual nationalism starts in the late 1700s in America -- a pretty unique case -- but really with the French Revolution. And it's been unfolding ever since. Earlier I noted the irony of colonial powers creating anti-colonial new nations. That, after all, is the story of America. It took a long time for the founding generation to see itself as something other than British. If King George had respected their claims to their \"ancient British rights and liberties,\" it's doubtful the United States would have become a nation, at least not for a long time.\n\nGerman nationalism is a more relevant example. It was basically ignited by the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic occupiers who aroused a sense of nationhood among the disparate German people. Interestingly, to me at least, the first German nationalists weren't really ethno-nationalists -- race science was in its infancy back then -- but linguistic nationalists. Vladimir Putin's nationalism often looks a lot like this. He talks about all Russian speakers, including in the Baltics and elsewhere, as if they are simply Russians.\n\nIndeed, Palestinian nationalism -- and one day nationhood -- is entirely a product of Israel's existence. Had there been no Israel in 1948, \"the Palestinians\" would be Arabs living in Egypt, Jordan, etc.\n\nToday, largely because of the atrophied vocabulary of contemporary politics, nationalism is cast as the opposite of liberalism. But that's not how it worked. The age of nationalism was also the age of democracy and the age of liberalism. America's Founders were nationalists, they were also liberals. Even in Europe, many -- maybe even most -- of the original nationalists were to one extent or other liberal in the classical sense (and in fairness to Hazony, despite his weird hatred of liberal theory, in practice he's still a liberal in that he's for democracy and the rule of law and all that stuff). Some liberal nationalists wanted democracy or \"republicanism,\" while others just wanted the rule of law, free speech, a free press, and the protection of property rights etc. Others didn't care much about that stuff, preferring instead to restore the sovereignty of their own royal rulers. However, what united all of them, to one extent or another, was the idea their nation should be its own country. Bohemia for the Bohemians and that kind of thing.\n\nThis brings us to another term that needs to be illuminated: \"popular sovereignty.\" This is the idea that the people are the real owners of the country they live in (of course, who counts as \"the people\" can be an ugly question -- just ask the Jews, Rohingya, Uyghurs, et al). Today popular sovereignty and democracy are pretty much synonymous, but that's not how it started. Initially, democracy -- often called republicanism, but that gets complicated too -- was just one form of popular sovereignty.\n\nDuring the 1800s there were plenty of nationalists whose idea of popular sovereignty meant being ruled by their own king or parliament of nobles, not some foreign ruler. Think of it this way: In Braveheart, Mel Gibson talks a lot about \"freedom,\" but he isn't talking at all about democracy -- he's talking about national liberation. Popular sovereignty could mean democracy or republicanism, but it could just as easily mean, \"We want one of our own to rule us.\" Woodrow Wilson's call for \"self-determination\" is often used by his apologists to suggest he favored democracy for everybody. But he didn't. It could mean democracy, but it could also mean that empires be broken up into sovereign nation-states that governed themselves as they saw fit.\n\nThis thinking is alive and well today, by the way. Lots of apologists for Hamas, Iran, Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, et al., often talk as if illiberal tyranny is just an authentic expression of these non-Western cultures and who are we to judge them, never mind impose our ideas on them?\n\nSo while all nationalists believe in popular sovereignty, not all nationalists believe in democracy. Adolf Hitler was a nationalist, he didn't have much use for democracy. Even Stalin, a Georgian and promoter of international socialism, became a Soviet and a really Russian nationalist once in power. Nationalists, contrary to Hazony's claims, can also be imperialists. Hitler wanted \"Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein F\u00fchrer,\" but he also wanted to subjugate inferior peoples' and nations. Xi Jinping is a nationalist and an imperialist; just ask the Tibetans and Uyghurs.\n\nThis raises another distinction. Hitler and Xi are ethnonationalists. Lots of liberal nationalists take great pains to insist -- often accurately and rightly -- that they are not ethno-nationalists. Liberal nationalists still believe in liberal democracy, to one extent or another. Ethnonationalists believe that the nation rightfully belongs to a single ethnicity, variously defined. Hitler's nationalism was reserved for Germans (or Teutons or Aryans), Xi's nationalism is less extreme, but he is a practitioner of Han supremacy. Mussolini was not an ethnonationalist, but he wasn't a liberal nationalist either. Rather, he was a cultural nationalist. Biological racism is a poor fit for an ethnically polyglot country like Italy.\n\nTo the extent you can call Israel \"nationalist,\" it is also liberal. Claims that it is ethnonationalist fall apart when you consider that it is a very multiethnic country, with citizens of every hue and faith. The freest Arabs in the Middle East are Arab-Israeli citizens. The Jews of Israel, meanwhile, come from Europe, but also North Africa and elsewhere in the Middle East. Critics like to erase these inconvenient facts by insisting that the country is comprised of settler-colonial oppressors from Europe. But the majority aren't of European descent. And the supermajority are Sabras -- Israelis who were born in Israel. If you want to say it's a religiously nationalist country, that's a defensible claim. But you should acknowledge that its liberalism is a profound check on this aspect of its character. Israel is far more religiously tolerant than most of its neighbors.\n\nI've thrown a lot of terminological distinctions at you. But there's a false distinction I should address as well. The communist left in the 1920s and 1930s insisted that \"nationalism\" and \"socialism\" are opposites. This claim was rooted in the Soviet Union's desire to have an uncontested monopoly on the concept and implementation of socialism. With the help of pronouncements like Stalin's \"Theory of Social Fascism,\" the left claimed that any socialist movement that wasn't loyal to Moscow, was \"right-wing.\" Sometimes they used the term \"right-wing socialism.\" With the rise of fascism and German national-socialism, this often got whittled down to \"right-wing\" or \"nationalist.\"\n\nBut in practice, extreme nationalist regimes were also socialist, and extreme socialist regimes inevitably became nationalist. Castro was a socialist. He was also a nationalist. Stalin was once an international socialist, but in order to stay in power he became a national-socialist (\"socialism in one country,\" \"great patriotic war for mother Russia,\" etc.). This is because socialism, like nationalism, has the same core logic. Any hindrance to the good of the collective, the people, the nation, is illegitimate. And therefore, for the good of the people, the state must have control of the means of production and the distribution of that product to ensure all of the people benefit. The distinction between socialism and nationalism on the ground is about marketing, not principle. Socialized medicine is nationalized health care.\n\nThis false distinction endures to this day, albeit in watered down form. I chuckle at the avowed nationalists of the right who rail against the \"socialists\" of the left, and vice versa, even as their proposed policies sound awfully similar. Elizabeth Warren's version of economic justice looks a lot like various notions of \"common good conservatism.\" The distinctions between these combatants on either side of the horseshoe have less to do with policy or principle and more to do with which team can claim the power of Tribune of the People.\n\nLet's talk about today's version(s) of nationalism. My first objection to nationalism is that absent qualifiers -- like \"liberal\" or \"benign\" -- nationalism (again like socialism) has no limiting principle. Nationalism purports to be concerned with what is good for \"the nation.\" Sounds good. But who defines good? One answer, not surprisingly offered by nationalist populists, is \"the people.\" But this is rhetorical mischief. Which people? What if the people are wrong? What if \"the people\" isn't everyone but just a faction of the people? Liberal democracy has answers to these questions. That's why the least offensive form of socialism is social democracy -- because it concedes that socialism needs to be curtailed and constrained by democracy. I rarely hear nationalists make a similar concession.\n\nUnqualified nationalism makes no such concessions. That's why non-liberal nationalist systems almost invariably become statist, socialist, or dictatorial. Because the state or \"the leader\" ends up being the only legitimate expression of the will of the people. When the leader does things that lots of people object to, the leader insists that those people do not have the nation's authentic interests at heart. When the legislature or the courts do something the leader doesn't want, the leader insists they are corrupt in some way. The logic of nationalism, absent legal or constitutional guardrails, leads almost inexorably to the claim that one person is the true expression of the Nation or the People. This is why I have always seen nationalism as a modern-sounding backdoor to a kind of monarchism. After all, this was the objection made by royalists in the face of rising notions of popular sovereignty: The king knows best what is best for the people. That is the argument made by Putin, Xi, Hitler, Mussolini, and the countless czars, emperors, kings, and Caesars deposed by nationalism.\n\nThis is why I maintain that patriotism and nationalism are different things. I am aware that this can be a forced distinction etymologically, so I'll put it this way: If patriotism doesn't mean what I think it means, we need a word to mean what I mean by patriotism. Nationalism is an unfettered mystical claim about abstract concepts like \"the people\" or \"the nation\" -- ill-suited for a multiethnic, religiously and culturally diverse liberal democratic nation grounded in a republican constitution. Meanwhile, patriotism, by my understanding, means fidelity to precisely these liberal and constitutional commitments. An American nationalist can -- and often does -- see the constitutional order as an impediment to the national will and therefore argue for overturning it or ignoring it. The patriot is loyal to that constitutional order and the ideals that inform it.\n\nI know I've gone very long here. But I need to answer the question I started with: When does a nation become a country? My short answer is, when it successfully stands up a government that is recognized by the people, and later by other countries. (I'd like to say, when it democratically stands up a government, but democracy is not essential here.)\n\nWhich brings me to Ukraine and the treason of the nationalists.\n\nIn Putin's tirades about Ukraine, he makes it clear that he subscribes to a pre-nationalist, pre-popular sovereignty, pre-modern theory of politics. He thinks that because Ukraine wasn't a country in the ninth or 13th century it can't be a country today -- at least not if he doesn't want it to be.\n\nThis is contrary to everything nationalists today claim to believe. And that is what is so disgusting about Putin's purportedly nationalist amen choir. Putin is not a nationalist, he's an imperialist. But the contemporary nationalists who wax righteous about rejecting the \"imperialism\" of the globalists and their institutions -- the U.N., the EU, the World Bank, Davos, whatever -- either cheer, mumble pro-forma objections, or simply stare at their shoes in silence as Putin attempts to erase a sovereign nation. The Ukrainians have their own language, their own culture, their own national history, and have been a nation for centuries. What they want to be is a country. And the allegedly nationalist Putinphiles are too ignorant or sycophantic to respect that desire because it conflicts with the ambition of a mass murderer and tyrant.\n\nPutin's apologists demonstrate that the real point of nationalism is the pursuit of power. Ideological nationalism is an attempt to provide a permission structure, to construct the slipperiest slope possible to their attainment of power. Nationalism, like \"post-liberalism,\" is an intellectual pretext, a means toward an end: power. After all, Putin is trampling every laudatory, beneficial, positive, historical aspect of nationalism -- national and popular sovereignty, democracy, liberalism, etc. -- but because he's powerful (in their eyes) that's okay. Because their nationalism was never really about nationalism; it was about power worship, at home, and abroad.\n\nVarious and Sundry\n\nCanine update: The Fair Jessica is still out of town. So I've been home alone with the beasts for a while and everyone's getting a little weird (and pushy). But some weirdness is weirder than others. Here's a story. Sometimes, when the garbage is full I'll tie up the bag and just put it outside the mudroom door at the top of the steps, figuring I'll just take it to the cans when I next leave the house. I did that Monday morning. Sometimes, if I do this at night and forget, racoons will come and make a giant mess. But that usually doesn't happen during the daytime. Anyway, I forgot about it and was working on my column. The dogs started barking at the back door. I got up and looked out the window and saw some workmen in the driveway we share with our neighbors. More barking. \"Quiet Zo\u00eb! It's fine,\" I said. She grumbled more. When it came time to go out for the midday walk, I leashed up Zo\u00eb and opened the door only to see the garbage bag had been torn open and all sorts of chicken bones and food containers were strewn about. \"Paydirt!\" quoth the Dingo and Spaniel. So I had to hurriedly pull them away from the garbage. In my haste I failed to close the mudroom door, but that was okay. I was just going to put them in the car, and then come back up and clean up the mess. So I open the Element and put Zo\u00eb in. I then turn to tell Pippa to get in, but something was wrong. Pippa looked very strange. But in the frenzy of the moment I couldn't figure out what it was. And then I shook my head like a hallucinating cartoon character and realized that the spaniel at my feet about to get in my car wasn't my spaniel. It was some new, different, spaniel. This raised two questions, one more obvious than the other: 1) Who is this spaniel? But also: 2) Where is my spaniel? Pippa, who always starts from the assumption that any strange dog is a mean dog, had gone off to hide in the bushes. Meanwhile this new spaniel wanted to get in the car and go to the park with us. Zo\u00eb did not like this plan. She started yelling at the interloper and even tried to jump out the open window to repel this invader. So I had to get into the car, turn it on, and close the window while holding onto Zo\u00eb to keep her from escaping while using my foot to keep the interloper from getting in the car. Good thing I'm so lithe. I managed to lock up the dingo and even get my spaniel in the car. But all the while the door was still open and Gracie was supervising the whole thing from the top of the steps. Then, I could hear Jaws music playing, which made me realize that Chester, the neighbor's cat who likes to bully Gracie, was land-swimming toward us. So I had to shoo away Chester while holding onto the new spaniel. That turned out to be fairly easy because the new spaniel wanted to hang out with me. Several times he just rolled on his back to ask for belly rubs (which I provided). I saw from his collar that his name was Monty. I really liked Monty, who I think is an American springer spaniel. I called the number on the tag, and his owner, a very nice lady, eventually came and got him.\n\nAnd I went on a bit of a tear about all of the right's \"Trump = Navalny\" B.S. on Anderson Cooper's show.",

        "title": "The issue with defining genocide",
        "text": "I only mention Dalrymple because he is one of a large number of people who have lost their...\n\nLike a number of \"anti-colonialists,\" William Dalrymple lives in colonial splendor on the outskirts of Delhi. The writer often opens the doors of his estate to slavering architectural magazines. A few years ago, one described his pool, pool house, vast family rooms, animals, cockatoo \"and the usual entourage of servants that attends any successful man in India's capital city.\"\n\nEither the Israelis weren't committing genocide, or they tried to commit genocide but are bad at it. Which is it?\n\nI only mention Dalrymple because he is one of a large number of people who have lost their senses by going rampaging online about the alleged genocide in Gaza. He recently tweeted at a young Jewish woman who said she was afraid to travel into London during the Palestinian protests: \"Forget 30,000 dead in Gaza, tens of thousands more in prison without charge, five MILLION in stateless serfdom, forget seventy-five years of torture, rape, dispossession, humiliation and occupation, IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU.\" It is one thing when a street rabble loses their minds. But when people who had minds start to lose them, that is another thing altogether.\n\nI find it curious. By every measure, what is happening in Gaza is not genocide. More than that -- it's not even regionally remarkable.\n\nHamas's own figures -- not to be relied upon -- suggest that around 28,000 people have been killed in Gaza since October. Most of the international media likes to claim these people are all innocent civilians. In fact, many of the dead will have been killed by the quarter or so Hamas and Islamic Jihad rockets that fall short and land inside Gaza.\n\nThen there are the more than 9,000 Hamas terrorists who have been killed by the Israel Defense Forces. As Lord Roberts of Belgravia recently pointed out, that means there is fewer than a two to one ratio of civilians to terrorists killed: \"An astonishingly low ratio for modern urban warfare where the terrorists routinely use civilians as human shields.\" Most western armies would dream of such a low civilian casualty count. But because Israel is involved (\"Jews are news\") the libelous hyperbole is everywhere.\n\nFor almost twenty years since Israel withdrew from Gaza, we have heard the same allegations. Israel has been accused of committing genocide in Gaza during exchanges with Hamas in 2009, 2012 and 2014. As a claim it is demonstrably, obviously false. When Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, the population of the Strip was around 1.3 million. Today it is more than two million, with a male life expectancy higher than in parts of Scotland. During the same period, the Palestinian population in the West Bank grew by a million. Either the Israelis weren't committing genocide, or they tried to commit genocide but are uniquely bad at it. Which is it? Well, when it comes to Israel it seems people don't have to choose. Everything and anything can be true at once.\n\nHere is a figure I've never seen anyone raise. It's an ugly little bit of math, but stay with me. If you wish, you might add together all the people killed in every conflict involving Israel since its foundation.\n\nIn 1948, after the UN announced the state, all of Israel's Arab neighbors invaded to try to wipe it out. They failed. But the upper estimate of the casualties on all sides came to some 20,000 people. The upper estimates of the wars of 1967 and 1973, when Israel's neighbors once again attempted to annihilate it, are very similar (some 20,000 and 15,000 respectively). Subsequent wars in Lebanon and Gaza add several thousands more to that figure. It means that up to the present war, some 60,000 people had died on every side in all wars involving Israel.\n\nOver the past decade of civil war in Syria, Bashar al-Assad has managed to kill more than ten times that number. Although precise figures are hard to come by, Assad is reckoned to have murdered some 600,000 Arab Muslims in his country. Meaning that every six to twelve months he manages to kill the same number as died in every war involving Israel ever.\n\nThere are lots of reasons you might give to explain this: that people don't care when Muslims kill Muslims; that people don't care when Arabs kill Arabs; that they only care if Israel is involved. Allow me to give another example that is suggestive.\n\nNo one knows how many people have been killed in the war in Yemen in recent years. From 2015-2021 the UN estimated perhaps 377,000 -- ten times the highest estimate of the recent death toll in Gaza. The only time I've heard people scream on the streets about Yemen has been after the Houthis started attacking American and British ships in the Red Sea and the deadbeat idiots on the streets started chanting: \"Yemen, Yemen, make us proud, turn another ship around.\" Because like all leftists and Islamists there is no terrorist group these people can't get a pash on, so long as that terrorist group is against us.\n\nI often wonder why this obsession arises when the war involves Israel. Why don't people trawl along our streets and scream by their thousands about Syria, Yemen, China's Uighurs or a hundred other terrible things? There are only two possible conclusions.\n\nThe first is a journalistic one. Ever since Marie Colvin was killed it became plain that western journalists were a target in Syria. Not eager to be the target, most journalists hotfooted it out of the country. Some who didn't fell into the hands of ISIS. Israel-Gaza wars by contrast do not have the same dynamic and on a technical level the media can applaud itself for reporting from a warzone where they are not the target.\n\nBut I suspect it is a moral explanation which explains the situation so many people find themselves in. They simply enjoy being able to accuse the world's only Jewish state of \"genocide\" and \"Nazi-like behavior.\" They enjoy the opportunity to wound Jews as deeply as possible. Many find it satisfies the intense fury they feel when Israel is winning.\n\nLike being fanned on your veranda while lambasting the evils of empire, it is a paradox, to be sure. But it is also a perversity. And it doesn't come from nowhere.",

Despite Israel's heightened need for ammunition due to ongoing operations, it has ensured that exports to India, particularly radars, remain unimpeded.\n\nThe report quoting both the sources stated that the officials\n\nemphasized that Israel has taken measures to guarantee a consistent supply of weapons, including drone components, to New Delhi. This commitment has allowed India to maintain its defense capabilities, underscoring the resilience of the defense partnership between the two nations.\n\n\"We made sure our (military) exports to India are not impacted,\" the Israeli official told Reuters\n\nDespite the conflict, Israeli arms manufacturers have re-entered the international stage, showcasing their products at the Singapore Airshow. The return to global events signals Israel's confidence in its defence industry's ability to operate amid challenging geopolitical circumstances.\n\nAccording to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, India has emerged as the foremost importer of arms globally, having purchased $37 billion worth of military hardware between 2012 and 2022.\n\nIn the past decade, India has sourced weaponry predominantly from Russia, with transactions totaling $21.8 billion.

        "text": "\"If you can see what is happening in the South China Sea, and Red Sea where people are seeking to impose their will on the global commons... then that ripple will be felt far and wide, and not just in that point. And, this is what separates the maritime environment from the land environment,\" Adm Key said.\n\nNavies will have to work in partnership, because no one navy can cover all the points of the world at the same time, he said, adding, \"We are so intertwined that actually we are obligated to work together.\" \"And, we are just having to adapt ourselves, for the first time that in many decades, the fact that the global commons are contested in a way that they have not been for a long time, and the impact of that, if we do not respond, will be felt by us all, not by only those who are in the locality where the contestation is taking place,\" he said.\n\nAdm Vaujour made reference to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and said the paradigm was shifting from a \"competition world\" towards a \"contestation and confrontation world\".\n\n\"We were competitive altogether and it was good, free flow of commerce...and now, everything is contested, not only the global commons are contested, and the sea is a global commons, but also sovereignty of the state is contested, and sovereignty is not only small islands... it is also financial, economic, where all the pillars of sovereignty are contested,\" he said.\n\nThe French admiral cited the example of the Black Sea and how the Russia-Ukraine conflict is playing out in that region.\n\n\"My (French) Navy is a big navy, but not the biggest one, we are not able to do it alone. We need partnership, we need partnership to ensure and to respond to all the crises in the world right now, to provide stability, to reduce risks, and restore confidence,\" he added.\n\nAdmiral Kumar, in his address, said it is very evident right from the history of Athens that all those who have neglected the seas, have \"paid a very heavy price\", especially if it is a maritime nation.\n\nAnd, when you look at the conflicts that are happening, whether it is Ukraine-Russia or Israel-Hamas, it is very evident, the changing character of warfare is very much true. It is \"changing like a chameleon, we need to therefore adapt to the use of modern technology, niche technology, which are becoming more and more affordable,\" he added.\n\nThe cost of such technology is actually becoming lesser and lesser, with greater capabilities and the same is being adapted by non-state actors and even state-funded actors to carry out attacks or asymmetric warfare, he added.\n\nAdm Aquilino said a lot of what everyone wants to talk about is the ways, so, whether it is the swarms of civilian fishing boats or military militia disguised as fishing boats, whether it is swarms of drones driven by a non-state actor or a small state actor to deliver effects, \"we got to look at what is the purpose of the actions\".\n\n\"So, whether it is the illegitimate, illegal war that Russia has waged against Ukraine, whether it is terrorist organisations yielding incredible devastations against civilian populations,\" he added.\n\nAdm Aquilino said the strategy of the US is to \"deliver a free and open Indo-Pacific, that is not for one nation, that is all for all nations\".\n\n\"The imposition of a man-made island to extend your EEZ, so through legal means you can claim that you now own all of the South China Sea. That's the problem for all nations, it is not just a problem for the US,\" he said, adding, \"We can't do it alone, and we are stronger when we do it together\".\n\nHe also asserted that the US-India relationship has certainly \"grown exponentially\", and added that \"our ability to share information is like never before. Some of that is based on actions that occurred on the Indian northern border\".\n\nAir Marshal Chipman said Australia sees the Indo-Pacific as the \"epicentre of great power competition between China and the US\", adding it has tried to uphold its values in Australia.\n\n\"The network of allies and partners that we build in our region, like-minded group of nation that are committed to international law, the principles of human rights and the principles of sovereignty of nations, it is that network of nations that will help us stand tall and deter coercion and deter military aggression in the region,\" he said.\n\nIn response to a query, he added, \"All nations in the region are coming to the conclusion that they need to invest in their own strength and they need to work with allies and partners in order to maintain and preserve the balance of power in the region.\" PTI KND SKY SKY",

        "title": "'Odie' takes US back to Moon after 52 years; first pvt craft soft-lands | World News - Times of India",
        "text": "Soft-landing on Moon is hard. Yes, even if you've been-there, done-that, as the US learnt with Nasa's commercial partner Astrobotic's Peregrine mission's failure in Jan. But just weeks later, early on Friday, another Nasa commercial partner, Intuitive Machines, made history with the first American soft landing on the lunar surface in half a century. Intuitive Machines is the first private firm to land on Moon.\n\nThe company's Nova-C lander, named Odysseus and nick-named Odie, is \"upright and sending data\" from Moon after some tense moments faced by the IM-1 mission, carrying Odie, just before landing.\n\nOdie, which lifted off Feb 15 (US time) on a SpaceX Falcon 9, was placed on trajectory to Moon. The spacecraft performed two trajectory correction manoeuvres before entering a low lunar orbit Feb 21 and landing on Moon on Feb 22, just a week after launch.\n\nThe IM-1 mission carried six Nasa payloads through the latter's Commercial Luar Payload Services (CLPS) programme. The Nasa contract is valued at $118 million but the overall mission cost is estimated to be close to $200 million, including launch cost.\n\nComparatively, India's Chandrayaan-3, which made history on Aug 23, 2023, took 40 days from launch to land given that India's used a less powerful rocket to launch. India spent around $72 million. While Vikram weighed 1,752kg, while Odie weighed 675kg as unlike the Indian lander, Odie wasn't carrying a rover inside it.\n\nUS' second Moonrush\n\nLanding Odie, a phone booth-size spacecraft, isn't significant only because the US hasn't been on Moon after 1972 -- Apollo 17 -- but because it in many ways \"opens the door\" to future lunar explorations, especially in the south polar region. In that sense, the name Odysseus is apt. Remember the Trojan Horse?\n\nDuring the space race, Soviet Union's Luna 9 became the first spacecraft to soft-land on Moon in Feb 1966, which was followed and another successful landing of Luna 10 in March.\n\nSurveyor 1, which landed in May 1966, was the first successful landing on a US spacecraft on Moon, which paved the way for the famous Apollo programme which saw multiple astronauts landing on the lunar surface -- US is still the only country to have sent humans to Moon -- before coming to an end with Apollo 17.\n\nSince then only three other countries -- China, India and Japan -- have soft-landed. And in 2018, US declared Moon of strategic interest and refocused Nasa on returning sustainably under Artemis.\n\nThe renewed US interest also saw the launch of the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) as part of which, Nasa, in 2019 awarded Intuitive Machines its first task order to land a suite of payloads on Moon.\n\nIM-1 mission\n\nIM-1 is a step in lunar exploration, rekindling humanity's quest to Moon and signifies not only a return to the lunar surface after a hiatus of several decades but also a bold leap into a new era of commercial lunar science and exploration.\n\nIM-1 was aimed at creating a commercial lunar economy, delivering commercial payloads and Nasa science and technology payloads that will pave the way for a sustainable human presence on and around the Moon.\n\nPayloads on Odie are expected to operate for roughly seven days before the lunar night sets on the south pole of the Moon.\n\nWhile Nasa payloads on Odie -- including a navigation Doppler lidar, a navigation beacon, a radiofrequency fuel tank gauge, a camera to study dust plumes kicked up by the lander's engine, a laser retroreflector and a radio astronomy instrument -- emphasise technology demonstrations, it also carries six non-Nasa payloads.\n\nLanding site\n\nMalapert A, is a satellite crater to Malapert in south pole region was chosen as the landing site as the area around it is believed to be made of lunar highland material similar to Apollo 16's landing site.\n\nAlso, the nearby Malapert Massif is one of the 13 candidate regions being considered for Nasa's Artemis III mission.\n\nCLPS\n\nThrough CLPS, IM-1 is part of a broader strategy to foster a sustainable presence on Moon, facilitating scientific discovery, resource utilisation, and development of lunar infrastructure. The knowledge and experience gained from this mission will be invaluable in shaping future missions to the Moon and beyond, just like learnings from India's Chandrayaan-3 or recent missions by Japan and China.\n\nIntuitive Machines says: \"As humans, we must inspire and be inspired, whether, in pursuit of a medical breakthrough or exploring our solar system, we are endlessly drawn to the progress of humanity. Less than a decade ago, Intuitive Machines was an idea... Now, we're extending our lead in the development of lunar space, and we are inspired by where the next decade and beyond will take us.\"\n\nFuture missions\n\nIf Asian Moon missions dominated 2024 -- both successful and failed missions by Israel, China, Japan and India -- this year will see multiple US missions, while China and Japan are eyeing Moon too. India's joint mission with Japan, (Lunar Polar Exploration Mission or Lupex), initially targeted for 2024-25, is most likely to get postponed.\n\nAnalysis done at the time Russia's failed Luna-25 and Chandrayaan-3 were heading to Moon, they were only the first among at least 10 other lunar missions planned between 2023 and 2025.\n\nThe US has CLPS, Trailblazer, VIPER (Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover) and Artemis-II, China has multiple missions under the China's Lunar Exploration Programme, Israel is planning Beresheet-2 and Japan will launch Hakuto-II & III.\n\nPre-Odie: Plans from Napkin to Moon\n\nIn 2012, co-founder & CEO Steve Altemus found inspiration during a casual dinner with co-founder Kam Ghaffarian and jotted down the initial blueprint for Intuitive Machines on a napkin. This idea sparked the innovation that would drive the company's mission to create cutting-edge solutions to solve some of humanity's most formidable challenges.\n\nNaming Odie\n\nIntuitive Machines named its 130kg payload capacity lander class of vehicles Nova-C -- Nova means new, and C is Roman numeral for 100. Then came the time to give the IM-1 lander a proper name and over two weeks, employees suggested names on a whiteboard.\n\nThree names were shortlisted: Archimedes (Archie) Geraldyn Cobb (Molly, Jerrie, Cobby) and Odysseus (Odie).\n\nOdysseus was nominated by assembly, integration, and test engineer, Mario Romero. Romero justified it thus: \"For those who remember the epics The Iliad & The Odyssey, Odysseus (the wise & courageous) was the genius who devised the Trojan horse. But his adventure truly began after the Trojan War. His voyage should have been a quick, straight shot back home to Penelope in Ithaca; however, this journey takes much longer due to the many challenges, setbacks, and delays. Travelling the daunting, wine-dark sea repeatedly tests his mettle, yet ultimately, Odysseus proves worthy and sticks the landing back home after ten years.\"",

        "text": "With these words America announced its return to the surface of the Moon for the first time in 52 years.\n\nThe US-based company Intuitive Machines successfully landed its Odysseus lunar robot near the Moon's south pole yesterday morning Australian time.\n\nIt's the first time a privately built vehicle has soft-landed on the surface.\n\nThe lander was launched from Earth by Elon Musk's SpaceX and carried an array of scientific instruments, including six for the US space agency NASA.\n\nAfter last-minute difficulties and a nail-biting wait, the company confirmed the vehicle was upright and transmitting data.\n\nExperts say the success of the mission will lead to a surge of public and private investment in lunar missions.\n\nHere are some of our readers' questions, answered.\n\nAn American vehicle hasn't softly touched down on the Moon's grey dirt since NASA's Apollo 17 lander -- and its crew -- did so in December 1972.\n\nAt the time, the US promoted the Apollo missions as achievements for all humanity.\n\nResponding to the Odysseus news, NASA administrator Bill Nelson echoed some of that Space Age rhetoric.\n\n\"What a triumph! Odysseus has taken the Moon,\" he said in a video message.\n\n\"This feat is a giant leap forward for all of humanity. Stay tuned!\"\n\nLike in the Cold War, soft power is one reason to go to the Moon, said Alice Gorman, a space archaeologist at Flinders University.\n\n\"This is a matter of national prestige,\" she said.\n\nThis time, America's main rival is China, said Paddy Neumann, a rocket scientist with the University of Adelaide.\n\n\"America wants to show it can still compete in this area.\"\n\nIn the past 11 years, China has landed unmanned craft on the Moon three times and even brought back lunar samples.\n\nNASA's Artemis program aims to send astronauts back to the Moon, including the first woman, as soon as 2026.\n\nThe scientific instruments on board IM-1 will pave the way for this proposed moon base, including helping study the behaviour of lunar dust, which can scratch and clog equipment.\n\n\"One of the big unsolved problems is how to do anything on the Moon's surface without lunar dust getting in the way,\" Dr Gorman said.\n\n\"People are assuming this problem will be solved.\"\n\nNo. There's a mix of other scientific and commercial reasons to go the Moon.\n\nFirst, frozen water in permanently shadowed craters near the south pole could be used to manufacture fuel for missions to Mars.\n\n\"The question used to be asked, 'Should we go to the Moon or Mars?' And now the answer is, 'We go to the Moon and Mars,'\" Dr Gorman said.\n\nThat is, the Moon could be a Mars staging post.\n\nBut why go to Mars? Partly because it's there, Dr Gorman said.\n\n\"Mars is symbolic.\"\n\nDr Neumann said going to Mars was an extension of humanity's \"seemingly innate desire to see what's over the next hill\".\n\nThere are also scientific reasons to make the long trip to the Red Planet, including the chance of finding extraterrestrial microbial life there -- or at least fossil evidence that it once existed.\n\nBut the Moon isn't just a stepping stone to Mars. There are long-term plans to mine the surface for metals such as iron, titanium and aluminium, either for constructing machines and buildings on the Moon, or to send back to Earth.\n\nThe Moon is also home to a rare isotope helium-3 that -- in theory -- could be used to power fusion reactors.\n\n\"We don't have the fusion reactors ready for that,\" Dr Neumann noted.\n\nYes! Several.\n\nAs mentioned, in 2020 China's Chang'e-5 brought the first lunar samples back to Earth in more than 40 years.\n\nIn August last year, India's Chandrayaan-3 became the first craft to land near the Moon's south pole.\n\nAnd in January this year, Japan's \"Moon sniper\" lunar probe, SLIM, successfully touched down as well.\n\nOther countries - such as Israel, South Korea and numerous member states of the European Space Agency - have also placed robotic spacecraft into lunar orbit.\n\n\"There is a much greater diversity of players now,\" Dr Gorman said.\n\n\"It's actually good to have more than the US and Russia out there.\"\n\nThe Australian Space Agency is building a semi-autonomous rover that will launch to the Moon as early as 2026 in partnership with NASA.\n\nNASA administrator Bill Nelson said in January that the US was in a \"space race\" with China.\n\n\"We better watch out that they don't get to a place on the Moon under the guise of scientific research,\" he said.\n\nBut many scientists are critical of this terminology, for different reasons.\n\nDr Gorman said it emphasised competitiveness not cooperation, when the idea of space as a common province of humanity is enshrined in law.\n\nThe 1967 Outer Space Treaty signed by a majority of countries establishes that space will be freely explored and used by all nations.\n\nDr Neumann said the term \"race\" implied that, at some point, there would be an end to the exploration.\n\n\"But space goes on forever,\" he said.\n\nThat said, the Moon doesn't go on forever. Even though countries can't claim sovereignty over a patch of the lunar surface, there are ways to effectively control an area, Dr Neumann said.\n\nIndia, which was instrumental in identifying water on the Moon in 2008, is also targeting the south pole.\n\nThe ideal lunar real estate is an area with mountains in permanent sunlight, which can be used to generate solar, near a deep, permanently shadowed crater where there's ice.\n\n\"And if you get there and put your base on that mountain-top first, then congratulations. But commiserations for everyone else, because they'll have to either talk to you nicely and cooperate, or pick another mountain top that's not so good.\"\n\nIn 2020, the US drafted the \"Artemis Accords\" establishing a framework for cooperation in the exploration and peaceful use of the Moon, Mars and other astronomical objects.\n\nSo far, 36 parties, including Australia, India, Japan and the US, but not China, have signed the non-binding agreement.\n\nDr Neumann said there seem to be two power blocs forming.\n\n\"One is led by the Chinese, one is led by the Americans.\"\n\nThe past four years have seen companies from Israel, Japan and the US launch failed lunar missions.\n\nThen there's all the other emerging space services companies, from SpaceX to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin.\n\nThese private companies have so far mostly survived on fat public sector contracts, Dr Gorman said.\n\nNASA paid Intuitive Machines US$118 million to help develop the IM-1 mission.\n\nAnd that's just the beginning. NASA has earmarked billions in private sector spending to support its space program.\n\nUnlike in the Apollo era, NASA's strategy is to let private companies handle routine missions at lower cost.\n\nThe goal is to ultimately develop what it calls a \"lunar economy\" where private companies buy and sell services, such as habitation and transport, or resources, such as oxygen or water.\n\nDr Neumann, who's also the founder of an Australian company developing propulsion systems and other technologies, said venture capitalists see money to be made on the Moon.\n\n\"It puts the venture into venture capital,\" he said.\n\nThe success of the mission will ultimately embolden NASA and space-faring private companies, Dr Neumann said.\n\n\"If one small company can do it, other small companies can.\"\n\nThis will be good news for Australia's growing commercial space sector, as well as local companies that operate ground stations for communication between the Earth and the Moon.\n\nIn May, China plans to launch the Chang'e-6 mission to bring back samples from the far side of the Moon.\n\nNASA also plans to send several robotic rovers and satellites to the Moon to search for water later this year.\n\nAnd the upcoming Artemis II mission planned for next year will see four astronauts loop around the Moon and return to Earth.\n\nDr Gorman agreed that the successful landing would see more private and public investment in going to the Moon.\n\n\"There'll be an impetus to increase the number of these commercial partnerships,\" she said. \"It changes the narrative around the Moon.\"\n\nApart from the investment dollars, she added, the mission could mark another more subtle change.\n\nYears from now, we may look back on this week's landing as a historic step towards the commercial exploitation of the Moon's resources.\n\n\"This is happening really quickly,\" Dr Gorman said.\n\n\"The Moon is is turning from the beautiful pearly object hanging in the sky ... to an industrial site.\"",

        "text": "SINGAPORE: Record numbers attended the trade section of the first fully post-pandemic Singapore Airshow this week, with exhibitors and delegates optimistic about the aviation industry despite suppliers' struggles to keep up with rebounding travel demand.\n\nClose to 60,000 people attended the four trade days of the show, nearly four times as many as in 2022 when foreign visitors required daily rapid tests for Covid-19, and more than the 54,000 who visited in 2018. The 2020 edition was rocked by last-minute cancellations as the virus spread around the world.\n\nOutside Asia's largest air show, transport problems snarled arrivals and departures, especially during the first days. On Tuesday, lines for free shuttle buses to the Expo public transport hub led to waits as long as three hours in temperatures over 30 degrees Celsius and taxis to the city cost as much as three times the usual fare.\n\n\"'Worst transport experience': Crawling traffic, long waits for rides frustrate Singapore Airshow visitors\", ran a headline in local newspaper the Straits Times.\n\nLeck Chet Lam, managing director of show organiser Experia, blamed \"higher attendance than in previous editions\".\n\nIn the air-conditioned display space, commercial exhibitors hawked planes, drones, surveillance technology, services and equipment. The displays attracted buyers and enthusiasts, with the Korea Aerospace Industries booth drawing a line on Wednesday for attendees to get pilots' autographs and pose for selfies.\n\nMore than 1,000 commercial and defence companies from 50 countries participated in the show, organisers said.\n\nRussian companies did not take part amid the war in Ukraine but Israeli companies Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, which dropped out of the Dubai Airshow in November amid the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, attended.\n\n\"The general mood is extremely positive but also very demanding,\" said Dennis Kohr, head of corporate sales Asia-Pacific for aircraft maintenance provider Lufthansa Technik Group.\n\n\"It's the first air show after the pandemic; there is not only a huge demand for air travel, but also huge demand for MRO services,\" he added, referring to maintenance, repair and overhaul.\n\nNatasha Pheiffer, regional managing director for Asia at British defence firm BAE Systems, said it was great to see attendees face to face again.\n\n\"We had a really busy week ... discussing future air capability, our space and autonomous air technologies, our cyber, electronic warfare, sea, and land offering and our presence across Asia,\" she said.\n\nDelegates stepped into the tropical heat for around an hour of aerial displays each day, including demonstration flights by air force teams from Singapore, South Korea and India, among others, and a fly-by by the C919, made by China's COMAC. It was the first flight outside Chinese territory for COMAC's homegrown jet.\n\nCOMAC was also the first company to announce orders at the show, flagging a deal with Tibet Airlines for 40 C919 single-aisle planes and 10 ARJ21 regional jets, plus six ARJ21s for China's Henan Civil Aviation Development and Investment Group.\n\nShortly afterwards, Royal Brunei Airlines said it was ordering four Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners.\n\nAirbus announced an order for five A350 freighters and three A330neo widebody passenger jets from Taiwan's Starlux Airlines. Airbus also had a provisional deal with Vietnamese budget carrier VietJet for 20 A330neo wide-body airliners.\n\nSustainability was in focus, with Singapore announcing a green jet fuel mandate to be funded by a levy on travellers and air show organisers stressing the importance of protecting the environment, but the industry remains divided over how to achieve its goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nSupply chain issues clouded some of the show's optimism, with exhibitors citing long lead times and high costs, which have dogged the industry since Covid and worsened after Russia invaded Ukraine. The problems have been especially acute for raw materials such as aerospace-grade metals.\n\nStill, Paul Bolton, chief operating officer of First Aviation Services, was hopeful the worst was over and that growing demand would lead manufacturers back to aerospace production.\n\n\"It will get better in maybe two to three years,\" he said. - Reuters",

        "text": "A Lithograph of the Waterloo Creek Massacre in Australia where European colonists murdered Indigenous people settler\n\nDefining Israel as a settler colonial state isn't some academic exercise. It helps us describe its nature and shapes our hopes of how the Palestinians can win.\n\nAs author Ilan Pappe points out, \"The idea that Zionism is settler colonialism is not new. Palestinian scholars in the 1960s did not frame Israel as just a British colony or an American one, but regarded it as a phenomenon that existed in other parts of the world -- settler colonialism.\"\n\nHe adds, \"The most important logic adopted by settler colonial movements is that in order to create a successful settler colonial community outside of Europe, you have to eliminate the natives in the country you have settled\".\n\nThe view that settler colonialism always means wiping out people who live in an area fits with the horrendous experience in Australia, North America and Canada.\n\nSettler colonialists quite deliberately exterminated nearly all the Indigenous people in these territories to seize their land and found a \"new state\".\n\nAs Karl Marx wrote, \"The extirpation, enslavement and entombment in mines of the aboriginal population, the beginning of the conquest and looting of the East Indies, the turning of Africa into a warren for the commercial hunting of black-skins, signalled the rosy dawn of the era of capitalist production.\"\n\nEven the mainstream Australia Museum says, \"Because of colonial genocidal actions like state-sanctioned massacres, the First Nations population went from an estimated 1-1.5 million before invasion to less than 100,000 by the early 1900s.\"\n\nWhen imperialists didn't murder all of the native population, they crammed them into overcrowded and barren areas, destroyed their distinctive cultures and sought to wipe out their languages.\n\nThey stole their children or forced them into education systems defined by the supremacy of the oppressor. When the Zionists spoke of Palestine as, \"A land without a people for a people without a land\", they followed a murderous tradition. For example, genocide in Tasmania, California and Namibia began with the common lie that the land was \"empty\" or \"unclaimed\".\n\nThe British in Australia employed a doctrine of terra nullius, or \"land where nothing exists\". In Namibia, colonists imposed a policy of \"creating a map scraped smooth\".\n\nAnd, just as in Israel, other settler colonialists buttressed this exclusion of thriving Indigenous cultures with racist myths that those who inhabited the regions were not fully human, or lesser humans.\n\nBenjamin Madley, a historian of genocide, wrote, \"In Tasmania, colonists who seized Aboriginal children and dashed their brains out or lined Aborigines up as targets for musket practice likely considered their victims less than human.\n\n\"Whites spoke of Aborigines as 'horribly disgusting,' 'constituting in a measure the link between man and the monkey tribe,' or 'undoubtedly in the lowest possible scale of human nature, both in form and intellect.'\n\n\"Many white settlers in California considered the Yuki (a group of Native Americans) subhuman.\n\n\"Why else would settler Dryden Lacock proudly brag that he routinely joined Yuki-massacring parties while his neighbour Hank Larrabee boasted of killing 60 Yuki children with his hatchet?\"\n\nAn 1859 letter from the notorious \"Indian-killer\" Walter Jarboe to the governor of California describes the Yuki as \"the most degraded, filthy, miserable thieving lot of any living thing that comes under the head and rank of human being\".\n\nA missionary named Eiger in Namibia suggested that \"the average German looks down upon the natives as being about on the same level as the higher primates (baboon being their favourite term for the natives) and treats them like animals. The settler holds that the native has a right to exist only in so far as he is useful to the white man.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean that settler colonialism only involves mass violence supported by racism. What's sometimes called \"franchise colonialism\" -- where the imperialists rule from afar and exploit people rather than slaughter them all -- also involves such crimes. This form of colonialism in India was particularly deadly.\n\nIn the 1876-8 Indian famine alone, over six million Indians starved to death while the British imperialists exported food from their country.\n\nIt was the same foul crime committed against the Irish peasantry 30 years before. In his book Late Victorian Holocausts, Mike Davis argued, \"Between 1875-1900 -- a period that included the worst famines in Indian history -- annual grain exports increased from 3 to 10 million tons\", equivalent to the annual nutrition of 25 million people.\n\n\"By the turn of the century, India was supplying nearly a fifth of Britain's wheat consumption at the cost of its own food security.\"\n\nThe British Viceroy of India, Lord Lytton, spurned all pleas to reduce the suffering of millions of peasants in the Madras region and concentrated on preparing for Queen Victoria's investiture as Empress of India.\n\nThe highlight of the celebrations was a week-long feast at which 68,000 dignitaries heard the queen promise the nation \"happiness, prosperity and welfare\".\n\nIn the rural areas outside Madras, people died from hunger and thirst -- as the empire's guests gorged on the finest produce shipped in from across the globe at massive expense.\n\nNor is it true that settler colonial states always reject intense exploitation of the subject population in favour of complete butchery.\n\nThe clearest example is South Africa where there were internal battles among colonisers over whether to eliminate black people, enslave them or suck value from them through wage labour.\n\nIn the end, imperialist capitalists forced black people to work in the mines. These produced huge profits but also proved to be the downfall of the apartheid system once black workers organised and rose against the system.\n\nIndigenous people are not objects or simply victims. They fight back -- and settler colonialism uses this to frame their mass murder as \"defensive\".\n\nUS General Philip Sheridan -- believed to be the originator of the disgusting phrase, \"The only good Indian is a dead Indian\", was an expert in such formulas. He wrote in the 1870s, \"If an Indian village is attacked and women and children killed, the responsibility is not with the soldiers but with the Indians whose crime necessitated the attack.\"\n\nHistorian Jacob P Dunn told his readers in 1886 that the killing of Indian women and children was justified by \"vengeance\" and by the need to \"dampen\" the enthusiasm of Indian warriors to resist American expansion.\n\nEvery example of settler colonialism has its specific features, and Israel does not fit neatly into a simple categorisation. But the Zionist coloniser borrowed and used some tried and tested settler colonial methods to extert their grip on Palestine.\n\nSettlers pretended to themselves and others that they were settling on uninhabited land. They used and continue to use racism against Arabs. They murder, remove and seek to demonise those they oppress. And, just as after 7 October, they say their genocidal policy is \"defensive\".\n\nAll that worked in the 19th century but today billions of people across the world recognise in the Palestinian struggle an echo of their own desire to rise against a racist, brutally unequal world order.\n\nThe lies about defensive violence and the slurs of antisemitism when we criticise Israel may impress prime ministers, presidents -- and leaders of polite opposition parties. But they convince fewer and fewer ordinary people.\n\nIt's why Ilan Pappe said recently that he believed we are just at the start of \"two years that will witness the worst kind of horrors that Israel can inflict on the Palestinians. But even in this dark moment we should understand that settler colonial projects that disintegrate always use the worst kind of means to try and save their project.\n\n\"I am not saying this as wishful thinking and I am not saying this as a political activist. I am saying this as a scholar. On the basis of sober professional examination, I am stating that we are witnessing the end of the Zionist project, there's no doubt about it.\"\n\nIsrael will not just collapse, nor will its imperial backers just abandon such a useful watchdog in a crucial part of the world. And we know from South Africa that the appearance of emancipation can often be very different to the reality.\n\nBut the three pillars of liberation -- the courageous resistance by Palestinians themselves, the revolutionary uprisings of workers and the poor in the wider Middle East and the rage against imperialist states in the West -- can win.",

        "text": "New Delhi [India], February 23 (ANI): Bharat Serums and Vaccines (BSV), a biopharmaceutical company in India, has recently inked an exclusive distribution agreement with MediWound (NASDAQ: MDWD) to introduce NexoBrid, a groundbreaking treatment for severe burns, in the Indian market.\n\nAccording to Dr Sameek Bhattacharya, Head of Burn Unit, RML Hospital Delhi, \"In India, we have about 75 burn units and 26 skin banks to treat burn patients. There have been significant positive changes in the country regarding burn management. We have national programs for the prevention and control of burn injuries. There are different types of burns, including chemical, electrical, hot liquid, and burns from flame. However, all burns are the same as there is a layer of dead tissue on the skin that needs to be removed, so whatever the agent, it can be repaired through surgery or topical creams.\"\"Burn treatment also depends on skin thickness; in my experience, younger people are more vulnerable to burns as they have thinner skin than the older population. A recent study says about 78,00,000 people get burned annually, including minor burns. Furthermore, there are more than 10,00,000 hospitalisations yearly, and there is a need to reduce this number to improve patient outcomes,\" he further saidThere are three primary types of burns: first-, second-, and third-degree burns. Each degree of burn is based on the severity of damage to the skin, with first-degree being the most minor and third-degree being the most severe. Further, while some burns can be treated at home, severe ones (second and third-degree) require immediate medical attention.\n\nMost burns are treated by cleaning the area with soap and water, followed by dressings and topical creams. Nexobrid (concentrate of proteolytic enzymes enriched in bromelain) is a topically administered biological product that enzymatically removes nonviable burn tissue, or eschar, in patients with deep partial and full-thickness thermal burns within four hours of application without harming viable tissue.\n\nThe cream has demonstrated a significant reduction in time to achieve complete eschar removal and a substantial decrease in wound area requiring surgical excision (surgical need) while demonstrating non-inferiority to SOC in the quality of scars (dead tissues).\n\nProf Lior Rosenberg, also Founder and CMO at MediWound Ltd, Israel said, \"Nexobrid is a paradigm-shifting solution for treating burn victims as it only dissolves the dead tissue and does not impact the skin. It is an effective solution for treating burn victims, especially those who have suffered severe burns. In fact, this cream dissolves into the skin and does not impact the skin's dermis. Since the dermis can heal spontaneously, it is essential to maintain it so that the patient's recovery is faster.\"\"Every burn victim is keen to reduce the pain and scarring caused by the burn. While burns are traumatic, this cream can be an effective solution as it will reduce the scars and improve patient outcomes. More importantly, since this cream reduces the need for surgery, it automatically reduces blood loss and pain associated with surgery. All in all, this cream will effectively reduce scarring as well,\" Rosenberg added. (ANI)",

        "title": "Watch | Two years of Russia-Ukraine war: Has India's foreign policy changed at all?",
        "text": "We get you the picture that emerged at the Ministry of External Affairs' annual Raisina Dialogue\n\nAhead of the 2-year anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a barrage of European Foreign Ministers are in Delhi for the annual Raisina Dialogue. Is Ukraine in danger of losing land annexed by Russia permanently? And has the needle of Indian Foreign policy moved at all since 2022?\n\nWe get you the picture that emerged at the Ministry of External Affairs' annual Raisina Dialogue - where 15 of 21 Foreign Ministers gathered were from Europe - and made a strong pitch for India to support Ukraine and to reconsider oil and arms purchases from Russia.\n\nIn an interview to German paper Handelsblatt this week Mr. Jaishankar had defended India's position, saying \"Russia has never harmed India's interests\".\n\nTwo years into the Ukraine war - that originally was expected to have been much shorter- here are the 5 things you need to know\n\nTwo years after the Russia announced its special operations in Ukraine- If by March 2022 Russia had occupied about 20% of Ukrainian territory, by 2024 it still controls about 17% of it. By the end of the year, estimates say Russia will have spent $132 billion, and lost more than $300 bn due to financial sanctions by the west. But its sales of oil are nearly back to pre-war levels due to countries like China, India and Brazil.\n\nUkraine has borne the brunt of the war- tens of thousands dead, more than 14 million displaced, of which 6 million are now refugees living in 11 countries. Cities, infrastructure destroyed, and a constant pressure on its arms and military resources. According to the Ukrainian Dy FM- Ukraine has already suffered $500 bn in losses. It is now applying for membership to the European Union-NATO membership may more complicated\n\nThe 2 years of war have shown many faultlines in the west as different countries Debate over funding the war. The US, heading into an uncertain election is seeing pushback in Congress, European countries have seen a more unified voice, but many in Europe are not yet increasing their Defence budgets to the 2% required for Ukraine. One obvious outcome : Finland and Sweden have now joined NATO. There's also no question that Israel's bombardment of Gaza has brought new schisms, and also exposed some of the double speak of these countries on civilian deaths.\n\nA similar kind of contested unity in the Global South- that largely disapproves of Russia's actions, but doesn't agree with the unilateral sanctions imposed on Russia, or the narrative that holds only Russia responsible. At the G20 summit in India last year, the final joint statement did not criticize Russia for the war in any way. And despite western discomfort, 5 new members joined BRICS this year- incl UAE, KSA, Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia.\n\nIs there a UN or multilateral way forward? Russia has ruled out pulling its troops out of entrenched positions- however, at Ukraine's request, Switzerland is planning a peace Conference in the coming months, and has asked all countries including India to attend, with an eye on possible mediators\n\nSpeaking to a US journalist Tucker Carlson last week, here's what Russian president Putin had said: \"Why would we attack Poland? We have simply no interest in Poland, Latvia or any other countries- this is just threat-mongering.\"\n\nIndia's position\n\nRussia ties - no shift on abstentions at the UN. An increase in Oil procurement so Russia accounts from 30-40% of Oil imports as opposed to less than a percent pre-war. Military Hardware procurement has flagged- due to Russia capacity and payment issues, but bilateral trade is rising. On a political level, PM hasn't gone to Moscow for 2 years now but EAM Jaishankar did visit in December, and PM Modi is expected to go for the BRICS summit in Moscow in October. Meanwhile no response to the death of Opposition leader Alexei Navalny, despite the chorus of protest from the west.\n\nWith Ukraine, New Delhi has been more conservative- while it has provided about 100 tonnes of aid like medicines, water tanks, tents etc, it has not agreed to infrastructural aid Ukraine has requested. No visits by ministers to Kiev, PM Modi met Zelensky in Japan but didn't invite him to the G20 summit\n\nHowever, despite this stand, India's ties with the US and Europe have not been affected, while a few Indian companies have been sanctioned, there is no let up in bilateral engagement from the west, especially Europe- Raisina dialogue being a case in point. And this is seen as a major success for the government\n\nWorldview Take\n\nTwo years into the war in Ukraine, Russian annexation of parts of Ukraine that form a buffer zone on its western flank seem impossible to reverse, but so is the damage to its reputation. The US and Europe's double standards on the killing of civilians, bombardment of hospitals and schools in Ukraine vs Gaza has made its position unsellable to the rest of the world. In all of this, India's position has delivered its diplomacy a tactical if not a principled win. Pleasing all sides in a war is more difficult in the long run, however.",

        "text": "New Delhi [India], February 23 (ANI): Bharat Serums and Vaccines (BSV), a biopharmaceutical company in India, has recently inked an exclusive distribution agreement with MediWound (NASDAQ: MDWD) to introduce NexoBrid, a groundbreaking treatment for severe burns, in the Indian market.\n\nAccording to Dr Sameek Bhattacharya, Head of Burn Unit, RML Hospital Delhi, \"In India, we have about 75 burn units and 26 skin banks to treat burn patients. There have been significant positive changes in the country regarding burn management. We have national programs for the prevention and control of burn injuries. There are different types of burns, including chemical, electrical, hot liquid, and burns from flame. However, all burns are the same as there is a layer of dead tissue on the skin that needs to be removed, so whatever the agent, it can be repaired through surgery or topical creams.\"\"Burn treatment also depends on skin thickness; in my experience, younger people are more vulnerable to burns as they have thinner skin than the older population. A recent study says about 78,00,000 people get burned annually, including minor burns. Furthermore, there are more than 10,00,000 hospitalisations yearly, and there is a need to reduce this number to improve patient outcomes,\" he further saidThere are three primary types of burns: first-, second-, and third-degree burns. Each degree of burn is based on the severity of damage to the skin, with first-degree being the most minor and third-degree being the most severe. Further, while some burns can be treated at home, severe ones (second and third-degree) require immediate medical attention.\n\nMost burns are treated by cleaning the area with soap and water, followed by dressings and topical creams. Nexobrid (concentrate of proteolytic enzymes enriched in bromelain) is a topically administered biological product that enzymatically removes nonviable burn tissue, or eschar, in patients with deep partial and full-thickness thermal burns within four hours of application without harming viable tissue.\n\nThe cream has demonstrated a significant reduction in time to achieve complete eschar removal and a substantial decrease in wound area requiring surgical excision (surgical need) while demonstrating non-inferiority to SOC in the quality of scars (dead tissues).\n\nProf Lior Rosenberg, also Founder and CMO at MediWound Ltd, Israel said, \"Nexobrid is a paradigm-shifting solution for treating burn victims as it only dissolves the dead tissue and does not impact the skin. It is an effective solution for treating burn victims, especially those who have suffered severe burns. In fact, this cream dissolves into the skin and does not impact the skin's dermis. Since the dermis can heal spontaneously, it is essential to maintain it so that the patient's recovery is faster.\"\"Every burn victim is keen to reduce the pain and scarring caused by the burn. While burns are traumatic, this cream can be an effective solution as it will reduce the scars and improve patient outcomes. More importantly, since this cream reduces the need for surgery, it automatically reduces blood loss and pain associated with surgery. All in all, this cream will effectively reduce scarring as well,\" Rosenberg added. (ANI)",

        "text": "NEW DELHI\n\nIn the lexicon on warfare, \"greyzone\" is the latest entry, because of what has happened in the South China Sea and what has happened along our northern borders, Chief of Defence Staff Gen. Anil Chauhan said on Friday in a reference to China.\n\nGen. Chauhan said greyzone warfare is a kind of a military action below a particular threshold that would invite a response. In an oblique reference to China's actions, both along the Line of Actual Control as well as the South China Sea, Gen. Chauhan said in greyzone warfare the dividend of the action may be available only after a long time. \"To start this, possibly, you will have to have a dispute to be successful in launching this... The origin lies in a historical dispute,\" he remarked.\n\nOn similar lines, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Commander Adm. John Aquilino, speaking of the exceptional growth in India-U.S. relations said the ability to share information is \"like never before\" and some of that is based on actions that \"occurred on the Indian northern border\".\n\nThey were speaking at different sessions on the third day of the Raisina Dialogue jointly organised by the Ministry of External Affairs and the Observer Research Foundation.\n\nStressing on partnerships to preserve the global commons, Adm. Aqualino said U.S. cooperation with all its partners has expanded exponentially over the past three years. \"Some of them is based in the environment, the aggressive action of some nations are forcing other nations to come together to ensure we stand for what we believe in. The U.S.-India relationship has certainly grown exponentially,\" he said during a panel discussion 'From the Aegean Sea to the South China Sea: Responding to Maritime Sieges'.\n\n\"The capabilities that are co-produced here with India whether it be C-130s, helicopter pieces, munitions, now GE engines and carrier cooperation, those things have exploded in three years. Our ability to share information is like never before. Some of that's based on actions that occurred on the Indian northern border. The sharing of information to understand that my partner's forces are at risk, and we are there to help.\"\n\nExpanding linkages\n\nThis, he said, expands across the globe, whether it be through treaties or other linkages, including the Quad. \"Those partnerships have expanded. We do 120 exercises a year in the region,\" Adm. Aquilino said.\n\nEarlier this week, Defence Secretary Giridhar Aramane had acknowledged the possibility that India \"may encounter\" a similar situation as the 2020 stand-off with China, which he said is \"keeping us active all the time\", that \"we are standing against a bully in a very determined fashion.\" He further acknowledged the quick intelligence support from the U.S., and said the \"strong resolve that we support each other in the face of a common threat is going to be of critical importance to us.\"\n\nIndian Navy Chief Adm. R. Hari Kumar said in all recent conflicts, be it Israel-Hamas or the Ukraine war, the changing nature of warfare is evident and stressed on the need to adapt to the use of modern technologies, which are lately becoming more affordable and accessible.\n\nStressing on the importance of naval power, Adm. Kumar noted that if there is a large merchant fleet or trade, then there is need for a Navy. In this regard, he noted that today, India is the fifth largest economy and may be before 2030 we will be the third largest economy. \"What does it imply? It means we will be importing more, exporting more, doing value addition. And where does this go through? It will all go through the sea. More than 90% of the trade as such will go through the sea. And where we contribute in services for the tourist economy, over 45% of that actually goes through the Internet, through the undersea cables. So a great chunk of the economy will be completely dependent on the sea,\" he said.\n\nThere is risk at sea, of the need to maintain maritime security and it is going to become more and more challenging, he said adding, that more investment is needed to build assets in preparation. \"People say that budget is a challenge. I would say that even if it is under 2% of the GDP, as the GDP grows it is definitely adequate to prepare to meet the challenges,\" Adm. Kumar added.\n\nFrench Navy Chief Adm. Nicolas Vaujour said today most things are contested, notably, the global commons and the sovereignty of states are contested. \"All the pillars of the sovereignty of the states are contested -- it is financial, it is economic, it is everywhere.\"\n\nEchoing similar views, the First Sea Lord and Chief of the U.K. Navy Adm. Sir Ben Key said if people wanted to impose their will on global commons like the sea, the ripples would be felt far and wide. \"This is what differentiates the maritime environment from land, and why no navy can cover all of the world at the same time. The interdependencies of one effect are so intertwined that we're actually obligated to work together.\"",

        "text": "Israeli protesters demonstrate outside the Israeli army's headquarters in Tel Aviv, calling for a ceasefire in the war on Gaza, October 28, 2023. (Oren Ziv)\n\nIf the nations of the world-particularly the United States and the Arab countries-wanted to stop Israel's slaughter, torture and ethnic cleansing in Gaza, they could do so tomorrow with suspension of oil, arms and technology imports and exports to Israel. Though \"Free Palestine\" \"and Let Gaza Live\" protesters may shut down bridges, occupy train stations and march by the millions in cities across the globe, key governments-the US, UK, Germany, Canada, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and India- continue to keep commerce humming, monarchies in place and an empire standing even in the midst of what the World Court ruled was a plausible case of genocide. Members of the United Nations would do the world a favor if they followed the lead of South Africa at the International Court of Justice to condemn both in deed and action the crimes of Israel.\n\nIn a February press release, seven national unions and over two hundred local unions announced the formation of the National Labor Network for Ceasefire (NLNC) to \"end the death and devastation\" in the Middle East, and to build support for the ceasefire among unions around the country. According to the NLNC, Unions calling for a ceasefire represent over 9 million union members, more than half the labor movement in the United States. The seven national unions include: American Postal Workers Union (APWU), the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA), the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT), the National Education Association (NEA), National Nurses United (NNU), the United Auto Workers (UAW), and the United Electrical Workers (UE).\n\nWhether the NLNC will join CODEPINK, Teachers Against Genocide, Doctors Against Genocide and other organizations on Capitol Hill opposed to President Biden's request for a $95 billion war spending supplemental-$14 billion for weapons for Israel-seems unlikely-though not impossible-in an election year when the specter of another Trump union-busting presidency casts a fearful shadow. The AFL-CIO, representing 12.5 million workers, voted in January to endorse Biden's re-election.\n\n[Susan Sarandon with CODEPINK's Congressional Days of Actions for Palestine advocates/Feb. 15, 2024]\n\nItaly, Spain & Belgium Suspend Arms\n\nUntil recently Italy was responsible for five percent of Israeli weapons purchases-helicopters and naval artillery-over the last ten years. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani claims, however, that Italy stopped all weapons shipments to Israel following that nation's collective punishment of Gaza for October 7th.\n\nIn mid-February, a Dutch appeals court instructed the Netherlands to stop sending F-35 fighter jet components to Israel. \"The court finds that there is a clear risk that Israel's F-35 fighter jets might be used in the commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law,\" ruled the court in response to a lawsuit filed by Oxfam and other human rights groups.\n\nThe court ruled the Dutch government had seven days to halt the supply of fighter jets and eight weeks to appeal.\n\nUK Outrage\n\nHuman rights organizations, the Global Legal Action Network in the UK and Al-Haq, in Ramallah, have taken legal action against the UK to halt arms sales to Israel totaling over $600-million since 2015, with the UK sending F-35 fighter jets to Israel for its assault on Gaza.\n\nPalestinian rights activists, among them two Israeli dissidents Stavit Sinai and Ronnie Barkan were put on trial in the UK in January after the Bristol-area office of Elbit UK was sprayed with red paint, its windows sledgehammered. Elbit UK is a subsidiary of Elbit Systems, an Israeli-based company that manufactures 500 pound bombs, artillery shells and drones for Israel's genocide Gaza. Sinai, who lives in Germany but flew to England for the protest, said, \"Taking action outside of the country where the crimes are taking place... has been proven to be extremely efficient to exert pressure on the perpetrators.\"\n\nPushback in Canada\n\nIn an Open Letter (2/5/23) to M\u00e9lanie Joly, Canada's prime minister, over a dozen organizations, including the Anglican Church of Canada, Human Rights Watch and Oxfam Canada, demanded Canada halt its weapons and military hardware sales to Israel that have totaled more than $100 million during the past decade. Canada's foreign ministry insists it has not issued any permits for \"full weapon systems for major conventional arms or light weapons to Israel for over 30 years.\" Ceasefire advocates argue their government is not being transparent about the parts it supplies for missiles and bombs while continuing \"to approve arms exports since October 7 despite the clear risk of genocide in Gaza.\"\n\nU.S. as Biggest Arms Exporter to Israel\n\nChief among those governments that aid and abet Israeli genocide is the United States, which has has a history of raiding the treasury to subsidize its proxy in the oil and gas rich Middle East. According to the State Department, the US has handed Israel's military apparatus over $130-billion dollars since 1948, when Zionist terrorists destroyed over 500 villages, burning some to the ground, to establish a Jewish state on Palestinian land.\n\nThe State Department proudly asserts US subsidies have made the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), known to critics as Israel Occupation Forces (IOF), \"one of the world's most capable, effective militaries ...\"\n\nSince October 7th, the US has supplied Israel with 15,000 bombs, 57,000 artillery shells and one-hundred 2,000 pound bunker busters to penetrate deep underground tunnels beneath apartments, hospitals and refugee camps, turning densely populated neighborhoods into graveyards.\n\nWar Profiteers\n\nIn a report entitled, \"The Companies Profiting from Israel's 2023-2024 Attacks on Gaza,\" the American Friends Service Committee documents the role of US military contractors in aiding and abetting genocide in Gaza:\n\nRaytheon (RTX), headquartered in Waltham, MA, outfits the Israeli military with air-to-surface missiles for its F-16 fighter jets, as well as internationally-banned cluster bombs and bunker busters. Northrop Grumman, based in Falls Church, VA, furnishes Israel with Longbow missile delivery systems while Lockheed Martin, its main office in Bethesda, MD, supplies Israel with Hellfire missiles, F-16 and F-35 fighter jets, their engine parts maintained by Pratt & Whitney, a Farmington, CT company that in 2015 signed a 15-year contract with the Israeli military.\n\n\"Pratt & Whitney is humbled and honored by the confidence Israeli leadership has placed in us and we look forward to working with local industries to provide continued, long-term support to the Israeli warfighter,\" said Bennett Croswell, president, Pratt & Whitney Military Engines.\n\nA deeper dive into the weapons supply chain suggests China could play a decisive role in stopping the genocide by shutting down production of magnets used in Honeywell-supplied turbo machine pumps and circuit boards for the F-35 fighter jets bombing Gaza. In 2022, the Pentagon-upon realizing the F'35's parts were manufactured in China- placed deliveries of the parts on hold only to reverse itself two days later with a waiver for parts deemed too critical to block.\n\nWhat if ... ?\n\nWhat would happen if US military contractors acceded to the demands of anti-war protesters in Massachusetts, California and Arizona holding demonstrations and die-in's in front of Raytheon's offices? If Congress and the White House pulled the plug on the annual near $4 billion subsidy for the Israeli military? If universities followed through on student resolutions, such as the measure passed at the University of California at Davis, to divest from companies profiting off the Israeli occupation?\n\nSince the US provides Israel with roughly 15% of its military budget, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right coalition might have to rethink their campaign of Palestinian erasure or step up their shopping elsewhere, perhaps in Germany which has increased its weapons exports to Israel tenfold since October 7th, with permit approvals close to $323 million, according to Reuters.\n\nArab complicity with Israeli genocide\n\nIn June, 2023, a few months before the Hamas raid, on the eve of a normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia, Israel's Defense Ministry reported the country had in 2022 exported over $12 billion in military products-drones, missile, rockets, air defense systems- with almost a quarter of the sales to Arab countries party to the Abraham Accords, bilateral normalization agreements. The Israel Defense Ministry would not identify its arms clients, but signatories and supporters of the Abraham Accords include the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.\n\nMint Press' Minar Adley reports Morocco is building a military intelligence base for Israel in Afso on the border with Algeria, a country that has resoundingly condemned Israel's genocide and pushed the UN Security Council to support a ceasefire. In \"Why Morocco will not cut ties with Israel,\" the Atlantic Council's Sarah Zaaimi argues that despite massive street heat and a Moroccan consulate in Gaza, the government of Morocco will not break with Israel because the relationship is \"a matter of national security for a monarchy that's succeeded in surviving for twelve centuries.\" Elbit Systems, Israel's largest weapons manufacturer, plans to construct two weapons factories in Morocco, while Elbit Systems has established Elbit System Emirates in the UAE to promote \"long term cooperation\" with the Israeli military.\n\nCNN reports that in January the US-under the radar, without fanfare or press -- sealed a deal with Qatar to continue operating for another ten years the US' largest military base in the Middle East. The base that can house up to 10,000 troops Is a \"pivotal hub for the US Central Command's air operations in or around Afghanistan, Iran and across the Middle East.\" Next door, at US naval headquarters in Bahrain, the US Fifth Fleet- stationed in the Red Sea with 7,000 US sailors-takes its cue from a command center.\n\nLet's not overlook India ...\n\nIndia tops the list as the largest importer of weapons from Israel, accounting for over 40% of Israel's exports, but the relationship is not limited to imports from israel. According to Middle East Eye, India co-produces weapons with Israel while coordinating joint military drills. For Indian leader Nadrendra Modi, a right-wing nationalist bent on violent subjugation of India's 20 percent Muslim population, Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu's brutal treatment of the Palestinians raises few concerns. In fact, Israel's 75-year history of Palestinian erasure serves as a model for Indian nationalists spewing hateful rhetoric, forming lynch mobs and looting and torching Muslim homes.\n\nAl Jazeera reports an estimated 130 countries, including Colombia, have purchased drones and spying technology from Israel, though Israel suspended weapons shipments to Latin America after Colombia's left-leaning President Gustavo Petro, a former Marxist revolutionary, declined to condemn the Hamas October 7th attacks, later comparing Israel's destruction in Gaza to the heinous actions of Nazi Germany.\n\nFirst the good news (well sort of ...)\n\nYemen's Houthis launched a solidarity blockade of Red Sea shipments to Israel resulting in an 85% drop in activity at Israel's port of Eilat. Unfortunately, the Answar Allah's demands for a ceasefire and commitment to uphold the UN Convention on Genocide has resulted in US bombings of the impoverished nation's capital Saana, one of the oldest cities in the Middle East.\n\n[CODEPINK and allies disrupt House Hearing on Houthis - Hands Off Yemen/Feb. 14, 2024]\n\nOil: From Azerbaijan through Turkey to Israel\n\nDespite Turkish President Erdoigan's tough anti-Israel rhetoric, Turkey remains a principal oil supplier to Israel with miles of pipelines that deliver oil from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, suppliers of anywhere from 40- 60% of Israel's oil, through Turkey's port of Ceyhan in the Eastern Mediterranean. Earlier, on October 21st, the tanker Seaviolet reportedly carried one million barrels of oil from Muslim Azerbaijan to Israel's port of Eilat on the Red Sea, though since then Yemen's Houthis have blockaded Red Sea shipments to israel.\n\nSo how is oil reaching Israel now?\n\nBritish Petroleum, which has drilled for oil in Azerbaijan for three decades, is cumventing the Red Sea blockade to ship crude oil via the Horn of Good Hope in Africa, but there's a more efficient solution for those intent on undermining the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide.\n\n\"Zionist Land Bridge\"\n\nMint Press News cites Israel's Hebrew Television Station Channel 13 reports that Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE are together undermining the Houthis' efforts to block the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the passageway to the Suez Canal for a quarter of global trade, including oil to Israel. Rather than reroute ships through the treacherous waters of Africa's Cape of Good Hope -adding a month and a million dollars in fuel to the journey-the four Arab countries have established land corridors, with goods first unloaded at the ports of Dubai and Bahrain, then transported overland on highways from the UAE to Saudi Arabia, then onto Jordan until the cargo reaches Israel via the 115-mile long Jordan Highway overlooking the Dead Sea.\n\nWhile Israel imports almost all of its oil, it also exports crude to Bulgaria, India, Italy, Palestine and Australia, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (EOC), a data visualization tool developed at the MIT Media Lab.\n\nA Gas Grab\n\nFor months there's been speculation that Israel viewed October 7th as an opportunity to ethnically cleanse Gaza in order to exploit the coastal area's natural gas resources. To grab the goods, however, Israel would first have to remove the Palestinians who might claim title. In keeping with a plan hatched by the euphemistically named Defense Ministry, Israel told a million Palestinians to go south to Rafah for safety, only to bomb residential buildings while ramping up for a ground invasion of the city that straddles Egypt. Palestinian-rights advocates say this \"go south\" edict is to push Gazans further south into the scorching Sinai desert, into Egypt's lap, into tent cities, into an exile reminiscent of the first Nakba in 1948 when Israel drove 750,000 Palestinians from their land to bar them from ever returning.\n\nThe pieces of the puzzle come together.\n\nIn February Israel approved gas exploration licenses to six Israel and international companies for natural gas exploration in Palestine maritime areas off the coast of Gaza. Several organizations-Al Mezan Center for Human Rights and the Palestinian Center for Human Rights-warn Israel it had better cancel those contracts or face the consequences for violating international law. In a world, however, where Israel repeatedly violates international law-including orders from the World Court to stop killing Palestinians and provide massive humanitarian aid -- it's unlikely those contracts will be canceled any time soon unless there is a tsunami of civil unrest or a collective uproar in the 193-member UN General Assembly. Under the Uniting for Peace resolution the General Assembly could with a 2/3rd's vote (129 members) exert enormous pressure by sanctioning Israel and suspending it from UN activities.\n\nFirst the good news ...\n\nInternal dissent rocks Google in the United States, where employees waving Palestinian flags shut down Market Street (12/14/23) in San Francisco to protest Google's Project Nimbus, a 1.2 billion contract with the Israeli military for cloud computing engineered by Google and Amazon. Months earlier, before October 7th, hundreds of Amazon and Google tech workers protested the contract in four cities across the country with signs reading, \"No Tech for Apartheid.\" In an open letter, anonymous employees in 2021 charged the Nimbus contract greenlights \"unlawful data collection on Palestinians, and facilitates expansion of Israel's illegal settlements on Palestinian land.\"\n\nMultinational corporations like Microsoft, Google, IBM and Intel all have offices in Israel. Google's 8,000 square mile campus in Tel Aviv occupies eight floors of Electra Tower, with one floor reserved for Google's \"Campus Tel Aviv,\" a hub for entrepreneurs and start up companies. Hewlett-Packard-a target of the global BDS movement- profits off the Israeli occupation with biometric identification-hand and facial recognition-used at checkpoints throughout the West Bank, where excruciating wait times can take Palestinians all day to reach family in a village 30 miles away.\n\nA boycott of Israel's technology-computers, electronics, cybersecurity software-could send Israel's economy into an inflationary spiral, for high tech contributes 18% of the gross domestic product, employs over 12% of the workforce, accounts for half the country's exports and contributes 30% of the tax base, according to CNN.\n\nIsrael's surveillance technology includes Pegasus spyware that can invade your cell phone, capture text messages and collect passwords, border drones that monitor the movement of migrants across the Mediterranean, thermal cameras that can see through walls during police raids and facial recognition software for cameras at checkpoints and borders.\n\nOne of Israel's biggest trading partners is the European Union, which in 2018 purchased Elbit Systems drones to track and collect intelligence on asylum seekers. Critics charge the use of these drones without offering rescue operations for refugees risking their lives violates the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has long wanted the contracts canceled. Professor Richard Falk, Chair of Euro-Med's Board of Trustees, said the purchase is outrageous considering the \"repressive and unlawful ways\" drones are used to oppress Palestinians in the occupied territories.\n\nIn the UAE, where dissent is outlawed and labor unions forbidden, those who might protest their country's cozy relationship with Israel risk prison and torture, so it's not surprising that the royal family easily welcomed an Israeli tech hub to Abu Dhabi in 2022 and announced plans for a UAE technology institute in Haifa come 2024. \"We will work on some of the most interesting challenges in AI and at the same time contribute to the vision of scientific collaboration articulated in the Abraham Accords,\" writes Yoelle Maarek, the soo-to-be director of the center, who previously worked as an executive at Google, IBM, Amazon, and Yahoo.\n\nAnother top shopper for Israeli tech is India, which, according to the New York Times, bought Pegasus Spyware in 2017 to keep tabs on opponents of Modi's ultra-nationalist regime.\n\nAnd it's no secret that Saudi Arabia is one of Israel's best customers for Israeli tech used to hack the phones and spy on people deemed enemies of the state. Though the planned normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel is off the table for now, Saudi Arabia's 620-billion Public Investment Fund (PIF) continues to invest in Israeli tech start-ups.\n\nComing attractions on the tech market ...\n\nThe Israeli military says it's relying on an artificial intelligence-based system called Habsora (the Gospel) to \"produce targets at a fast pace\" in Gaza, where to date Israel has killed over 28,000 and wounded over 68,000 people. Richard Moyes, a researcher for Article 36, a team of policy experts based in the UK, discounts the accuracy of AI algorithms, telling The Guardian, \"We're seeing the widespread flattening of an urban area with heavy explosive weapons, so to claim there's precision and narrowness of force being exerted is not borne out by the facts.\"\n\n[NYC Delegation Rally Outside U.S. Permanent Mission to the UN/Jan. 31, 2024]\n\nIf nations anywhere in the supply chain are serious about ending genocide in Gaza and preventing a wider war, they can invoke the S in BDS and sanction Israel, prohibiting imports and exports of oil, weapons and technology. If the US, Canada, UK, Germany, India and the Arab countries complicit in Israel's slaughter refuse to reverse course-if they insist on aiding and abetting genocide in the face of the International Court of Justice's condemnation and global outrage over Israel's slaughter, then it's time for other countries to expose Israel and its abetters in a criminal tribunal on the floor of the United Nations to put the criminals, from Biden to Netanyahu, on trial for genocide.\n\nUntil that time, CODEPINK joins the global call to the UN General Assembly to sanction Israel as it brazenly violates International Court of Justice orders to stop killing and wounding Palestinians and start providing massive humanitarian aid. Our New York City delegation, together with other CODEPINK teams visiting embassies and consulates has encouraged countries to file declarations in support of South Africa's case at the ICJ.\n\nThe delegations deliver a strategic message in their visits to the UN missions: \"NO MORE WEAPONS, OIL OR TECH FOR ISRAEL.\"\n\nIt may be cliche to say, \"If there's a will, there's a way,\" but the truth is the collective power of the world-or even a sliver of the world-could stop the slaughter tomorrow.",

        "text": "New Delhi [India], February 23 (ANI): Bharat Serums and Vaccines (BSV), a biopharmaceutical company in India, has recently inked an exclusive distribution agreement with MediWound (NASDAQ: MDWD) to introduce NexoBrid, a groundbreaking treatment for severe burns, in the Indian market.\n\nAccording to Dr Sameek Bhattacharya, Head of Burn Unit, RML Hospital Delhi, \"In India, we have about 75 burn units and 26 skin banks to treat burn patients. There have been significant positive changes in the country regarding burn management. We have national programs for the prevention and control of burn injuries. There are different types of burns, including chemical, electrical, hot liquid, and burns from flame. However, all burns are the same as there is a layer of dead tissue on the skin that needs to be removed, so whatever the agent, it can be repaired through surgery or topical creams.\"\"Burn treatment also depends on skin thickness; in my experience, younger people are more vulnerable to burns as they have thinner skin than the older population. A recent study says about 78,00,000 people get burned annually, including minor burns. Furthermore, there are more than 10,00,000 hospitalisations yearly, and there is a need to reduce this number to improve patient outcomes,\" he further saidThere are three primary types of burns: first-, second-, and third-degree burns. Each degree of burn is based on the severity of damage to the skin, with first-degree being the most minor and third-degree being the most severe. Further, while some burns can be treated at home, severe ones (second and third-degree) require immediate medical attention.\n\nMost burns are treated by cleaning the area with soap and water, followed by dressings and topical creams. Nexobrid (concentrate of proteolytic enzymes enriched in bromelain) is a topically administered biological product that enzymatically removes nonviable burn tissue, or eschar, in patients with deep partial and full-thickness thermal burns within four hours of application without harming viable tissue.\n\nThe cream has demonstrated a significant reduction in time to achieve complete eschar removal and a substantial decrease in wound area requiring surgical excision (surgical need) while demonstrating non-inferiority to SOC in the quality of scars (dead tissues).\n\nProf Lior Rosenberg, also Founder and CMO at MediWound Ltd, Israel said, \"Nexobrid is a paradigm-shifting solution for treating burn victims as it only dissolves the dead tissue and does not impact the skin. It is an effective solution for treating burn victims, especially those who have suffered severe burns. In fact, this cream dissolves into the skin and does not impact the skin's dermis. Since the dermis can heal spontaneously, it is essential to maintain it so that the patient's recovery is faster.\"\"Every burn victim is keen to reduce the pain and scarring caused by the burn. While burns are traumatic, this cream can be an effective solution as it will reduce the scars and improve patient outcomes. More importantly, since this cream reduces the need for surgery, it automatically reduces blood loss and pain associated with surgery. All in all, this cream will effectively reduce scarring as well,\" Rosenberg added. (ANI)",

        "title": "The opposition alliance that aimed to oust Modi appears to be cracking just before India's elections",
        "text": "Last year more than two dozen opposition parties in India came together to take on Narendra Modi, one of the country's most popular prime ministers in generations. But the broad alliance, beset with ideological differences and personality clashes, is cracking at a crucial time, just months before the country votes in a national election.\n\nRiven by rivalries, political defections and ideological clashes, the INDIA alliance, formed to unseat Modi and defeat his Bharatiya Janata Party's electoral juggernaut, is in shambles, analysts say.\n\nMeanwhile, support for Modi is on the rise after he opened a Hindu temple in northern Ayodhya city last month, fulfilling his party's long-held Hindu nationalist pledge.\n\nLed by the Indian National Congress party that once dominated the country's politics, the unity front includes over two dozen powerful regional parties that are direct rivals to each other in some states. Their differences have only grown sharper as the election approaches, bolstering Modi's shot at securing a third consecutive term.\n\n\"The opposition is in disarray. They're looking very weak and not at all cohesive,\" said Arati Jerath, a political commentator.\n\nAnalysts say talks on seat-sharing within the alliance have gone cold, in part due to the Congress party's demands of fielding its own candidates in a majority of the seats, even in states where it is weak. This triggered two of the alliance's key partners in West Bengal and Punjab states to say they would contest seats there alone.\n\nIndia has a first-past-the-post multiparty electoral system in which the candidate who receives the most votes wins. In 2019, Modi's party received 37% of the votes, but won 303 of the 543 seats.\n\nThe opposition is hoping to consolidate the splintered vote among the parties by fielding a single primary candidate in each constituency against the BJP in the elections, which are expected to take place in April and May.\n\nMeanwhile the recent defection of Nitish Kumar, the chief minister of eastern Bihar state and one of the architects of the INDIA alliance, to Modi's party dealt another unexpected blow.\n\n\"Modi's party has been successful in exposing distrust within the opposition alliance. It is cannibalizing the opposition parties from within by engineering these defections and draining them from the ground,\" said Gilles Verniers, a scholar of Indian politics and a senior fellow at the New Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research.\n\nVerniers said the opposition has failed to find common ground and craft a narrative that could challenge Modi.\n\n\"From the start, the opposition alliance had to be more than just electoral arithmetic. But most parties are putting their own interests ahead and are looking to consolidate their positions in the states where they are strong. They are not ceding space to each other,\" he said.\n\nThe fracturing of the opposition alliance also stems from problems that have long plagued the dynastic Congress party, which is struggling to stay relevant among voters. In the 2019 election, the party secured a paltry 52 seats in Parliament.\n\nIn contrast, Modi has presented himself as an outsider cracking down on the political elite. The 73-year-old leader has also increasingly mixed religion with politics in a formula that has resonated deeply with India's majority Hindu population even if it undermines the country's secular roots.\n\nWhile the Congress' main leader, Rahul Gandhi - scion of the influential Gandhi family - has drawn large crowds along two cross-India walks in recent months, poll experts question whether it would actually translate into votes.\n\nThe Congress party also recently lost in key state polls where it fought directly against the BJP. Meanwhile, an emboldened Modi told Parliament earlier this month that his BJP was aiming for 370 seats in the upcoming polls, and their National Democratic Alliance would target 400 out of the 543 seats.\n\nThe opposition acknowledges there have been setbacks but claim they also been unfairly targeted and in a manner that belies the country's democratic principles.\n\nShashi Tharoor, a lawmaker from the Congress party, pointed to a spree of raids, arrests and corruption investigations against alliance leaders in some states by federal agencies that the opposition says are politically motivated.\n\nIndia's main financial investigation agency has launched probes against many key opposition leaders, all of whom are political opponents of the BJP. Meanwhile, some investigations against erstwhile opposition leaders who later switched their allegiance to the ruling party have been dropped.\n\n\"The government is not a believer in a level playing field,\" said Tharoor. \"There is not a single investigation, known or continuing, against anyone in the ruling party.\"\n\nModi's party denies using law enforcement agencies to target the opposition and says the agencies act independently.\n\nAccording to Tharoor, the harassment of the opposition fits into a larger, more troubling picture for India in which its democratic and secular foundations are under threat.\n\n\"The BJP has embarked on a very serious and far-reaching project to change the very character of the Indian nation,\" he said.\n\nPolitical experts question why the opposition has failed to make key issues, including rising unemployment and economic discontentment, resonate with the more than 900 million voters.\n\nEven as India's economy expands, joblessness among its large and young workforce has posed a significant challenge for Modi's government. This was on stark display last month, when thousands of Indians vied for construction jobs in war-hit Israel.\n\n\"They seem to lack the fire, the will to win, which the BJP have in ample quantities,\" said Jerath, the political commentator. \"Today, unless there is a popular uprising against the ruling party over economic distress, Modi looks well set to win a third term comfortably.\"",

        "text": "Palestines Ambassador to India Adnan Abu Al-Haija on Friday said the international community has ignored what has been going on against his people, and claimed that the main aim of Israel in the ongoing conflict in Gaza is to clear the region of Palestinians.At a discussion on the recent ruling of the International Court of Justice on the conflict, the ambassador said the international community should move quickly to find a political solution to the conflict.At the event, some opposition leaders and activists expressed solidarity with Palestine and called for an immediate ceasefire.\n\nPalestine's Ambassador to India Adnan Abu Al-Haija on Friday said the international community has ''ignored'' what has been going on against his people, and claimed that the main aim of Israel in the ongoing conflict in Gaza is to clear the region of Palestinians.\n\nAt a discussion on the recent ruling of the International Court of Justice on the conflict, the ambassador said the international community should move quickly to find a political solution to the conflict.\n\nAt the event, some opposition leaders and activists expressed solidarity with Palestine and called for an immediate ceasefire. They also accused the Indian government of not taking a stand on the issue.\n\nExpressing solidarity with Palestine, Congress leader Salman Khurshid said, ''We feel the pain of all Palestinian children and women and people. We also know that is a fate that may well await somebody else. It can happen here amongst us tomorrow. It could be anywhere else in the world. And how do we stop it? We must stop it when it is still in the bud.'' ''Our democratic government has to respond,'' he said, adding that India has long been tied to the cause of Palestine.\n\nIn his address, the ambassador said, ''The international community has ignored what has been going on against Palestinians. Palestinians have been suffering since 1917 when the British entered the country.'' He said the present Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the most ''extreme'' in the history of Israel, and 2.3 million people in Palestine have been living in an open prison for 17 years now.\n\n''What's the target of this aggression? It is to evacuate people from Palestine. This is the main target of the Israeli government. Because of that they have destroyed more than 80 per cent of Gaza strip buildings,'' he said.\n\n''No one can describe the situation in words. They have killed about 30,000 people. The UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) has also been attacked. More than a million and half are facing real hunger, but our decision is to live and die on the land of Palestine,'' he said. ''The international community should move quickly, if they don't find a political solution and establish a nation of Palestine, then future wars will be much worse than this war,'' he said. The International Court of Justice, in a genocide case brought by South Africa, demanded that Israel try to contain death and damage in its military offensive in Gaza.\n\nTalking about the ruling, senior advocate Anand Grover said the ICJ in a way said that ''genocide is being committed'' by Israel on the people of Palestine.\n\nHe said that by continuing the attack, Israel is violating the ruling, and added that India needs to break its silence.\n\nCommunist Party of India (Marxist) leader Subhashini Ali called Israel's attack an ''imperialist war''. ''Israel is an outpost of imperialism planted in the heart of the Arab world. Some people think it is a religious conflict, but that is not true,'' she said.\n\nShe also said that the funding for UNRWA should not be cut.\n\n''Israel says everyone we are killing is Hamas.... Two-thirds of the casualties are women and children,'' she said. CPI(ML) Liberation general secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya said that India today stands among the countries which are internationally being seen as ''complicit'' in what is happening in Gaza. ''Most countries are witnessing protests, we are not being permitted to carry out a protest in Delhi,'' he alleged.\n\n''Our foreign policy has changed and the most striking point is our growing strategic partnership with Israel...,'' he said.\n\nHe also drew parallels with the ongoing farmers' protest, and said, ''The way farmers are being suppressed that's also an Israel model... Zionism is the same as Hindutva,'' he said.\n\nIsrael declared war on Hamas on October 7, after the militants stormed into southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 250 hostages. More than 100 hostages were freed in a week-long ceasefire in late November.\n\nSince the start of the war, 29,514 Palestinians were killed in Israel's offensive and close to 70,000 were wounded, the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Friday.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "How Nations Could End Israeli Genocide: Stop the Weapons; Stop the Oil; Stop the Tech",
        "text": "If the nations of the world-particularly the United States and the Arab countries-wanted to stop Israel's slaughter, torture and ethnic cleansing in Gaza, they could do so tomorrow with suspension of oil, arms and technology imports and exports to Israel. Though \"Free Palestine\" \"and Let Gaza Live\" protesters may shut down bridges, occupy train stations and march by the millions in cities across the globe, key governments-the US, UK, Germany, Canada, Turkey, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and India- continue to keep commerce humming, monarchies in place and an empire standing even in the midst of what the World Court ruled was a plausible case of genocide. Members of the United Nations would do the world a favor if they followed the lead of South Africa at the International Court of Justice to condemn both in deed and action the crimes of Israel.\n\nIn a February press release, seven national unions and over two hundred local unions announced the formation of the National Labor Network for Ceasefire (NLNC) to \"end the death and devastation\" in the Middle East, and to build support for the ceasefire among unions around the country. According to the NLNC, Unions calling for a ceasefire represent over 9 million union members, more than half the labor movement in the United States. The seven national unions include: American Postal Workers Union (APWU), the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA), the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades (IUPAT), the National Education Association (NEA), National Nurses United (NNU), the United Auto Workers (UAW), and the United Electrical Workers (UE).\n\nWhether the NLNC will join CODEPINK, Teachers Against Genocide, Doctors Against Genocide and other organizations on Capitol Hill opposed to President Biden's request for a $95 billion war spending supplemental-$14 billion for weapons for Israel-seems unlikely-though not impossible-in an election year when the specter of another Trump union-busting presidency casts a fearful shadow. The AFL-CIO, representing 12.5 million workers, voted in January to endorse Biden's re-election.\n\nUntil recently Italy was responsible for five percent of Israeli weapons purchases-helicopters and naval artillery-over the last ten years. Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani claims, however, that Italy stopped all weapons shipments to Israel following that nation's collective punishment of Gaza for October 7th.\n\nIn mid-February, a Dutch appeals court instructed the Netherlands to stop sending F-35 fighter jet components to Israel. \"The court finds that there is a clear risk that Israel's F-35 fighter jets might be used in the commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law,\" ruled the court in response to a lawsuit filed by Oxfam and other human rights groups.\n\nThe court ruled the Dutch government had seven days to halt the supply of fighter jets and eight weeks to appeal.\n\nUK Outrage\n\nHuman rights organizations, the Global Legal Action Network in the UK and Al-Haq, in Ramallah, have taken legal action against the UK to halt arms sales to Israel totaling over $600-million since 2015, with the UK sending F-35 fighter jets to Israel for its assault on Gaza.\n\nPalestinian rights activists, among them two Israeli dissidents Stavit Sinai and Ronnie Barkan were put on trial in the UK in January after the Bristol-area office of Elbit UK was sprayed with red paint, its windows sledgehammered. Elbit UK is a subsidiary of Elbit Systems, an Israeli-based company that manufactures 500 pound bombs, artillery shells and drones for Israel's genocide Gaza. Sinai, who lives in Germany but flew to England for the protest, said, \"Taking action outside of the country where the crimes are taking place... has been proven to be extremely efficient to exert pressure on the perpetrators.\"\n\nPushback in Canada\n\nIn an Open Letter (2/5/23) to M\u00e9lanie Joly, Canada's prime minister, over a dozen organizations, including the Anglican Church of Canada, Human Rights Watch and Oxfam Canada, demanded Canada halt its weapons and military hardware sales to Israel that have totaled more than $100 million during the past decade. Canada's foreign ministry insists it has not issued any permits for \"full weapon systems for major conventional arms or light weapons to Israel for over 30 years.\" Ceasefire advocates argue their government is not being transparent about the parts it supplies for missiles and bombs while continuing \"to approve arms exports since October 7 despite the clear risk of genocide in Gaza.\"\n\nU.S. as Biggest Arms Exporter to Israel\n\nChief among those governments that aid and abet Israeli genocide is the United States, which has has a history of raiding the treasury to subsidize its proxy in the oil and gas rich Middle East. According to the State Department, the US has handed Israel's military apparatus over $130-billion dollars since 1948, when Zionist terrorists destroyed over 500 villages, burning some to the ground, to establish a Jewish state on Palestinian land.\n\nThe State Department proudly asserts US subsidies have made the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), known to critics as Israel Occupation Forces (IOF), \"one of the world's most capable, effective militaries ...\"\n\nSince October 7th, the US has supplied Israel with 15,000 bombs, 57,000 artillery shells and one-hundred 2,000 pound bunker busters to penetrate deep underground tunnels beneath apartments, hospitals and refugee camps, turning densely populated neighborhoods into graveyards.\n\nWar Profiteers\n\nIn a report entitled, \"The Companies Profiting from Israel's 2023-2024 Attacks on Gaza,\" the American Friends Service Committee documents the role of US military contractors in aiding and abetting genocide in Gaza:\n\nRaytheon (RTX), headquartered in Waltham, MA, outfits the Israeli military with air-to-surface missiles for its F-16 fighter jets, as well as internationally-banned cluster bombs and bunker busters. Northrop Grumman, based in Falls Church, VA, furnishes Israel with Longbow missile delivery systems while Lockheed Martin, its main office in Bethesda, MD, supplies Israel with Hellfire missiles, F-16 and F-35 fighter jets, their engine parts maintained by Pratt & Whitney, a Farmington, CT company that in 2015 signed a 15-year contract with the Israeli military.\n\n\"Pratt & Whitney is humbled and honored by the confidence Israeli leadership has placed in us and we look forward to working with local industries to provide continued, long-term support to the Israeli warfighter,\" said Bennett Croswell, president, Pratt & Whitney Military Engines.\n\nChina as producer of F-35 parts for the US\n\nA deeper dive into the weapons supply chain suggests China could play a decisive role in stopping the genocide by shutting down production of magnets used in Honeywell-supplied turbo machine pumps and circuit boards for the F-35 fighter jets bombing Gaza. In 2022, the Pentagon-upon realizing the F'35's parts were manufactured in China- placed deliveries of the parts on hold only to reverse itself two days later with a waiver for parts deemed too critical to block.\n\nWhat if ... ?\n\nWhat would happen if US military contractors acceded to the demands of anti-war protesters in Massachusetts, California and Arizona holding demonstrations and die-in's in front of Raytheon's offices? If Congress and the White House pulled the plug on the annual near $4 billion subsidy for the Israeli military? If universities followed through on student resolutions, such as the measure passed at the University of California at Davis, to divest from companies profiting off the Israeli occupation?\n\nSince the US provides Israel with roughly 15% of its military budget, Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right coalition might have to rethink their campaign of Palestinian erasure or step up their shopping elsewhere, perhaps in Germany which has increased its weapons exports to Israel tenfold since October 7th, with permit approvals close to $323 million, according to Reuters.\n\nArab complicity with Israeli genocide\n\nIn June, 2023, a few months before the Hamas raid, on the eve of a normalization agreement with Saudi Arabia, Israel's Defense Ministry reported the country had in 2022 exported over $12 billion in military products-drones, missile, rockets, air defense systems- with almost a quarter of the sales to Arab countries party to the Abraham Accords, bilateral normalization agreements. The Israel Defense Ministry would not identify its arms clients, but signatories and supporters of the Abraham Accords include the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.\n\nMint Press' Minar Adley reports Morocco is building a military intelligence base for Israel in Afso on the border with Algeria, a country that has resoundingly condemned Israel's genocide and pushed the UN Security Council to support a ceasefire. In \"Why Morocco will not cut ties with Israel,\" the Atlantic Council's Sarah Zaaimi argues that despite massive street heat and a Moroccan consulate in Gaza, the government of Morocco will not break with Israel because the relationship is \"a matter of national security for a monarchy that's succeeded in surviving for twelve centuries.\" Elbit Systems, Israel's largest weapons manufacturer, plans to construct two weapons factories in Morocco, while Elbit Systems has established Elbit System Emirates in the UAE to promote \"long term cooperation\" with the Israeli military.\n\nCNN reports that in January the US-under the radar, without fanfare or press -- sealed a deal with Qatar to continue operating for another ten years the US' largest military base in the Middle East. The base that can house up to 10,000 troops Is a \"pivotal hub for the US Central Command's air operations in or around Afghanistan, Iran and across the Middle East.\" Next door, at US naval headquarters in Bahrain, the US Fifth Fleet- stationed in the Red Sea with 7,000 US sailors-takes its cue from a command center.\n\nLet's not overlook India ...\n\nIndia tops the list as the largest importer of weapons from Israel, accounting for over 40% of Israel's exports, but the relationship is not limited to imports from israel. According to Middle East Eye, India co-produces weapons with Israel while coordinating joint military drills. For Indian leader Nadrendra Modi, a right-wing nationalist bent on violent subjugation of India's 20 percent Muslim population, Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin Netanyahu's brutal treatment of the Palestinians raises few concerns. In fact, Israel's 75-year history of Palestinian erasure serves as a model for Indian nationalists spewing hateful rhetoric, forming lynch mobs and looting and torching Muslim homes.\n\nAlJazeera reports an estimated 130 countries, including Colombia, have purchased drones and spying technology from Israel, though Israel suspended weapons shipments to Latin America after Colombia's left-leaning President Gustavo Petro, a former Marxist revolutionary, declined to condemn the Hamas October 7th attacks, later comparing Israel's destruction in Gaza to the heinous actions of Nazi Germany.\n\nYemen's Houthis launched a solidarity blockade of Red Sea shipments to Israel resulting in an 85% drop in activity at Israel's port of Eilat. Unfortunately, the Answar Allah's demands for a ceasefire and commitment to uphold the UN Convention on Genocide has resulted in US bombings of the impoverished nation's capital Saana, one of the oldest cities in the Middle East.\n\nOil: From Azerbaijan through Turkey to Israel\n\nDespite Turkish President Erdoigan's tough anti-Israel rhetoric, Turkey remains a principal oil supplier to Israel with miles of pipelines that deliver oil from Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, suppliers of anywhere from 40- 60% of Israel's oil, through Turkey's port of Ceyhan in the Eastern Mediterranean. Earlier, on October 21st, the tanker Seaviolet reportedly carried one million barrels of oil from Muslim Azerbaijan to Israel's port of Eilat on the Red Sea, though since then Yemen's Houthis have blockaded Red Sea shipments to israel.\n\nSo how is oil reaching Israel now?\n\nBritish Petroleum, which has drilled for oil in Azerbaijan for three decades, is cumventing the Red Sea blockade to ship crude oil via the Horn of Good Hope in Africa, but there's a more efficient solution for those intent on undermining the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide.\n\n\"Zionist Land Bridge\"\n\nMint Press News cites Israel's Hebrew Television Station Channel 13 reports that Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the UAE are together undermining the Houthis' efforts to block the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the passageway to the Suez Canal for a quarter of global trade, including oil to Israel. Rather than reroute ships through the treacherous waters of Africa's Cape of Good Hope -adding a month and a million dollars in fuel to the journey-the four Arab countries have established land corridors, with goods first unloaded at the ports of Dubai and Bahrain, then transported overland on highways from the UAE to Saudi Arabia, then onto Jordan until the cargo reaches Israel via the 115-mile long Jordan Highway overlooking the Dead Sea.\n\nWhile Israel imports almost all of its oil, it also exports crude to Bulgaria, India, Italy, Palestine and Australia, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity (EOC), a data visualization tool developed at the MIT Media Lab.\n\nA Gas Grab\n\nFor months there's been speculation that Israel viewed October 7th as an opportunity to ethnically cleanse Gaza in order to exploit the coastal area's natural gas resources. To grab the goods, however, Israel would first have to remove the Palestinians who might claim title. In keeping with a plan hatched by the euphemistically named Defense Ministry, Israel told a million Palestinians to go south to Rafah for safety, only to bomb residential buildings while ramping up for a ground invasion of the city that straddles Egypt. Palestinian-rights advocates say this \"go south\" edict is to push Gazans further south into the scorching Sinai desert, into Egypt's lap, into tent cities, into an exile reminiscent of the first Nakba in 1948 when Israel drove 750,000 Palestinians from their land to bar them from ever returning.\n\nThe pieces of the puzzle come together.\n\nIn February Israel approved gas exploration licenses to six Israel and international companies for natural gas exploration in Palestine maritime areas off the coast of Gaza. Several organizations-Al Mezan Center for Human Rights and the Palestinian Center for Human Rights-warn Israel it had better cancel those contracts or face the consequences for violating international law. In a world, however, where Israel repeatedly violates international law-including orders from the World Court to stop killing Palestinians and provide massive humanitarian aid -- it's unlikely those contracts will be canceled any time soon unless there is a tsunami of civil unrest or a collective uproar in the 193-member UN General Assembly. Under the Uniting for Peace resolution the General Assembly could with a 2/3rd's vote (129 members) exert enormous pressure by sanctioning Israel and suspending it from UN activities.\n\nInternal dissent rocks Google in the United States, where employees waving Palestinian flags shut down Market Street (12/14/23) in San Francisco to protest Google's Project Nimbus, a 1.2 billion contract with the Israeli military for cloud computing engineered by Google and Amazon. Months earlier, before October 7th, hundreds of Amazon and Google tech workers protested the contract in four cities across the country with signs reading, \"No Tech for Apartheid.\" In an open letter, anonymous employees in 2021 charged the Nimbus contract greenlights \"unlawful data collection on Palestinians, and facilitates expansion of Israel's illegal settlements on Palestinian land.\"\n\nMultinational corporations like Microsoft, Google, IBM and Intel all have offices in Israel. Google's 8,000 square mile campus in Tel Aviv occupies eight floors of Electra Tower, with one floor reserved for Google's \"Campus Tel Aviv,\" a hub for entrepreneurs and start up companies. Hewlett-Packard-a target of the global BDS movement- profits off the Israeli occupation with biometric identification-hand and facial recognition-used at checkpoints throughout the West Bank, where excruciating wait times can take Palestinians all day to reach family in a village 30 miles away.\n\nA boycott of Israel's technology-computers, electronics, cybersecurity software-could send Israel's economy into an inflationary spiral, for high tech contributes 18% of the gross domestic product, employs over 12% of the workforce, accounts for half the country's exports and contributes 30% of the tax base, according to CNN.\n\nIsrael's surveillance technology includes Pegasus spyware that can invade your cell phone, capture text messages and collect passwords, border drones that monitor the movement of migrants across the Mediterranean, thermal cameras that can see through walls during police raids and facial recognition software for cameras at checkpoints and borders.\n\nOne of Israel's biggest trading partners is the European Union, which in 2018 purchased Elbit Systems drones to track and collect intelligence on asylum seekers. Critics charge the use of these drones without offering rescue operations for refugees risking their lives violates the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. The Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has long wanted the contracts canceled. Professor Richard Falk, Chair of Euro-Med's Board of Trustees, said the purchase is outrageous considering the \"repressive and unlawful ways\" drones are used to oppress Palestinians in the occupied territories.\n\nIn the UAE, where dissent is outlawed and labor unions forbidden, those who might protest their country's cozy relationship with Israel risk prison and torture, so it's not surprising that the royal family easily welcomed an Israeli tech hub to Abu Dhabi in 2022 and announced plans for a UAE technology institute in Haifa come 2024. \"We will work on some of the most interesting challenges in AI and at the same time contribute to the vision of scientific collaboration articulated in the Abraham Accords,\" writes Yoelle Maarek, the soo-to-be director of the center, who previously worked as an executive at Google, IBM, Amazon, and Yahoo.\n\nAnother top shopper for Israeli tech is India, which, according to the New York Times, bought Pegasus Spyware in 2017 to keep tabs on opponents of Modi's ultra-nationalist regime.\n\nAnd it's no secret that Saudi Arabia is one of Israel's best customers for Israeli tech used to hack the phones and spy on people deemed enemies of the state. Though the planned normalization agreement between Saudi Arabia and Israel is off the table for now, Saudi Arabia's 620-billion Public Investment Fund (PIF) continues to invest in Israeli tech start-ups.\n\nComing attractions on the tech market ...\n\nThe Israeli military says it's relying on an artificial intelligence-based system called Habsora (the Gospel) to \"produce targets at a fast pace\" in Gaza, where to date Israel has killed over 28,000 and wounded over 68,000 people. Richard Moyes, a researcher for Article 36, a team of policy experts based in the UK, discounts the accuracy of AI algorithms, telling The Guardian, \"We're seeing the widespread flattening of an urban area with heavy explosive weapons, so to claim there's precision and narrowness of force being exerted is not borne out by the facts.\"\n\nWHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE\n\nIf nations anywhere in the supply chain are serious about ending genocide in Gaza and preventing a wider war, they can invoke the S in BDS and sanction Israel, prohibiting imports and exports of oil, weapons and technology. If the US, Canada, UK, Germany, India and the Arab countries complicit in Israel's slaughter refuse to reverse course-if they insist on aiding and abetting genocide in the face of the International Court of Justice's condemnation and global outrage over Israel's slaughter, then it's time for other countries to expose Israel and its abetters in a criminal tribunal on the floor of the United Nations to put the criminals, from Biden to Netanyahu, on trial for genocide.\n\nUntil that time, CODEPINK joins the global call to the UN General Assembly to sanction Israel as it brazenly violates International Court of Justice orders to stop killing and wounding Palestinians and start providing massive humanitarian aid. Our New York City delegation, which has encouraged countries to file declarations in support of South Africa's case at the ICJ, delivers a strategic message as the delegation visits the UN missions: \"NO MORE WEAPONS, OIL OR TECH FOR ISRAEL.\"\n\nIt may be cliche to say, \"If there's a will, there's a way,\" but the truth is the collective power of the world-or even a sliver of the world-could stop the slaughter tomorrow.",

Palestinians have been suffering since 1917 when the British entered the country.\"\n\nHe said the present Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the most \"extreme\" in the history of Israel, and 2.3 million people in Palestine have been living in an open prison for 17 years now.\n\n\"What's the target of this aggression?

The UNRWA (United Nations Relief and Works Agency) has also been attacked.
