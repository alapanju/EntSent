        "text": "Sports Minister Anurag Thakur has requested IOC to let India host the 2036 Olympics.\n\nSports Minister Anurag Thakur said on Sunday \"it makes more sense for the IOC\" to give India the hosting rights for the 2036 Olympic Games as the country is growing by leaps and bounds in every sphere including sports.\n\nThakur, while speaking at the News9 Global Summit, said India's recent performance at mega international events, such as the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Hangzhou Asian Games, gives him hope that the country could become a top-10 sporting nation by 2036 and be in the top-5 by 2047.\n\n\"We had the largest population to see the Olympic sports last time (in 2020 Tokyo) and this time, it makes more sense for the IOC to give 2036 Olympics to none other than Bharat, our India,\" said Thakur.\n\n\"We have become the fifth-largest economy in the world\" - Anurag Thakur\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has already expressed the country's desire to host the Olympics in 2036 during the IOC session in Mumbai last year, and when asked if India was ready to hold the mega event and which city could play host, Thakur said, \"PM Modi made it very clear during the IOC session that India is very serious to host the 2036 Summer Olympics, and before that we want to host the 2030 Youth Olympics. And, I have a reason to say so.\n\n\"If you look at India in the last 10 years, we have become the fifth-largest economy in the world. If you look at sector to sector, India is doing extremely well...economy-wise fifth largest, next five years, we are going to be the third largest.\n\n\"By 2036, the Indian economy would be much larger, sports infrastructure is also getting better and better with each passing day. We have 1.4 billion population, out of which 65 per cent is below 35. That is 1/6th of the total population of the world lives in India, so what could be a bigger market (for Olympics).\n\n\"Then, the target I have set for 2036, India will be among the top-10 medal winning countries, and (by) 2047, among the top-5 to win medals,\" he said.\n\n\"I think the time has started when the country's mindset has changed\" - Anurag Thakur\n\nThakur foresees Olympic disciplines too enjoying a huge following and compared it with where cricket was before the country won the World Cup for the first time and how massively things have changed now.\n\n\"If you look at 1983 (World Cup win), before that even in cricket we didn't have enough money. When the team won the World Cup, even the BCCI didn't have enough money to pay them (winning team players), or to celebrate in a big way.\n\n\"But when they (BCCI) fought the case against Prasar Bharati and won the case, that is where they won the telecast rights and the game changed. Then money came into cricket. That is how the BCCI have done well with their professional working in the last so many years.\n\n\"In the last 2-3 decades, we have seen so many cricketers doing well on the international stage. So, in cricket we had a lot of stars to look up to. And, today, in other sports too we have a lot of starts to look up to. I think the time has started when the country's mindset has changed,\" he added.\n\nHe said the government's focus on creating sports infrastructure in the last 10 years and pumping in money gave him confidence.\n\n\"The sports budget has been increased three times in the last 10 years. We have spent 3,000 crores in creating 300 sports infrastructure. We have a lot of schemes for the benefit of players, so that they can perform better rather than worry about the facilities... how they can train, where to train, who will fund them. That is not their worry today, they all need to train hard and perform.",

Thus, a development deficit is still seen in the Kandi area. After Prime Minister Narendra Modi took over in 2014, the priority has been to bring the leftout areas into the development mainstream to end the development-deficit syndrome,\" he said.\n\nReiterating Modi's vision of to create a \"Viksit Bharat & Viksit Jammu and Kashmir\", the minister said the government is focussed on the poor, farmers, youth and women empowerment.\n\n\"The poor, farmers, youth and the 'Nari Shakti' have been empowered through various government welfare schemes as this government believes in the 'Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas' mantra,\" he said.\n\nIn terms of road and highways development, Singh said north India's first ever cable-stayed bridge -- the Atal Setu -- and Jammu and Kashmir's first inter-state bridge at Keerian-Gandyal have been the cornerstones of development never imagined by anyone.\n\n\"The Aroma Mission has been started by neighbouring states such as Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. As this constituency has been the birthplace of the purple revolution, Basohli must not shy away from starting lavender cultivation as this can increase manifold the incomes of agriculturists of the area,\" he said.

        "text": "Addressing the gathering in Dwarka PM Modi said that the grand old party used their full strength and energy to hide their corruption.\n\n\"That's why they could make India only the 11th largest economy in the world in their 10 years. The budget, which used to be for infrastructure, was looted through scams. Congress did the 2G scam, a Commonwealth scam, a helicopter scam, and a submarine scam. Congress has only betrayed every need of the country.\"\n\n\"Scams worth thousands of crores which used to take place during the previous governments have all been stopped now\", he remarked, underlining that the nation has leapfrogged to become the 5th largest economy in 10 years.\n\n\"The entire strength of the Congress has been used to take one family forward. If everything was to be done only for one family then how would one remember to build the country? Its entire energy was focused on how to run the government for five years and how to hide scams,\" PM Modi said.\n\nEmphasizing that his government's commitment to put an end to all scams has resulted in the country's progress and the creation of grand infrastructure.\n\nAs a result, the Prime Minister said, one can witness the reemergence of places of divine faith and pilgrimage on one hand while the development of new India through mega projects on the other.\n\nHe gave examples of the Sudarshan Setu, India's longest cable-based in Gujarat, the country's longest sea bridge in Mumbai, the magnificent bridge built on Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir, the under-construction New Pamban Bridge which is India's first vertical lift bridge in Tamil Nadu and India's longest river bridge in Assam. \"Such modern connectivity is the way to build a prosperous and strong nation\", he added.\n\nHighlighting the importance of connectivity for the growth of tourism in the country, the Prime Minister illustrated the point by elaborating on Gujarat becoming a hub of tourism due to improved connectivity.\n\nTalking about the new attraction of Gujarat, the Prime Minister said that today, there are 22 sanctuaries and 4 national parks in Gujarat.\n\nThousands of years old port city Lothal is discussed all over the world. Today Ahmedabad city, Rani Ki Vav, Champaner and Dholavira have become World Heritage. Shivrajpuri is a blue flag beach in Dwarka. Asia's longest ropeway is in Girnar. Gir forest is the only habitat of the Asiatic Lion.\n\nThe World's tallest statue, Sardar Saheb's Statue of Unity is in Ekta Nagar. Today a fair of tourists from all over the world are organized during Ranotsav. Dhordo village of Kutch is counted among the best tourist villages in the world. Nadabet is becoming an important center of patriotism and tourism.\n\nHe pointed out that in line with the mantra of 'Vikas bhi Virasat bhi', centers of faith are being upgraded. Facilities have been developed in all important pilgrimage sites such as Dwarka, Somnath, Pavagadh, Modhera and Ambaji.

The projects encompass important sectors like health, road, rail, energy, petroleum & natural gas, and tourism among others.\n\nAddressing the gathering, the Prime Minister acknowledged the virtual presence of Hon'ble Governors and Chief Ministers of States, Members of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies and Union Ministers and thanked them. The Prime Minister recalled the time when all key development programs were carried out in New Delhi alone and highlighted that the present government changed the trend and took the Government of India to every corner of the nation. \"Today's organization in Rajkot is a proof of this belief\", PM Modi said, underlining that the dedication and foundation stone laying ceremony is taking place in multiple locations in the country as it takes forward a new tradition. Recalling the inauguration of educational institutions of IIT Bhilai, IIT Tirupati, IIIT Kurnool, IIM Bodh Gaya, IIM Jammu, IIM Visakhapatnam and IIS Kanpur from a program in Jammu, Prime Minister Modi said that today marks the inauguration of AIIMS Rajkot, AIIMS Raebareli, AIIMS Mangalagiri, AIIMS Bathinda and AIIMS Kalyani. \"The developing India is getting work done at a fast pace, especially when you look at these 5 AIIMSs\", Shri Modi added.\n\nThe Prime Minister recalled his long association with Rajkot and said that 22 years ago he was elected MLA from here. On 25th February 22 years ago, he took oath as the MLA. He said that he has done his best to live up to the trust of the people of Rajkot. \"I can see that generations have changed but affection for Modi is beyond any age limit\", said a grateful Prime Minister.\n\nApologizing for the delay in today's programme, the Prime Minister told the audience about his activities in Dwaraka earlier during the day where he inaugurated and laid the foundation stones of many development works including Sudarsan Setu. He once again narrated his divine experience of offering prayer at the submerged holy city of Dwarka. \"Reading the archaeological and religious text fills us with wonder about Dwarka. Today I got an opportunity to see that holy scene with my own eyes and I could touch the holy remains. I offered prayers and offered 'Mor-Pankh' there. It is difficult to describe that feeling\", said the Prime Minister, still overcome with emotions from the experience. \"In those depths, I was wondering about the glorious past of India. When I came out, I came out carrying the blessings of Bhagwan Krishna as well as the inspiration of Dwarka\", the Prime Minister said. \"This gave a new strength and energy to my resolution of 'Vikas aur Virasat'. A divine belief has become associated with my goal for Viksit Bharat\", he added.\n\nNoting the development projects of today worth more than Rs 48,000 crores, the Prime Minister mentioned the New Mundra-Panipat pipeline commissioned to transport crude oil from the Gujarat coast to Indian Oil's refinery in Panipat in Haryana. He also mentioned projects related to roads, railways, electricity, health and education. \"AIIMS Rajkot is now dedicated to the nation after the inauguration of the International Airport\", the Prime Minister said, congratulating the people of Rajkot and Saurashtra. He also conveyed his best wishes to citizens of all cities where AIIMS is being inaugurated today.\n\n\"Today marks a historic occasion not just for Rajkot but the entire nation\", Prime Minister Modi said, highlighting that Rajkot today presents a glimpse of the desired levels of health facilities in Viksit Bharat. He pointed out that the nation had only one AIIMS for 50 years of independence, that too in Delhi. He added that even though only seven AIIMS were commissioned during the seven decades of independence, some of them couldn't be completed. \"In the last 10 days, the nation has witnessed the foundation stone laying and inauguration of seven new AIIMS\", the Prime Minister remarked, highlighting that the present government has accomplished things at a faster pace than what was done in the last 70 years, thereby taking the country on the path of development. He also mentioned laying the foundation stone and dedicating more than 200 health infrastructure projects including medical colleges, satellite centers of multi-speciality hospitals and centers for the treatment of worrying ailments.\n\nReiterating the promise of 'Modi ki Guarantee meaning the guarantee of fulfillment of guarantee' the Prime Minister said that the foundation stone for Rajkot AIIMS was laid by him 3 years ago and today that guarantee was fulfilled. Similarly, a guarantee of an AIIMS was given to Punjab and the foundation stone as well as inauguration was done by PM Modi. The same cycle has taken place for Raebareli, Mangalgiri, Kalyani, and Rewari AIIMS. In the last 10 years, 10 new AIIMS have been sanctioned in different states. \"Modi ki guarantee begins where expectations from others end\", said PM Modi.\n\nThe Prime Minister said that the pandemic could be handled in a credible manner due to the improvements in the healthcare system and infrastructure in the last 10 years.

He also mentioned WHO's global center related to the traditional medical system is also being built here in Gujarat.\n\nIn a bid towards helping the poor and middle class save money while also availing better healthcare facilities, the Prime Minister threw light on the Ayushman Bharat Yojna which has helped save Rs 1 lakh crore, and Jan Aushadhi Centers that provide medicines at an 80% discount thereby saving Rs 30 thousand crores. Under the Ujjwala Yojna, the poor have saved more than Rs 70,000 crores, citizens have saved Rs 4,000 every month due to low cost of mobile data and taxpayers have saved about Rs 2.5 lakh crores due to tax-related reforms.\n\nThe Prime Minister also elaborated on the PM Suryaghar Scheme that will bring the electricity bill to zero and will create income for the families. Beneficiaries will get 300 units of free electricity and the remaining power will be purchased by the government.

The royal family of Congress only indulged in politics in Raebareli, while the work was done by Modi,\" he said.\n\nIndia managed to defeat the COVID-19 pandemic because of changes in the health care system brought about in the last 10 years, the PM said.\n\n\"Today in Rajkot we got a glimpse of how the health sector of the world's fifth largest economy should be and what will be the level of health facilities in developed India,\" he said.\n\nModi said his government had carried out unprecedented expansion in AIIMS and medical colleges as well as critical infrastructure network by opening more than one lakh 'Ayushman Arogya Mandirs' in villages, and taking the number of medical colleges to 706 from 308-309 a decade back.\n\nThe number of MBBS and medical PG seats have increased during this period to more than one lakh and 70,000, respectively, from 50,000 and 30,000, he informed.\n\nThe priority of his government was towards prevention of diseases by increasing the capacity to fight them, the PM said.\n\n\"We have focused on nutrition, Yoga, AYUSH and cleanliness so that diseases can be prevented,\" he said.\n\nTwo hospitals and research centres for Yoga and naturopathy have been inaugurated in Maharashtra and Haryana as part of such efforts, the PM said.\n\nIt is the constant endeavour of the Union government to ensure the poor and the middle class get quality medical treatment, he said.\n\nThe Ayushman Bharat scheme has helped the poor save Rs 1 lakh crore, while medicines at 80 per cent discount have helped the poor and the middle class save Rs 30,000 crore, the PM told the gathering.\n\nThe Ujjwala Yojana (to provide clean fuel through LPG connections) has helped poor families save Rs 70,000 crore, he said.\n\nCheaper data has helped every mobile phone user save Rs 4,000 every month, and tax reforms have helped taxpayers save Rs 2.5 lakh crore, the PM said.

He was speaking at the valedictory of the 'Constitution and National Unity Convention -2024' here.\n\n\"Many people are trying to erase or change the Constitution. If you don't stand strong and united in the upcoming election and if the Constitution is affected, it is certain that there will be a dictatorship in this country in the days to come. Whether you want dictatorship or want to lead a life with justice, (deciding that) is important,\" Kharge said.\n\n\"If the Constitution survives, the unity of this country will survive. If democracy survives, every one can live with prosperity. But today there is no government at the Centre that either protects the Constitution or functions keeping the Constitution in mind,\" he added. This is why protecting the Constitution and abiding by it is most important, he said, in his address to the gathering. Kharge called on the citizens to be aware of efforts to mislead them by trying to impose a certain ideology.\n\nHe claimed that there was a conspiracy underway to frame a new Constitution by giving up the existing one. \"(Prime Minister Narendra) Modi speaks about protecting the Constitution, but why are the protectors of the Constitution using the ED (on opposition leaders), purchasing MLAs of opposition parties to take control of opposition-ruled states or governments as done in Karnataka, Manipur and Goa? How far is this constitutional,\" Kharge said. If this \"obsession\" continues, there may be a day when there will be a dictatorship in this country, he added.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is used to saying \"my guarantee\" instead of \"Government's guarantees\" or at least \"BJP government's guarantees\", Kharge said. \"How is it your (Modi) guarantee?

Union Minister of State for Agriculture, Farmers' Welfare and Food Processing Industries Shobha Karandlaje and former party chief Nalin Kumar Kateel, respectively, are now representing the two constituencies. The former Congress Minister Pramod Madhwaraj, who joined the BJP in 2022, and the former Udupi district unit BJP chief Kuilady Suresh Nayak too are lobbying for the Udupi-Chikkamagalur seat.\n\nKishore D. Suvarna, secretary of the All-India Fishermen's Association, Udupi, has openly demanded the BJP ticket for Mr. Madhwaraj. In a video that went viral recently, he took Ms. Karandlaje to the task at a meeting in Udupi, questioning her inability to get the road connecting to Malpe Fisheries Harbour widened into a four-lane way. A visibly miffed Minister hit back at him.\n\nFor the Dakshina Kannada seat, the former State secretary of the BJP Backward Classes Morcha Sathyajit Surathkal and the former chairman of the Karnataka Fisheries Development Corporation Ramachandra Baikampady are aspirants. Mr. Surathkal and his fans held open meetings at Puttur and B.C. Road recently demanding ticket for him.\n\nWith so many aspirants, it would be interesting to see whether some will enter the fray as rebel candidates in case the ticket is denied.\n\nAll in the family\n\nAnganwadi workers of Tarikere taluk recently staged a protest, urging the State government to fulfil their demands. They visited the office of Tarikere MLA G.H. Srinivas to submit their memorandum. The MLA was not at the office. Instead, his wife, Vani Srinivas, accepted the memorandum. Not just that, she posed for the cameras while receiving the memorandum and also assured the protesters that she would bring the issue to the attention of those concerned through her husband.\n\nFor people in the Tarikere Assembly constituency, family members of Mr. Srinivas taking part in both private and official programmes is nothing new. For many days, the MLA's wife and daughter have been attending events on his behalf. The legislator's wife takes part in ground-breaking ceremonies of government works in gram panchayats, while his daughter Rachana holds meetings with members of gram panchayats on problems being faced by them.\n\nBanter on 'adjustment politics'\n\nTalk of \"adjustment politics\", which had made a big noise in the run-up to the 2023 Assembly elections in Karnataka, became a topic of banter during the Budget session of the State legislature. During the reply to the motion of thanks to the Governor's address in the Legislative Assembly last week, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah took a jibe at the BJP by saying that the party lost the Assembly elections despite \"making Prime Minister Modi roam the streets.\"\n\nImmediately, Basanagouda Patil Yatnal (BJP) stood up and said, \"We lost because of adjustments you people have made. We were not defeated because of the BJP or the former Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai.\" Mr. Siddaramaiah hit back and taunted Mr. Yatnal about his chief ministerial ambitions. Mr. Yatnal retorted, \"No, I have no ambition of becoming the Chief Minister as long as you people are involved in adjustment politics.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Siddaramaiah dared Mr. Yatnal to name the leaders involved in the so-called adjustment politics, Mr. Bommai intervened and said quite mysteriously, \"All of us, including you and me, have many secrets in the depths of our hearts. One day, they will explode.\" Mr. Siddaramaiah replied, \"You have spoken many things outside. But this is the only truth you have spoken inside the House!\"",

All kinds of scams used to take place under the Congress regime, Modi said, adding that his government stopped all those things in the last 10 years.\n\nThe Congress lacked the will and intention to provide amenities to people, he said. The PM was speaking after inaugurating and laying the foundation stones for various projects in Dwarka, including India's longest cable-stayed bridge between Okha and Beyt Dwarka here in Gujarat.\n\n\"Those who ruled the country for a long time did not have the willpower, intention and dedication to provide amenities to the common people,\" Modi said.\n\n\"The entire strength of the Congress has been used to take one family forward. If everything was to be done only for one family then how would one remember to build the country? Its (Congress) entire energy was focused on how to run the government for five years and how to hide scams,\" Modi said.\n\nThe Congress could make India's economy only the 11th largest because the party could not fulfil big dreams of the people of a vast nation, Modi said. His government's commitment to put an end to all scams has resulted in the country's progress and the creation of grand infrastructure like the longest cable-stayed bridge connecting Beyt Okha and mainland Okha, the PM pointed out.\n\n\"Sudarshan Setu\" boasts of a unique design, featuring a footpath adorned with verses from Srimad Bhagavad Gita and images of Lord Krishna on both sides. On the 'Sudarshan Setu', the PM said he laid the foundation stone for this bridge six years ago and inaugurated it today.\n\n\"This is Modi's guarantee,\" he added. When the economy was small, it could not fulfil huge dreams of a vast nation, he said, adding that whatever little budget was earmarked for infrastructure was looted by way of scams.\n\nWhen the time came to improve telecom infrastructure, the Congress created the 2G scam and when it was time to strengthen sports infrastructure, the Congress created the Commonwealth scam, the PM said.\n\nWhen it was the time to strengthen the defence infrastructure, the Congress indulged in the helicopter and submarine scam, he added \"The Congress can only betray every need of the country. In 2014, when you all blessed me and sent me to Delhi, I had promised you all I will not let the country be looted. Scams worth several thousands of crores that used to happen during the Congress era have all been stopped,\" he asserted.\n\nIn the last 10 years, his government has made the country's economy the fifth largest in the world, and as a result such grand and divine constructions are taking place all over, which was creating \"the new picture of new India\", he said.\n\nThe sea bridge (Atal Setu) in Mumbai, the (railway) bridge on Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir, the under-construction vertical lift bridge in Tamil Nadu and a river bridge in Assam are examples of such mega projects, he pointed out.\n\nThe PM said he was fortunate to get a chance to inaugurate the bridge, the foundation stone of which he had laid six years ago.\n\n\"The bridge will connect Beyt Dwarka island to Okha mainland and add to the beauty of the place. Whatever was dreamed of, and whose foundation stone was laid was fulfilled. This is the guarantee of Modi, a servant of the public,\" he asserted.\n\nThe 'Sudarshan Setu' is not just another bridge but an engineering marvel that will reduce dependency of tourists and pilgrims on ferry boats. \"Modern connectivity is a way to build a prosperous and strong nation,\" the PM reiterated.\n\nAs chief minister of Gujarat, he had placed the idea of such a bridge in front of the (Congress-ruled) Centre several times but the latter never paid attention to it, Modi said.\n\nAsserting that several tourist and pilgrimage spots in Gujarat had been improved leading to these becoming favoured places for international tourists, he asked people to ensure the cleanliness of Dwarka for tourists.\n\nOut of 85 lakh tourists who visited India, a fifth visited Gujarat. \"Till August last year, 15.5 lakh tourists visited Gujarat. The e-visa facility for international tourists has helped Gujarat, and created new opportunities for employment and self-employment,\" he said.",

According to this development, 1150 cusecs of Ravi water is going to be utilized to irrigate more than 32,000 hectares of land in the Jammu and Kashmir districts of Kathua and Samba, rather than spilling into Pakistan.\n\nThe irrigation and hybrid power generation project has encountered many difficulties during the last thirty years, based on official sources. The process of pondage at Shahpur commenced barely two days ago, after the conclusion of the barrage work. Nonetheless, Shahpur's water retention process has already started with the completion of the barrage.\n\nIndia will now use all of the water from the Ravi River, as stipulated under the Indus Water Treaty. Water that once flowed towards Pakistan from the ancient Lakhanpur dam will now serve purposes in Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir. After the Shahpur Kandi barrage was successfully completed, the old Lakhanpur dam's water resources were redirected towards the two northern states, allowing India to make the most of the Ravi River's water resources.\n\nIndia has exclusive rights over the waters of the Ravi, Sutlej and Beas rivers, while Pakistan has authority over the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab rivers, as per the 1960 Indus Water Treaty between the two countries. India's capacity for water management is further enhanced by the treaty's clauses, which allow it to build storage facilities on the western rivers.\n\nFormer Prime Minister late PV Narsimha Rao had laid the foundation stone of the significant Shahpur Kandi Barrage Project in 1995. However, internal disagreements between the governments of J&K and Punjab presented numerous challenges for the project from the outset. The project was put on hold for multiple years before being revived in 2018 after a four and a half-year pause owing to the intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office, Dr. Jitendra Singh.\n\nThe sources revealed, \"This multipurpose project worth Rs 3300 crores (Revised cost) would not only provide 1150 cusecs of irrigation water to the J&K and over 5000 cusecs of water to Punjab state, but also generate about 206 MW of electricity besides attracting tourists to the site. Punjab state would be the major beneficiary of the power generated from this project.\"\n\nDr. Jitendra Singh also made a statement in which he asserted that political reasons alone prevented the project from moving forward in Jammu and Kashmir, even though it would have benefited the districts of Samba and Kathua. He recounted, \"In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was briefed about Shahpur Kandi project and its benefits. He set up high level committee under the chairmanship of PM's then Principal Secretary Nripendra Mishra. Even former Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti tried to sabotage the project by raising the demand of Rs 600 crore compensation from Punjab Government.\"\n\nHe mentioned that the project was awarded national project status, allowing for its prompt completion, and that it was resurrected after 40 years due to the imposition of Governor's Rule in Jammu and Kashmir as a result of PM Modi's efforts and initiative.\n\nAjit Kumar, the Executive Engineer at RTIC Kathua, confirmed in a phone conversation that the pondage process has commenced and that water from Ranjeet Sagar Dam is being discharged in a methodical way for the Shahpur Kandi barrage. He noted that the Shahpur Kandi dam will reach its necessary height in ninety days.\n\nIn response to a query, he stated that the project's budget was altered multiple times. The project was originally estimated to have cost Rs 2793 crores, but its current updated cost is Rs 3300 crores. The development of a 206 MW hydropower project is also included in the project cost. The Power House is being built approximately three kilometers from Shahpur Kandi and according to the agreement, Punjab State will be the primary recipient of the electricity produced there, with J&K receiving no share of it.\n\nWhen asked how much water J&K and Punjab will receive from the Ravi River, the Executive Engineer replied that J&K would receive a maximum of 1150 cusecs, while Punjab state would receive 5000 cusecs. According to him, the Ravi-Tawi canal has a design capacity of 1350 cusecs, and Punjab's authorities would release water in line with our expected demand.\n\nHe added, \"We can, however, request a maximum of 1150 cusecs of water. In addition to other regions of Kathua, Rajbagh, Sanji Morh, Mareen, Hiranagar, Rajpura, Samba, Vijaypur, and Ramgarh, and others, roughly 32,000 hectres of land in the Kandi belt of Kathua and Samba, nearly 82 kilometers in length up to Ramgarh sub division would be irrigated. It will be a huge relief for the farmers in this belt.\"\n\nHe further revealed that work on a 1378-meter stretch of the canal that runs from the Shahpur Kandi barrage to the J&K intake point is still outstanding, approximately a month and a half in duration. He stated that construction is underway on a nearly 20-meter bridge close to the Lakhanpur village of Kulyarh, while head regulators are being expected as part of mechanical work on the J&K side of the canal. He pointed out that the remaining work will be finished in little more than 45 days well in advance of the barrage's required water level.\n\nIn reply to a different question, he replied that it is anticipated that Shahpur Kandi Power House will begin producing energy by the end of the following year based on inputs. He claimed that following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's participation and designation of the project as a Project of National Importance, real work on the project began in 2018. He highlighted, \"Ranjit Sagar Dam which is about 11 kilometres upstream of this project, is already generating over 600 MW of power and 206 MW will be additional benefit from river Ravi with Shahpur Kandi project.\"\n\nIndia has built storage facilities including the Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej, the Pong and Pandoh Dam on the Beas, and the Thein (Ranjitsagar) on the Ravi as part of a number of water management projects. India is now able to use almost all (95%) of the water from the eastern rivers because to these efforts and other projects like the Indira Gandhi Nahar Project and the Beas-Sutlej link. However, below Madhopur, almost 2 million acre-feet of the Ravi River's water flowed to Pakistan without being harnessed. India is well-positioned to capitalize on these water resources, promoting agricultural and economic growth in Jammu & Kashmir and Punjab, with the completion of the Shahpur Kandi barrage.\n\nDuring a rally in 2026, Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to make sure that Indian farmers could effectively use the waters of the Sutlej, Beas and Ravi rivers. He underlined that India has a legitimate claim to these waterways and that Pakistan must stop wasting them. To ensure that every drop of water from these rivers reaches Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir, a task force was subsequently formed.",

And, I have a reason to say so.\n\n\"If you look at India in the last 10 years, we have become the fifth-largest economy in the world. If you look at sector to sector, India is doing extremely well...economy-wise fifth largest, next five years, we are going to be the third largest.\n\n\"By 2036, the Indian economy would be much larger, sports infrastructure is also getting better and better with each passing day. We have 1.4 billion population, out of which 65 per cent is below 35. That is 1/6th of the total population of the world lives in India, so what could be a bigger market (for Olympics).\n\n\"Then, the target I have set for 2036, India will be among the top-10 medal winning countries, and (by) 2047, among the top-5 to win medals,\" he said.\n\nThakur foresees Olympic disciplines too enjoying a huge following and compared it with where cricket was before the country won the World Cup for the first time and how massively things have changed now.\n\n\"If you look at 1983 (World Cup win), before that even in cricket we didn't have enough money. When the team won the World Cup, even the BCCI didn't have enough money to pay them (winning team players), or to celebrate in a big way.\n\n\"But when they (BCCI) fought the case against Prasar Bharati and won the case, that is where they won the telecast rights and the game changed. Then money came into cricket. That is how the BCCI have done well with their professional working in the last so many years.\n\n\"In the last 2-3 decades, we have seen so many cricketers doing well on the international stage. So, in cricket we had a lot of stars to look up to. And, today, in other sports too we have a lot of starts to look up to. I think the time has started when the country's mindset has changed,\" he added.\n\nHe said the government's focus on creating sports infrastructure in the last 10 years and pumping in money gave him confidence.\n\n\"The sports budget has been increased three times in the last 10 years. We have spent 3,000 crores in creating 300 sports infrastructure. We have a lot of schemes for the benefit of players, so that they can perform better rather than worry about the facilities... how they can train, where to train, who will fund them. That is not their worry today, they all need to train hard and perform.\n\n\"That is why India has won 100-plus (107) medals in the Hangzhou Asian Games. At one time, a rickshaw-puller's or a tea seller's son used to worry how he will reach the top level in sports. After Khelo India and Target Olympics Podium Scheme (TOPS), boarding, lodging and training etc is taken care of and elite athletes get Rs six lakh pocket money as well.\n\n\"Besides, 3000 athletes are being funded by government in private academies so that they can train well and play for India. 23 National Centres of Excellence (NCOEs), 69 SAI centres and 1,075 Khelo India centres have been completed. That is the speed, size and scale we are working today,\" he added, urging the state governments also to help.",

        "text": "Scuba diving in Dwarka is conducted off the coast of Dwarka near an island called Bet Dwarka, where people can see the underwater remains of ancient Dwarka that have been excavated by archaeologists\n\nAre you enticed by the idea of exploring the submerged ancient city of Dwarka in Gujarat, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought spiritual solace through prayer, encountering a profoundly divine and awe-inspiring experience? Well, you've arrived at the perfect destination, as we are about to guide you on the journey to the city of Lord Krishna, submerged in the waters.\n\nPM Modi on Sunday took a dip in the Arabian Sea at the site where the submerged city of Dwarka is believed to be. He went into the deep sea and visited the site, which is considered to be the original residence of the Hindu God Krishna and an ancient city, famous for its grandeur and prosperity.\n\nThe legends surrounding the ancient city of Dwarka, the land of Lord Krishna and one of India's seven holy pilgrimage sites, has religious as well as archaeological significance. The lost city, the \"ancient kingdom of Krishna\", which is mentioned in the epic Mahabharata, is believed to have sunk beneath the Arabian Sea after the death of Lord Krishna. It is said to have spread across nearly 84 km as a fortified city where the Gomti River and the Arabian Sea met.\n\nDwarka is located in the state of Gujarat on the western shore of the Okhamandal Peninsula on the right bank of the Gomti River at the mouth of the Gulf of Kutch facing the Arabian Sea.\n\nDwarka is well connected via air rail and road to major cities. While the nearest airport to the city is Jamnagar Airport, the Dwarka Railway station is connected to all major cities including Jamnagar, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Mumbai, Goa and many more.\n\nScuba diving in Dwarka is conducted off the coast of Dwarka near an island called Bet Dwarka, where people can see the underwater remains of ancient Dwarka that have been excavated by archaeologists. Besides the submerged remains of Dwarka, beautiful coral reefs spread out along the seafloor can be spotted. Since the water is clear here, you can also spot sea animals such as dolphins, turtles, octopuses and starfish.\n\nOne of the best and most popular locations for the activity is Shivrajpur Beach, which is accessible via public transportation. The nearest airport to the beach is Jamnagar Airport while the nearest railway station is Dwarka Railway station. The beach is also well connected to major cities in the state via roads.\n\nThe activity costs somewhere around Rs 2500-3500 and the best time to do it is between October and April.\n\nLast year in December, the Bhupendra Patel-led Gujarat government signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Mazagon Docks Ship Building yard to build tourist submarines for ferrying visitors to the submerged city of Dwarka.\n\nThese submarines -- with the capability of going up to 100 feet underwater -- will take tourists to Dwarka city.",

The budget, which used to be for infrastructure, was looted through scams. Congress did the 2G scam, a Commonwealth scam, a helicopter scam, and a submarine scam. Congress has only betrayed every need of the country.\"\n\n\"Scams worth thousands of crores which used to take place during the previous governments have all been stopped now\", he remarked, underlining that the nation has leapfrogged to become the 5th largest economy in 10 years.\n\nAlso Read | PM Modi Gujarat Visit: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Holds Roadshow in Rajkot (Watch Video).\n\n\"The entire strength of the Congress has been used to take one family forward. If everything was to be done only for one family then how would one remember to build the country? Its entire energy was focused on how to run the government for five years and how to hide scams,\" PM Modi said.\n\nEmphasizing that his government's commitment to put an end to all scams has resulted in the country's progress and the creation of grand infrastructure.\n\nAs a result, the Prime Minister said, one can witness the reemergence of places of divine faith and pilgrimage on one hand while the development of new India through mega projects on the other.\n\nHe gave examples of the Sudarshan Setu, India's longest cable-based in Gujarat, the country's longest sea bridge in Mumbai, the magnificent bridge built on Chenab in Jammu and Kashmir, the under-construction New Pamban Bridge which is India's first vertical lift bridge in Tamil Nadu and India's longest river bridge in Assam. \"Such modern connectivity is the way to build a prosperous and strong nation\", he added.\n\nHighlighting the importance of connectivity for the growth of tourism in the country, the Prime Minister illustrated the point by elaborating on Gujarat becoming a hub of tourism due to improved connectivity.\n\nTalking about the new attraction of Gujarat, the Prime Minister said that today, there are 22 sanctuaries and 4 national parks in Gujarat.\n\nThousands of years old port city Lothal is discussed all over the world. Today Ahmedabad city, Rani Ki Vav, Champaner and Dholavira have become World Heritage. Shivrajpuri is a blue flag beach in Dwarka. Asia's longest ropeway is in Girnar. Gir forest is the only habitat of the Asiatic Lion.\n\nThe World's tallest statue, Sardar Saheb's Statue of Unity is in Ekta Nagar. Today a fair of tourists from all over the world are organized during Ranotsav. Dhordo village of Kutch is counted among the best tourist villages in the world. Nadabet is becoming an important center of patriotism and tourism.\n\nHe pointed out that in line with the mantra of 'Vikas bhi Virasat bhi', centers of faith are being upgraded. Facilities have been developed in all important pilgrimage sites such as Dwarka, Somnath, Pavagadh, Modhera and Ambaji. He said every fifth tourist that visited India visited Gujarat.\n\nLast year about 15.5 lakh tourists came to Gujarat till August. e-Visa facilities are also bringing tourists to Gujarat, he said.

Today, if so much work is being done in the country under the Jal Jeevan Mission, water committees have had a big role to play in it. The leadership of these water committees lies only with women,\" Modi pointed out.\n\nApart from this, sisters and daughters are making all-out efforts for water conservation, he said.\n\nModi also spoke with Kalyani Prafulla Patil from Maharashtra and lauded her work in moving towards natural farming.\n\n\"Whether it is Sunita ji or Kalyani ji, the success of woman power in myriad fields is very inspiring.

Whenever a tiger comes near a village, local people get an alert on their mobile phones with the help of AI,\" the prime minister said.\n\nToday, this system has ensured convenience to the people in the 13 villages around this tiger reserve and the tigers have also got protection, he said.\n\nModi noted that young entrepreneurs are also working on new innovations for wildlife conservation and eco-tourism.\n\nIn Uttarakhand's Roorkee, Rotor Precision Group in collaboration with the Wildlife Institute of India has developed a drone which is helping keep an eye on the crocodiles in the Ken river, he said.\n\nSimilarly, Modi said, a Bengaluru company has created two mobile apps -- Bagheera and Garuda.\n\nWith the Bagheera app, the speed of a vehicle and other activities can be monitored during a jungle safari, and the Garuda app uses artificial intelligence and Internet of Things to provide real-time alerts when connected to any CCTV, Modi said.\n\nWith every such effort towards wildlife conservation, the country's biodiversity is becoming richer, he added.\n\nIn his address, Modi also talked about the voice of the youth creating content which he said has become very effective today.\n\n\"To honour their talent, the National Creators Award has been started in the country. Under this, preparations are being made to honour those change makers in different categories who are using technology to become effective voices of social change,\" Modi said.\n\n\"This contest is running on MyGov (portal) and I would urge content creators to join it.

        "title": "RLD-BJP Alliance: What Does the Changed Political Equations Now Hold for Western Uttar Pradesh?",
        "text": "Muzaffarnagar: A motorcycle rally led by the BJP passes through sugarcane fields in Budhana, Muzaffarnagar. The bikes are decorated with flags of the saffron party while a song plays in the background:\n\n'Mazdoor kisan ke haq mein ye alakh jagai re\n\nRLD aayi re, RLD aayi re'\n\n'(This awakening is happening in support of labourers and farmers, RLD [Rashtriya Lok Dal] has come, RLD has come).'\n\nThese sugarcane plots belong to Shobhan Singh, 80 who has seen the influence of the former prime minister Chaudhary Charan Singh in Uttar Pradesh politics. A chaupal has been set up, at the edge of the fields, where he sits with a hookah.\n\nSharing his thoughts, Shobhan says, \"Chaudhary Sahib deserved the Bharat Ratna but no past prime minister thought of honouring him in this manner. Now it is natural for Chaudhary Sahib's grandson Jayant to lean towards the BJP.\"\n\nThe villagers nod in agreement, puffing on their hookahs, wondering aloud farmer Shivam Choudhary says, \"Dadda, do you think that Bharat Ratna alone made Jayant Choudhary distance himself from the INDIA Alliance?\"\n\nRLD's prospects\n\nRLD chief Jayant Chaudhary who is known for his staunch opposition to the BJP truly shocked everyone by parting ways with the Samajwadi Party (SP) and switching loyalties to the NDA within hours of Bharat Ratna award announcement for Chaudhary Charan Singh on February 9.\n\nNext day, while speaking in the Rajya Sabha a turncoat Jayant said aloud, \"Having been in the opposition for 10 years, I see shades of Chaudhary Charan Singh's ideology in the present government's working style.\"\n\nA towering figure in farmer politics, Chaudhary Charan Singh, had devised a caste coalition formula then popularly known 'MAJGAR' (Muslim, Ahir, Jat, Gujjar, and Rajput communities) which contributed significantly to his success in the western part of Uttar Pradesh.\n\n\"Chaudhary Charan Singh was a grassroots leader, representing farmers of all castes. However, after his passing away, the party's appeal diminished, narrowing down to primarily representing the Jat community,\" says senior journalist Brijesh Shukla. \"The party's downfall can be attributed to its tendency to align with larger parties like the BJP and Congress, rather than focusing on strengthening its own foundation.\"\n\nAfter the 2014 elections, even the Jat support base of the RLD began to dwindle particularly on account of the divide between Muslims and Jats essentially following the infamous 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots which left more than 65 people dead and thousands displaced.\n\nAccording to CSDS post-poll studies on the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP garnered 77% of the Jat votes, a stark increase from the 7% it received in the 2012 Assembly elections. In the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, there was a considerable anticipation as an ambitious grand alliance of the Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and RLD was formed.\n\nWith Muslims, Jats and Dalits comprising approximately 60% of the voting population in Western Uttar Pradesh, the RLD harboured high hopes. However, when the results were announced, it sent shockwaves as both Ajit Singh and Jayant Chaudhary lost their seats once again, with the RLD failing to even open its account and the BJP took away 91% of the Jat vote share.\n\nThe 2022 Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, unfolded against the backdrop of massive farmer protests in the western region that had been ongoing for months. The RLD then in alliance with the SP hoped to bridge the gap between Muslims and Jats. However, the results remained shocking for RLD which failed to win more than 8 of the 33 seats it contested.\n\nBrijesh Shukla says, \"When the RLD failed to secure victory despite being part of the grand alliance in 2019 or amidst extensive farmer protests in 2022, when the odds were stacked against the BJP, it's difficult to see how they could emerge victorious in 2024. Jayant Chaudhary was already fighting a losing battle.\"\n\nJayant Choudhary's decision to join the NDA alliance is seen as a notable advantage for the RLD, signalling the possibility of the party securing a Lok Sabha seat for the first time in a decade.\n\nBJP's prospect\n\nIn the village of Firozpur Bangar in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Adityanath is seen engaging with villagers during a chaupal session, where he acquaints them with various beneficiary schemes initiated by the central and state governments. Additionally, the chief minister launches the BJP's Gram Parikrama Yatra in the state, slated to cover 50,000 villages across Uttar Pradesh. Following the chaupal, while addressing villagers in a rally, the chief minister says, \"Farmers have always greeted each other with 'Ram Ram,' 'Ram Ram Sa,' or 'Ram Ramji'. With the divine arrival of Lord Ram on one hand and the recognition of the farmer's leader, Chaudhary Charan Singh, with the Bharat Ratna on the other, I urge our farmers to convey their felicitations to Prime Minister Modi.\"\n\nThe chief minister's speech sheds light on the BJP's strategy in the region, highlighting four major issues the party is focusing in Western Uttar Pradesh: hindutva, utilising Chaudhary Charan Singh's legacy to woo Jayant and farmers, beneficiary schemes, and capitalising on Modi's popularity.\n\nShamshad Khan, psephologist and managing director of the PEACS news service says, \"Chaudhary Charan Singh commands immense respect in the region. By awarding him the Bharat Ratna, the BJP aims to accomplish two objectives: building goodwill among farmers and drawing RLD into their camp, thereby dealing a significant psychological blow to the INDIA alliance and SP.\"\n\nAdditionally the BJP is also working to get its caste equation right in the region. Laxmi Kant Bajpai, BJP Rajya Sabha MP from Meerut, says, \"Not only Jats, but we have also actively connected with numerically smaller communities in the region, such as Tyagis, Sainis, Gujjars, Lohaars, Kahaars, and Kanchis. Moreover, our various beneficiary schemes have significantly benefited these groups, and we expect even stronger support from them in the upcoming election.\"\n\nWith the BSP steadily losing its hold over its Dalit base, all political rivals are out to grab whatever they can out of the Dalit vote. And BJP appears to be way ahead of others, having already secured a substantial portion of Dalit voters from the BSP, the party is continuing its efforts to expand its support.\n\n\"The BJP has made substantial efforts toward the upliftment of SC and ST communities. Not only have our welfare schemes greatly benefited these communities but the BJP has also paid homage to icons like Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar and Birsa Munda, instilling confidence that Modi ji's leadership will continue to empower every downtrodden,\" says Asim Arun, former police commissioner of Kanpur and now minister of social welfare in the Uttar Pradesh government.\n\nSP's prospects\n\nBarely 21 days prior to the Bharat Ratna announcement to Chaudhary Charan Singh, Akhilesh Yadav posted a picture on X (formerly called Twitter) with Jayant Chaudhary at his residence saying, \"Congratulations to everyone on the RLD-SP alliance. Let's unite for victory.\"\n\nThe RLD and SP have been longstanding allies in the past few elections. This departure comes as a substantial blow to the SP as the party lacks its own social base in the region. The SP traditionally performs well in areas with a substantial Muslim and Yadav presence since these communities form their primary support base.\n\nThe absence of significant Yadav presence in the west Uttar Pradesh region, however, poses a challenge for the SP. With Jayant's departure, the party now needs to devise a new social arithmetic or identify a potential game-changer issue to maintain its standing.\n\nShamshad Khan says, \"The problem with the SP is that they were too dependent on Jayant and over the years because of the alliance they didn't develop their own leaders and cadre in the region.\"\n\nThough the SP is confident about countering the BJP-RLD alliance, Atul Pradhan, the party's MLA from Sardhana, Meerut says, \"People in the villages are unhappy about RLD leaving the alliance. Our focus on issues such as protecting the Constitution, speaking out against the harassment of protesting farmers and ensuring MSP is resonating strongly among the masses.\"\n\nAtul Pradhan presents a new electoral strategy, banking on the support from Dalit voters. He says, \"A significant shift is expected in west Uttar Pradesh among the Dalit voters. Recent by-polls in Mainpuri, Rampur, and Ghosi saw strong support from the scheduled caste voters for the SP and this trend will continue.\"\n\nBSP's prospects\n\nMayawati's BSP, once a formidable force in the western region, has seen a decline in its influence. The factors contributing to BSP's historical strength in Western Uttar Pradesh included the significant presence of Dalits, particularly Jatavs, a sub-caste to which Mayawati belongs, alongside support from Muslims who viewed the BSP-Jatav combination as a winning formula. Additionally, BSP had an array of influential leaders and a motivated cadre.\n\nHowever, political commentator Ajmal Rahi, who also runs an organisation for communal harmony in Muzaffarnagar, highlights the BSP's current situation, \"The BSP is almost finished in the region; they lack major issues, their cadres have weakened, and influential leaders have left the party.\"\n\nSome BSP leaders see Jayant's departure from the SP alliance as an opportunity to regain Muslim support by positioning BSP as the main alternative to the BJP. With BSP's Jatav base remaining strong, the alliance of Jatav and Muslim voters could pose a challenge to the BJP.\n\nRahi refutes and says, \"When alliance of SP and Congress is on one side, there is no chance Muslims will vote for Mayawati. Muslims have stopped trusting Mayawati from past few elections and have understood that BSP has surrendered in front of BJP.\"",

        "title": "Sugarcane Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) hike: How does it affect MSP & farmers?",
        "text": "The story so far: As farmers protest on Delhi borders, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Wednesday approved \u20b9340/quintal as the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of sugarcane for sugar season 2024-25 at 10.25% sugar recovery rate. Affirming its 'guarantee' to double farmers' income, the Centre pointed out that the new FRP was 8% higher than that offered in the current season 2023-24. The new FRP will kick in from October 1, 2024, announced Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Anurag Thakur at a press briefing on February 21.\n\nHailing his Cabinet's decision, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the increase in sugarcane purchase price would benefit crores of farmers.\n\nIn a press release, the Centre informed that the new FRP was 107% higher than the A2+FL cost of sugarcane, benefiting over 5 crore sugarcane farmer families and lakhs of others operating in the sugar sector. A2+FL cost is the actual cost incurred by the farmer on seeds, fertilizers, chemicals, hired labour, and the family labour (FL) working on the farm.\n\nElaborating on the decision, Centre stated that with each 0.1% increase in recovery, farmers will get additional price of \u20b93.32/quintal while the same amount will be deducted on reduction of recovery by 0.1%. With the minimum price being fixed at \u20b9315.10/quintal at 9.5% sugar recovery, farmers are assured of FRP at \u20b9 315.10/quintal. Sugar recovery refers in percentage terms to the amount of sugar obtained from a certain amount of sugarcane after processing.\n\n\"It is noteworthy that India is already paying the highest price of sugarcane in the world and despite that Government is ensuring the world's cheapest sugar to domestic consumers of Bharat,\" read the release. It also stated that due to Modi government's timely policy interventions, sugar mills have become self-sustainable and have not needed any financial assistance since 2021-22.\n\nALSO READ Why are farmers protesting again? | Explained What is Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP)?\n\nFair and Remunerative Price (FRP) is the minimum price sugar mills have to pay farmers for sugarcane. In 2009, amending the Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966, the Centre replaced the Statutory Minimum Price (SMP) of sugarcane with the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP). Various factors like cost of production of sugarcane, recovery of sugar from sugarcane, price at which sugar is sold, profit from sale of sugar by-products like molasses, bagasse and press mud, margin for sugarcane growers, return to sugarcane growers from alternative crops, are considered in the FRP.\n\nThe price is decided by the Centre based on recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) and in consultation with State governments and sugar industry. However, some States like Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab offer higher prices for sugarcane under State Advised Price (SAP), which mills in those States must abide by.\n\nHow does is affect Minimum Selling Price (MSP)?\n\nNot to be confused with Minimum Support Price for which farmers are currently marching to Delhi, the Minimum Selling Price for sugar was introduced by the Centre under the Sugar Price (Control) Order, 2018.\n\nWhile Minimum Support Price is the minimum price at which governments procure crops (cereals, pulses, oilseeds, cotton, jute and coconut) from farmers, the Minimum selling price (MSP) is the minimum price at which sugar mills can sell sugar to the market. The MSP was introduced by the Centre to ensure that the industry gets at least the minimum cost of production of sugar, allowing them to clear sugarcane dues of farmers. MSP is determined taking FRP and and adding minimum conversion cost incurred by sugar mills running at highest efficiency. While the Centre has repeatedly hiked the FRP from \u20b9255/quintal of sugarcane in 2017-18 to \u20b9340/quintal, it has not changed MSP from \u20b93100/quintal of sugar fixed in 2018-19.\n\nFarmers with tractor trollies waiting outside a Sugar Mill with their produce at Hasanpur village of Amroha Dist in Uttar Pradesh. | Photo Credit: Moorthy RV\n\nFarmers have often complained of not receiving sugarcane dues from mills. However, mills claim that the MSP being stagnant despite food inflation has exposed the industry to 'cash losses', raising challenges to paying FRP to farmers. Seeking Prime Minister Modi's intervention, the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NFCFS) which heads all cooperative sugar mills, and the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) which leads private mills, urged him to hike MSP to \u20b939.7/kg depending on quality.\n\nExplained | Will a hike in MSP help farmers?\n\nAn FRP of \u20b9305/quintal for sugarcane at a recovery of 10.25%, amounts to \u20b92,975.76 per quintal of sugar price, which is 96% of the MSP at Rs 3100/quintal. In its letter to the PM, the sugar mill bodies wrote, \"If raw material costs itself constitutes 96% share of the present MSP, it is next to impossible to manage the conversion cost of sugar and related financial costs within a 4% window\". Mills claim that whenever raw materials estimate went beyond 80%, the industry faced losses and turned to government for financial bail out.\n\nIn response, the Food secretary Sanjeev Chopra told Financial Express that the Centre will consider the demand for higher MSP in sync with the FRP paid to farmers. ISMA claims that the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices may recommend hiking sugar MSP from Rs 3100/quintal to Rs 3900/quintal.\n\nStates, farmers and FRP\n\nFarmers have often taken to the streets seeking higher FRP for sugarcane. With agriculture being both a State and Central subject in the Concurrent List of the Constitution, State governments facing the ire of farmers have often fixed procurement prices above the the FRP fixed by the Centre. This State Advised Price (SAP) burdens state-owned or private sugar mills with paying higher prices for sugarcane while keeping MSP at \u20b931/kg (\u20b93,100/quintal) for domestic sugar consumers.\n\nAsserting States' say in fixing sugarcane prices, a five-judge Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court on April 22, 2020, held that both the Central and State governments have such power. However, the Bench said that while a State cannot fix a \"minimum price\" if the Centre has already fixed it, the State is always welcome to fix the \"advised price\".\n\n\"So long the State Advised Price shall always be higher than the minimum price fixed by the Centre, it cannot be said to be void,\" ruled the Bench, adding that in case the advised price is lower, the price fixed by the Centre will prevail.\n\nThe States were further strengthened by the May 2023 Madras High Court judgement which said that the FRP fixed by the Centre was in reality not the fair market price at all, and that small and marginal farmers can survive only if State governments mandated a much higher 'advised price'. The two rulings have provided relief to farmers who are seeking dues from sugar mills.\n\nSugarcane farmers staging a demonstration in front of the Deputy Commissioner's office in Mysuru | Photo Credit: M A Sriram\n\nDuring the 2023-24 cane cutting season, farmers had agitated in major sugar producing States like Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh saying that the FRP fixed by the Centre did not even cover cultivation costs.\n\nALSO READ Watch | Delhi Chalo march | Why are farmers protesting again?\n\nMaharashtra, the largest sugarcane cultivator, was hit by mass protests by farmers' organisation Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS), which demanded an additional Rs 40 per quintal for the sugarcane crushed in the previous season and an FRP of Rs 350 per quintal for the 2023-24 season. However, the state government refused to intervene, only holding talks between the SSS and mill owners.\n\nTackling the issue at the national level, several sugarcane farmers have joined the farm unions' 'Chalo Dilli' call, seeking higher FRP. Farmers from Karnataka State Sugarcane Cultivators Association have joined the protests headed by Samyukta Kisan Morcha seeking FRP to be hiked to \u20b9400 per quintal. Similarly, sugarcane farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana have joined the Delhi protests, seeking clearance of dues from state-owned sugar mills.\n\nHow will the FRP hike affect farmers' protest?\n\nThe farmer unions marching towards Delhi mainly hail from Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The Centre's decision to hike the sugarcane FRP has been termed as a 'political move' targeting two of the largest States, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh amounting to 80 and 48 Lok Sabha seats respectively, than a realistic one. Currently, Punjab has has an SAP of \u20b9391/quintal for sugarcane for the October season, while Uttar Pradesh offers \u20b9370/quintal and Haryana offers \u20b9386/quintal. All these State Advised Prices are higher than the FRP offered by the Centre of \u20b9340/quintal at 10.25% recovery.\n\nTractors and trolleys of the protesting farmers parked on a highway during their protest over various demands, including a legal guarantee of minimum support price (MSP) for crops, at the Punjab-Haryana Shambhu Border, in Patiala district. | Photo Credit: PTI\n\nMoreover, the bigger issue for which sugarcane farmers are protesting is clearance of dues to the tune of crores of rupees by state-owned sugar mills. Several sugar mills have been shut down due to increased fuel costs, lack of funds, losses due to low MSP and crushing debts. The meagre 8% hike in sugarcane FRP is unlikely to dent the protests as the major issues still remain unsolved.",

        "text": "In his speech, he said that the BJP government has been instrumental in revitalising the teachings of Sant Ravidas as they embody a movement to reclaim history, give voice to underrepresented groups, and change the way politics is framed. The BJP has been successful in transforming the social and cultural reality of the country. The current political dispensation's policies have been centred around the empowerment of marginalised people. With this approach, the BJP government is attempting to harmonise some facets of its governance model with that of Begumpura, the city without sorrow envisioned by the poet-saint, through the prioritisation of social justice, equality, and development.\n\nPM Modi, with the motto \"Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayaas\", has not only worked to empower those who have endured centuries of social and economic marginalisation but has also called for a people-centric movement to bring an end to evil of caste in Indian society. Modi's resolve to bring this vision to life has strong undertones of the Ravidasiya concepts of breaking caste hegemony. This can be seen with the consecration of Ram Lalla which was led by PM Modi, who comes from the OBCs, and which included Kashi's Dom Raja, Anil Chaudhary, a Dalit, along with 14 other yajman from across India.\n\nRavidas's ideas of Begumpura and his approach to religion through bhakti have long been a source of inspiration for Dalits. We have found solace in his words, hopes of a tomorrow where marginalisation does not taint our lives. We are now transcending the aspirations of a Begumpura, moving towards Ram Rajya, a society based in equality, justice, peace, harmony, and the eradication of caste- and religion-based divisions. Sant \"Raidass\" or \"Ravidas\" led us to the enlightened world from the darkness of discrimination, breaking the parochial barriers of caste and creed.\n\nBy donning attire forbidden for certain caste communities, Ravidas challenged the caste hegemony. He used to adorn himself with the tilak (sacred red marks made on the forehead), and janeu (sacred thread). He wrapped cloth around his waist, whilst working in his inherited profession leather (chamra), which was considered \"polluted\", and did not give up on the religion he was born into. His struggle was against oppressive ideology, structures, and institutions rather than a particular caste. Based on his unwavering faith in the nirakara (formless) God and inspired by the leatherworking skills of his ancestors, he created an inclusive form of Bhakti. This can be understood as a symbol of resilience and peaceful defiance. His poetry had a mass appeal because of the lucidity and coherence in his language, eschewing exaggeration. His poetry goes beyond aesthetics -- it was a mode of expression reflective of a resilient journey, created in a complex matrix of dynamic psychological, socio-cultural, political, and economic factors; it bears the imprint of the time and space in which it developed. Using clothing and poetry, Ravidas pierced through the divisive politics of caste and played a significant role in forming Dalit consciousness. With his wisdom and articulation, he pushed for samarasta or \"inclusive coexistence\".\n\nRavidas can be seen as a precursor to Ambedkar in his beliefs. Ambedkar, in his paper 'Caste in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development', speaks boldly of the \"Dalit Identity\" -- an identity that should be owned, not hidden. Attached to the idea of \"Harijan\" was the notion of pity; it was as if only redemption at the hands of the upper castes would grant them a life of dignity. Ambedkar defied this perception. His words have inspired younger generations of Dalits in Punjab to create pop songs that underline their \"chamar\" identity, thus linking themselves to both the traditions of Ravidas and Ambedkar. Dalit identities are now seen as symbols of grace, resilience and pride, and not merely reflective of a history of discrimination and subjugation.\n\nOften shut out of mainstream religious and social places, the Dalit community has found comfort and strength in the teachings of figures like Sant Ravidas. The building of a temple dedicated to him represents a symbolic reclamation of areas that have long been linked to the wealthy and privileged segments of society. As our nation matures and progresses towards completely decolonising our consciousness, we are reminded of the preaching of Ravidas who spoke about taking pride in one's heritage and occupation -- to not shy away from the identity that fate has ordained.\n\nIf we truly wish to pay homage to Sant Ravidas, let's work on our everyday language. We must refrain from using caste names as derogatory terms, as these names now reflect our transforming identity -- from being a community asking for pity, to being a community which owns its identity and takes pride in its heritage.",

        "text": "Amul is the inspiration of Atmanirbhar Bharat. Amul products are exported to more than 50 countries around the world. Supported by a vast network of over 18,000 milk cooperative committees and 36,000 farmers, Amul processes more than 3.5 crore litres of milk per day\n\n\"The sapling that was collectively planted by the villages of Gujarat 50 years ago has now grown into a magnificent banyan tree. Today, the branches of this colossal banyan tree have extended across the nation and abroad.\" This is what Prime Minister Narendra Modi said while participating at the Golden Jubilee of Gujarat Coop Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF) recently. GCMMF is the cooperative giant that owns the iconic dairy brand - Amul.\n\nA year before India attained independence, in the heartlands of Gujarat, a revolution was born, which started as a small-scale protest against unfair trade practices of Polson dairy and turned into a monumental movement that reshaped India's dairy landscape. The farmers of Kaira (now Kheda) district formed a cooperative - the Kaira District Co-operative Milk Producers Union Ltd. under the guidance of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.\n\nIn 1965, the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) was set up with the basic objective of replicating the Amul model, which was followed by establishment of GCMMF in 1973, under the leadership of Dr. Verghese Kurien, a.k.a the Milk Man of India. GCMMF emerged as the apex organization of Gujarat's dairy cooperatives, with a mission to provide remunerative returns to farmers and quality products to consumers. The cooperative movement, started in Gujarat became a model not only for India, but for developing countries throughout the world.\n\nIn 1970, the cooperative spearheaded the 'White Revolution', which eventually catapulted India to become the largest producer of milk in the world. The driving force behind the unprecedented growth of India's dairy sector, with a turnover of Rs 10 trillion, is the nation's women workforce. The remarkable success attained by Amul today is largely attributed to this female workforce participation.\n\nAmul is the inspiration of Atmanirbhar Bharat. Amul products are exported to more than 50 countries around the world. Supported by a vast network of over 18,000 milk cooperative committees and 36,000 farmers, Amul processes more than 3.5 crore litres of milk per day.\n\nAt the core of this model lies a three-tier cooperative structure. Village-level dairy societies collect milk from local farmers. These societies, in turn, supply the milk to district-level milk unions. Finally, the state-level milk federations consolidate the supply and distribute it to various markets. Farmers are offered fair prices for their milk, and consumers receive fresh, unadulterated products. By decentralizing operations and involving local communities, Amul not only ensures a steady supply chain but also strengthens rural economies.\n\nToday, Amul is the largest FMCG brand in India posting annual sales turnover of Rs 72,000 crore during FY 2022-23. The UK-based Brand Finance in its 'Brand Finance Food & Drinks Report 2023' has ranked Amul as not only the world's strongest dairy brand globally, but also the second strongest food brand worldwide, only behind American chocolate brand Hershey's.\n\nAt the heart of Amul marketing strategy is the umbrella approach, where the Amul Girl serves as a unifying thread. By using a consistent nomenclature across its product range, Amul has simplified marketing efforts and streamlined cost management.\n\nAlso of great significance is Amul's communication strategy. Introduced in 1966 by Sylvester daCunha, the Amul moppet's witty, relatable advertisements have transcended generations, earning a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for the longest-running campaign. The butter girl was so appreciated that a British company launched a butter and named it Utterly Butterly in 2019. The witty billboards and print ads featuring the Amul Girl, commenting on everything from politics to pop culture, have been successful in keeping the brand alive in public discourse.\n\nAs GCMMF celebrates its golden jubilee, it's not just a milestone for the organization but a triumph for millions of dairy farmers whose lives have been transformed for better. The journey of Amul is truly a great example of balance between cooperatives and government, showcasing what can be achieved when communities come together with a shared purpose. The government is making record investments in modernizing infrastructure related to animal husbandry, with a special fund of Rs 30,000 crore established for this purpose.\n\nToday, Amul brand is not only a product, but also a movement. It is in one way, the representation of the economic freedom of farmers. It has given farmers the courage to dream. To hope. To live.",

        "text": "In an interview with Times Now, it was stated by political strategist Prashant Kishor that the likelihood of BJP securing 370 seats alone in the upcoming 2024 Lok Sabha election is very slim.\n\nIt was mentioned by Prashant Kishor that he would be greatly surprised if BJP manages to secure 370 Lok Sabha seats alone, considering the current circumstances where the possibility is minimal.\n\nPrashant Kishor's Take on BJP in 2024 Elections\n\n\"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has referred to this number in Parliament. However, I believe this is merely a goal for BJP workers, rather than a realistic possibility,\" expressed Prashant Kishor, giving his prediction for the forthcoming election.\n\nThe figure 370 was first brought up by Narendra Modi in Parliament regarding Article 370, which was scrapped by his government during his second term, with the assertion that BJP would secure 370 seats alone and NDA would surpass 400. Subsequently, PM Modi reiterated the target of 370 seats in numerous rallies he addressed, as reported by Hindustan Times, citing a Times Now interview.\n\n\"It is anticipated that BJP may perform notably well in Bengal. In Tamil Nadu, BJP may potentially achieve double-digit representation for the first time. Similarly, BJP is expected to make significant strides in Telangana,\" remarked Prashant Kishor. Prashant Kishor further expressed, \"Issues like Sandeshkhali are likely to tarnish the ruling party's image, as reported by Times Now.\n\nHowever, irrespective of Sandeshkhali, the BJP's influence is on the rise in Bengal. The 2024 election outcome in Bengal will likely catch many in Delhi off guard, who perceive BJP's prospects in Bengal as bleak.\" Regarding the possibility of a third term for PM Modi, Prashant Kishor conveyed that if BJP emerges victorious in the 2024 election, the continued erosion of democratic institutions is inevitable, though not exclusive to BJP.\n\nPrashant Kishor drew parallels with the era of Indira Gandhi, emphasizing that whenever an individual or a group consolidates significant power, it undermines the democratic fabric of society. While India may not transition into a regime akin to China, signs of autocratic governance may become more pronounced. Prashant Kishor highlighted that there are currently 15 states governed by the opposition, reported Times Now.\n\nReflecting on the performance of the INDIA bloc, Prashant Kishor remarked that it commenced its activities late and should have undertaken efforts similar to the present ones last year. \"Last year, the INDIA bloc did not persist beyond 7-10 days. If Rahul Gandhi could spend 7 days in Europe, why didn't the bloc operate for at least that duration last year,\" questioned Prashant Kishor, underscoring the need for the INDIA bloc to extend its vision beyond the 2024 election.",

        "text": "Speaking to reporters, Bhattacharya said, \"I have no information regarding this (meeting between Congress and TIPRA Motha for alliance). I have come to know about this through the media. This is not a big challenge for us. As a party, we are ready\".\n\nBhattacharya also claimed the BJP is ready to fight the 2024 Lok Sabha election on its own based on the work done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for Tripura's development and the performance of the state's \"double engine government\". \"The BJP's party organisation is ready to fight and to win in both Lok Sabha seats of Tripura with the performance of the government to speak for it. We shall gift these two seats to PM Modi\".\n\nAsked if he feels the Congress-CPIM alliance and the ongoing talks between the Congress and TIPRA Motha would create pressure on the saffron party's poll prospects, Bhattacharya said, \"We aren't under any pressure. There were alliances, equations and such in the Assembly elections last year as well but people gave their spontaneous support for the BJP in the polls. We contested byelections in two Assembly seats last year (after the Assembly elections) and single-handedly won against all alliances. So, this isn't an issue for us\".\n\nOn whether the BJP is involved in dialogue with TIPRA Motha, Bhattacharya dodged the question and said, \"This question can be replied to by those in the higher authority\".\n\nTIPRA Motha, which is the main Opposition party in the Tripura Assembly, has been involved in a series of dialogues with the BJP-led Centre over its demand for a Greater Tipraland state for tribals and direct funding to the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) among other issues.\n\nAfter one such meeting was inconclusive in New Delhi earlier this month, the TIPRA Motha leaders declined to comment but met with the Congress party, which was said to be the first round of dialogue for forging a larger opposition unity against the BJP for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.\n\nSoon after, royal scion-turned-politician Pradyot Kishore Manikya Debbarma said he would stage a fast-unto-death protest at Hatai Kotor from February 28 if the Centre doesn't come up with a decision about the demands put forth by his party.\n\nOn Sunday, Pradyot appealed to his supporters to remain united and also called on tribal people from all political grounds to support his movement. \"If the Government of India is serious, if you want Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas, you can't do it by ignoring 30 per cent of the population and 70 per cent of the geographical area. If you are serious, talk to us. If not, we shall find our way. But the community should get something...The Tiprasa community was always sidelined and development wasn't given to us. I was saddened to see 27,000 people apply for 110 jobs in the TTAADC sub-zonal posts. There is so much unemployment. If we stay poor, our children can't get education\".\n\nHe also said the state government is earning money through the Neermahal, Ujjayanta Palace, Tripurasundari Temple etc, built by the erstwhile kings of Tripura and said the Tripura ADC should get a share of the money for its development as well.\n\nPradyot also said the Tripura ADC houses 30 per cent of the population but receives only 2 per cent of the state budget. Terming the system as \"injustice\", he said, \"We want our constitutional rights. If someone is serious, they can talk. But if they want to do politics alone, thank you very much but I am not interested\".\n\nHe also said Motha has placed its demands and the ball is in the Centre's court. \"If they give it, we shall go. If they don't give, shall fight alone. But the community will get something in writing this time. We shall consider 100 per cent if they propose some solution\".",

If everything was to be done only for one family then how would one remember to build the country? Its (Congress) entire energy was focused on how to run the government for five years and how to hide scams,\" Modi said.\n\nThe Congress could make India's economy only the 11th largest because the party did not have the capacity to fulfil big dreams of the people of a vast nation, Modi said.\n\nHis government's commitment to put an end to all scams has resulted in the country's progress and the creation of grand infrastructure like the longest cable-stayed bridge connecting Beyt Okha and mainland Okha, the PM pointed out.\n\n\"Sudarshan Setu\" boasts of a unique design, featuring a footpath adorned with verses from Srimad Bhagavad Gita and images of Lord Krishna on both sides.\n\nOn the 'Sudarshan Setu', the PM said he laid the foundation stone for this bridge six years ago and inaugurated it today.\n\n\"This is Modi's guarantee,\" he added.\n\nWhen the economy was small, it did not have the capacity to fulfil huge dreams of a vast nation, he said, adding that whatever little budget was earmarked for infrastructure was looted by way of scams.\n\nWhen the time came to improve telecom infrastructure, the Congress created the 2G scam and when it was time to strengthen sports infrastructure, the Congress created the Commonwealth scam, the PM said.\n\nWhen it was the time to strengthen the defence infrastructure, the Congress indulged in the helicopter and submarine scam, he added\n\n\"The Congress can only betray every need of the country. In 2014, when you all blessed me and sent me to Delhi, I had promised you all I will not let the country be looted. Scams worth several thousands of crores that used to happen during the Congress era have all been stopped,\" he asserted.\n\nIn the last 10 years, his government has made the country's economy the fifth largest in the world, and as a result such grand and divine constructions are taking place all over, which was creating \"the new picture of new India\", he said.\n\nThe sea bridge (Atal Setu) in Mumbai, the (railway) bridge on Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir, the under construction vertical lift bridge in Tamil Nadu and a river bridge in Assam are examples of such mega projects, he pointed out.\n\nThe PM said he was fortunate to get a chance to inaugurate the bridge, the foundation stone of which he had laid six years ago.\n\n\"The bridge will connect Beyt Dwarka island to Okha mainland and add to the beauty of the place. Whatever was dreamed of, and whose foundation stone was laid was fulfilled. This is the guarantee of Modi, a servant of the public,\" he asserted.\n\nThe 'Sudarshan Setu' is not just another bridge but an engineering marvel that will reduce dependency of tourists and pilgrims on ferry boats.\n\n\"Modern connectivity is a way to build a prosperous and strong nation,\" the PM reiterated.\n\nAs chief minister of Gujarat, he had placed the idea of such a bridge in front of the (Congress-ruled) Centre several times but the latter never paid attention to it, Modi said.\n\nAsserting that several tourist and pilgrimage spots in Gujarat had been improved leading to these become favoured places for international tourists, he asked people to ensure cleanliness of Dwarka for tourists.\n\nOut of 85 lakh tourists who visited India, a fifth visited Gujarat.\n\n\"Till August last year, 15.5 lakh tourists visited Gujarat.

The announcement to increase the defence budget to Rs 6.21 lakh crore has been made, which is more than 13% of the total budget. The government now neither has a shortage of funds nor lack of intention. Along with deepening challenges on the borders and changing dynamics of the geo-political landscape, the defence budget has been increased. This step reflects the long-term vision of the Indian government,\" Singh said at the summit.\n\nThe minister said that the goal of the government is to manufacture high-end aero engines and gas turbines. \"Our goal is to manufacture high-end systems such as aero-engines and gas turbines in India within the next five years. Now, this goal is not an ordinary one. And why should it be? When the capability and dedication of the youth of this country are extraordinary, when the intention of the government of this country is crystal clear, then there is no question of setting ordinary goals. In the coming five years, we will embark on an exciting journey towards extraordinary goals,\" the minister said.\n\nWhile talking about indigenous weapons, Singh said, \"If you look at the defence manufacturing sector, when we prepared the positive indigenous list of weapons and moved forward with the aim that products made in India would be in the hands of Indian soldiers, some people raised the question that the products made here would not be world-class. Although I completely disagree with their views, I would like to say to them that if we don't give our manufacturers a chance, how will they improve the quality of their products? Initially, we faced some difficulties, short-term pain occurred, but instead of focusing on this short-term pain, we paid attention to the long-term gain for the country's military strength and defence sector's self-reliance.\"\n\nHe said that the PM Narendra Modi-led government doesn't focus on short-term pain or gain, but the focus remains long-term gain. \"When you carefully evaluate the changes in the defence sector under the leadership of the Prime Minister, considering the long-term gain, you will also see many remarkable things. You will see how radically we have changed India's defence sector in the past few years. Inspired by the Prime Minister's vision, we have worked towards making India self-reliant in the defence industrial sector,\" he said.\n\nHe said that this is the first government which dared to impose a ban on imports of weapons to become self-reliant. \"We are the first government to impose a ban on the import of weapons. Just imagine how painful it is in the short term for any nation to impose a ban on the import of some weapons to advance towards self-reliance. It was difficult for us in the short term, but this challenge is gradually turning into an opportunity, and India's sun is rising on the global defence industrial stage. India's defence industrial sector has now taken significant steps towards self-reliance at a rapid pace. The weapons coming into the hands of our soldiers are being made on our country's soil and by the hands of our citizens,\" he said.\n\n\"Our armed forces have issued five positive indigenisation lists, identifying 509 systems and equipment, the manufacturing of which will now be on Indian soil. Additionally, we have also issued four positive indigenisation lists for Defense Public Sector Undertakings, identifying 4,666 systems and line replacement units, the production of which will be in our country and by our citizens,\" he said.\n\n\"Inspired by the Prime Minister, our government has stepped out of this comfort zone and made plans to elevate India to the list of exporters in the defense industrial sector. And today, you can see that we have succeeded in our efforts, which can be understood from this figure: the annual export of defence equipment, which did not even reach a total of a Rs 1,000 crore 7-8 years ago, has now reached approximately Rs 16,000 crore. We were once the largest arms importer in the world, but today we are in the list of top 25 arms exporters,\" Singh said.",

        "text": "\"The Congress never paid attention to Sudarshan Setu, its construction was written by Lord Krishna in my fate,\" said PM Modi after inaugurating India's longest cable-stayed bridge, Sudarshan Setu, in Gujarat's Dwarka on Sunday.\n\nThe 2.32 km long cable-stayed bridge connects Beyt Dwarka island to mainland Okha in Gujarat's Devbhumi Dwarka district.

Here are the top ten updates on PM Modi's visit to Gujarat.\n\n-PM Modi began his two-day visit to Gujarat on Saturday. On the second day of his Gujarat visit, PM Modi started the day by offering prayers at Lord Sri Krishna temple at Beyt Dwarka.\n\n-Associated with a rich legacy of Lord Krishna, Dwarka city is believed to be submerged underwater. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday offered prayers at the underwater site where the ancient city of Dwarka once existed in past.\n\n-Later, he inaugurated the four-lane cable-stayed bridge called the 'Sudarshan Setu'. The unique design of the bridge along with a featuring footpath adorned with verses from Srimad Bhagavad Gita and images of Lord Krishna on both sides.\n\n-After the inauguration of the bridge, PM Modi said, \"When I was the CM, the locals used to speak to me about a bridge, I used to present this in front of the then Congress government, but they never paid attention to this.

When I used to say that waters of rivers that have water for the whole year, would be brought to Saurashtra and Kutch, Congress ridiculed me. But today, Sauni (Saurashtra Narmada Avtaran Irrigation) Yojana has changed the fate of Saurashtra. More than 1300 km of pipeline has been spread, which is wide enough to pass a car through it,\" said PM Modi.\n\n-While addressing an event in Dwarka, PM Modi also mentioned women of the Ahir community. Referring to a community dance performed by more than 37,000 Ahir women, PM Modi said, \"People met me, asked how was this happening in sync.

That's why they could make India only the 11th largest economy in the world in their 10 years. The budget, which used to be for infrastructure, was looted through scams. Congress did the 2G scam, a Commonwealth scam, a helicopter scam, and a submarine scam. Congress has only betrayed every need of the country,\" the PM added.\n\nComing down heavily on the opposition, the PM said that they are witnessing the formation of the New India, which idea was 'ridiculed' by them.\n\n\"When I gave the guarantee of the making of the New India, the opposition, which is fond of abusing me, ridiculed that.

        "text": "The results come before India goes to the polls in an election to be held by May, with Modi seeking a rare third term. (Image credit: )\n\nIndians are spending less on food, particularly staples like rice and wheat, and more on discretionary items such as processed food, as well as durables like televisions and fridges, government consumption data showed. The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey, released late on Saturday, estimates average rural consumer spending rose to 3,773 rupees ($45.54) a month per person for the 12 months through July from 1,430 rupees in the previous survey in 2011-2012, while urban spending rose to 6,459 rupees ($77.95) from 2,630 rupees.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government did not release a 2017-2018 survey due to what it called \"data quality issues\". The decision prompted controversy over whether the administration was concealing economic data.\n\nThe government denied suggestions it was withholding the data because they showed weak consumption trends. The new survey will form the basis of a review of India's consumer price inflation index.\n\nSpending on food fell to 46 per cent of monthly consumption for rural consumers from nearly 53 per cent in 2011-12, while in urban areas it fell to 39 per cent from 43 per cent. Indians are spending less on cereals, including wheat and rice, and pulses, but more on beverages, refreshments and processed food. Among non-food items, consumers are spending more on conveyance, consumer services and durable goods, like televisions and fridges.\n\nThe results come before India goes to the polls in an election to be held by May, with Modi seeking a rare third term. While the Indian economy is forecast to grow at a world-beating 7.3 per cent in the fiscal year that started in April and 7 per cent next fiscal year, large parts of the population living in rural areas face stagnant incomes and high inflation.",

They will also likely find Google Maps not working as internet access has been restricted across huge swathes of the state.\n\nAfter a nearly 50-km detour through rural Punjab, my taxi driver managed to get us to the tail end of the caravan of tractors, trolleys and tents stretching for 10 km from the Shambhu border.\n\nA group of farmers sitting on a mattress beneath the shade of their tractor brought back to memory the very first group of protesting farmers I ever met, at Delhi's Ghazipur border on a cold, smoggy December evening in 2020. They too had been sitting on a mattress by the side of the Meerut Express Highway. I still remember the very first question those Sikh farmers had asked me as I had approached them. \"Have you had something to eat?\" Certainly not the kind of question 'terrorists' ask.\n\nI asked this current group of farmers to explain their protest in terms simple enough for a non-farmer to understand.\n\nAmrit Singh, who farms a three-acre plot of land outside Amritsar, obliged.\n\n\"The issue of minimum support price is not just the farmers' issue, it is something that concerns everyone in India, because everyone needs to eat! MSP simply means a fair price below which we should not have to sell our produce. While there is MSP for wheat and rice, there is no MSP for tomatoes, onions and other fruit and vegetables. That's why we end up selling our produce for two or three rupees a kilo, but you end up buying it for 80, 100, or even 150 rupees a kilo!\"\n\nHe went on to explain, \"The manufacturer who made the shirt I am wearing fixed a price he wanted to sell it at. But we farmers get to have no say in how much we will sell our crops for! We are simply asking for what the government has already been promised to us, and we are being called khalistanis by the media! Please take your camera, walk around, and see for yourself if there are any terrorists present! Do we look like terrorists to you?\"\n\nAmit Singh continued, \"If there is a problem at home, don't we take our problems to the head of the house? Similarly, shouldn't we be able to go to the highest authorities in the land if we have a problem? But what happens when we do? We end up getting beaten, teargassed, and shot, and then we end up being called the enemy! More and more we are being made to feel like outsiders in our own country. To tell you the truth, our hearts are crying.\"\n\nAn elderly farmer who had been overhearing the conversation interrupted. \"Look at all these farmers here! None of them are rich. Some own two acres of land, some three. Many of them barely manage to grow enough to feed even their own families! And yet, these are the people who are being bombed and shot! Modi should be ashamed of himself! Instead of interviewing us, why don't you interview Modi and ask him what he is doing?!\"\n\nThe anger in his voice rising, the elderly man pointed to the other elderly farmers sitting there. \"My knees are damaged, this farmer's legs hurt, this other farmer here can barely walk! None of us are sitting here because we are happy to, you know?\"\n\nI crossed hundreds of tractors and trolleys as I walked towards the bridge across Ghaggar river which has now become the de facto border between the paramilitary and the farmers. Every 50 feet or so, someone had set up a langar and was serving tea, food or water. An elderly gentleman in the back of a tempo offered water bottles and kinoos to everyone who passed by.\n\nAbout 100 meters from the paramilitary barricade, a group of farmers stood guard next to a thick rope that had cordoned off a hundred-meter stretch of empty road now considered \"no man's land\". The farmers have been instructed not to go beyond that rope. Strewn all over the road were gunny sacks which the farmers had thrown on exploding tear gas canisters to try and contain the smoke.\n\nBarely 300 metres from the border, a group called the United Sikhs had set up a medical camp for those injured in the recent tear gas shelling. They showed me huge rubber bullets and exploded tear gas cannisters and told me that military grade weapons were used on the farmers. They also told me that a tear gas cannister fired from a drone exploded right next to their tent.\n\n\"Elderly people have inhaled tear gas, and it has damaged their lungs. We have removed pellets from the bodies of the injured. Please go to Rajpura hospital and see the condition of the injured for yourself. What has happened here is very, very wrong!'\n\nA short distance away, Dr Harpreet Singh and Dr Ravinder Singh, two young doctors from Hoshiarpur were distributing medicines from the boot of their car. Mentioning their proximity to 'ground zero', I asked if they were afraid of getting injured in police and paramilitary action.\n\nDr Harpreet smiled, shook his head, and said, \"When we came here, sar pe kafan bandh ke aye thhe. We came with the full awareness that we too could get injured or killed. But we are not afraid. We are here to fight for our rights. Our Guru Gobind Singh Ji Maharaj has taught us that just as it is a sin to commit wrongdoing, it is also a sin to tolerate it.\"\n\nI shook their hands and told them I admired their courage and selflessness.\n\nManinder Singh, a homemaker, told me she comes every morning to do seva and serve langar to the protestors, and then goes back home in the evening. She also made it a point to tell me, \"Our Guru Nanak Dev ji has not made us cowards.\"\n\nLakhvir Singh, a farmer from Sri Muktsar Sahib said, \"Give us MSP for all 23 crops and we will diversify our crop cultivation and grow the crops that will neither deplete the water table nor compel us to burn parali (stubble) and pollute the air. We are not just fighting for ourselves, we are fighting for the rights of farmers all over India. Farmers in Bihar are selling their rice for Rs 1,300 a quintal whereas MSP for rice is Rs 2,200. We care about them too. Give us MSP based on Dr [M.S.] Swaminathan's C2+50% formula and we will go home. We aren't mad to want to sit here on the road...\"\n\nThe farmers did not conceal their pain at being attacked by \"their own sons on the other side of the barricading\". While the quiet tenacity and courage of the farmers continues to be inspiring, it is deeply alarming is to see the massive deficit of trust that the government's heavy-handedness and lack of empathy has created not just between the kisan and the sarkaar, but also between the kisan and the jawaan.\n\nAn elderly farmer who did not wish to be named perhaps expressed the tragedy of the situation best when he said, \"We will forgive those who have hurt us, for they were acting under orders, and we will continue to feed you for that is what we do, but we will never, ever forget the vishvaasghaat (betrayal) that has been has done to us.\"",

The Narendra Modi government has been criticised for not collecting and sharing proper data on the economy.\n\nThe latest report showed that although the average MPCE in urban households rose to Rs 3,510 - an increase by 33.5% since 2011-12 - and rural households to Rs 2008 that is a 40-42% uptick, the jump is more owing to steep inflationary trends than any real rise in incomes.\n\nThe trend is proven by the fact that the survey also revealed that the proportion of spending on food slid to 46.4% from 52.9% in 2011-12 in rural households, while it dropped from 42.6% to 39.2% in the corresponding period for urban households. The figure could imply that people may be cutting down on spending on food because of high retail inflation, or have been relieved by the government's free ration scheme to 80 crore Indians.\n\nThe MPCE figures are based on data collected from 2,61,746 households, of which 1,55,014 were in rural areas, spread over all States and Union Territories.\n\n\"The MPCE numbers cited above do not take into account the imputed values of items received free of cost by individuals through various social welfare programmes such as the PM Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana (PMGKAY) or State-run schemes, which were calculated separately, while including a few non-food items received through such schemes, including computers, mobile phones, bicycles, and clothing,\" The Hindu reported.\n\n\"The average MPCE, at 2011-12 prices, was a tad higher when these items were included while excluding free education and healthcare sops -- at \u20b92,054 for rural households, and \u20b93,544 for urban homes,\" it added.\n\nSikkim's MPCE is the highest among Indian states at Rs 7,731 in rural and Rs 12, 105 in urban households. Chhattisgarh was at the bottom of the ladder where the MPCE is Rs 2,466 for rural and Rs 4,483 for urban households.",

        "text": "Gangtok (Sikkim) [India], February 25 (ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi will lay the foundation stone for Sikkim's first railway station, Rangpo Station, on February 26, said Deputy Railway Manager of Alipurduar.\n\nPM Modi will lay the foundation for almost 550 Amrit railway stations on February 26.\n\nAmarjeet Agrawal, the DRM, said, \"Rangpo station is the form of a touristic and defensive point of view for Sikkim and India, Basically, Sikkim did not have a railway line earlier. The government has signed this project in three phases. In the first phase, Sevoke to the Rangpo rail project; in the other phase, from Rangpo to Gangtok; and the third phase, from Gangtok to Nathula\".\n\n\"This is the third mode of connectivity for the people of Sikkim, So far, people are travelling here by Road and airway. This project has to be completed till 2024 but due to some external factors like floods and landslides, the completion period has been extended till 2025,\" the DRM Alipurduar added\n\n\"Sevoke is the alignment of the Assam link project. This is 26 km away from Siliguri railway station. After this project, we are upgrading the Sevoke station. The Sevoke-Rangpo project is a 45-kilometer-long rail project. Out of forty-five km, three and a half km is part of Sikkim state and forty-one and a half km is part of West Bengal,\" said project director Mohinder Singh.\n\nThe project director also added, \"This project has fourteen tunnels and thirteen major bridges, and nine minor bridges. Completion of the project has done sixty to sixty-five per cent, from next month we will initiate track work.\".\n\n\"Eighty-six per cent of the alignment of this project is in the tunnel, and digging out of the tunnel is challenging work; it's not easy to dig, because rocks are not too strong. In a month, we dig fifteen metres,\" says the Project director\n\nThe project director said, \"Teesta Bazar station could be an underground railway station. This comes between the Sevoke to Rangpo rail projects. The length of the platform of this station is six hundred and twenty metres, on which we could stand a full-length train, we have six excess tunnel for emergency purposes to evacuation.\n\n\"In the Indian Railway, especially in broad gauge, this is the first underground railway station. This station is Very relevant, because, Teesta bazar connects Darjning to Gangtok so it could be convenient for the passengers who want to go to Draining or Gangtok\", the Project director added.

        "text": "Asked about the speculation and rumours doing the rounds that he may switch to the BJP, the Congress MP said, \"I do not dignify rumours with a response.\"\n\nHe said posting of his recent speech in Parliament on social media amid the speculation \"speaks for itself\".\n\nTewari had launched a scathing attack on the Modi government's economic performance during the Budget session of Parliament earlier this month.\n\nOn the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) finally getting its act together and recently sealing seat-sharing deals with the AAP and the Samajwadi Party, Tewari said elections have not been announced as yet and so time is not a constraint.\n\nOn whether the I.N.D.I.A. bloc was late off the blocks with the BJP aggressively working on a poll strategy, the former Union minister said ultimately people have to assess the incumbent government on 10 years of its performance and, therefore, that is the litmus test of this election.\n\n\"It is the people who have to vote. Until elections are announced, there is a time and a place and a moment for doing everything,\" he asserted.\n\nHitting back at critics calling the Congress-AAP alliance \"unnatural\", Tewari pointed out that the BJP and the PDP were in an alliance in Jammu and Kashmir before the BJP decided to \"dismember\" the state and convert it into two Union territories and \"throw the PDP leadership into jail\".\n\n\"So, I am pleasantly surprised when the word 'unnatural alliances' is used,\" he said.\n\nWith the Congress and the AAP not joining hands in Punjab, Tewari said politics is the preponderance of probabilities.\n\n\"Obviously you do not expect the ruling establishment and the principal opposition party in a state to come together (in Punjab). There are different models for every state. In Kerala we (the Congress and the Left) have been cooperating at the Centre and fighting at the state level for a very long time,\" he said.\n\nAsked how the Congress was placed in Punjab and if it would increase its tally from the last Lok Sabha polls, Tewari said the party is \"very well placed\".\n\nOn the BJP and others' contention of 'Narendra Modi versus who' in the polls and what would be I.N.D.I.A. bloc's response to it, he said, \"We are a parliamentary democracy and not a presidential form of government. It is the MPs who should decide at the culmination of a poll as to who their leader would be and should be.\"\n\nOn Prime Minister Modi and the BJP's claim that the party will get 370 seats and the NDA will get more than 400, Tewari said, \"Hubris and arrogance are the worst enemy of any individual or political party.\"\n\nExpressing confidence that seat-sharing deals will further be struck in the future to strengthen the I.N.D.I.A. bloc, Tewari said alliances are work in progress. \"So, therefore, obviously till the time things don't fructify, any comment would be premature. But as I said politics is the preponderance of probabilities and is a work in progress,\" he said.\n\nOn whether the Ram temple inauguration in Ayodhya will prove to be an important poll issue, the Congress leader said politics is politics and religion is religion.\n\n\"Therefore, if you mix the two it has very deleterious consequences on the health of any polity. My faith is my faith. I have respect and reverence for Lord Ram and the temple which has been built in Ayodhya but I am surprised that why won't an incumbent government ask for votes on its 10 years of track record,\" Tewari said, taking a swipe at the BJP.\n\nHe said the key issues for the Lok Sabha polls are preservation of democracy, inflation and unemployment.\n\nAsked about the bread and butter issues raised by the opposition not working in some of the recent assembly polls, Tewari said ultimately any election should be fought on real issues and these are the main issues on the ground.\n\n\"Preservation of democracy, safeguarding the sanctity of the Constitution, ensuring the autonomy of institutions, ensuring that young people get livelihoods, ensuring that inflation does not become a millstone around the neck of housewives, these are the issues,\" he said.\n\nTewari also hit back at Prime Minister Modi for his attack on the opposition over the issue of corruption, saying it is like raising a ghost and slaying it.\n\n\"But there comes a point in time when raising the same ghost and slaying it either does not fetch you any electoral dividends or is a factor of diminishing returns. If you continue to harp on a non-existent bogey it means you have nothing of a track record to show,\" he said, attacking the BJP.\n\n\"After all you are an incumbent government, you should be asking for votes on the strength of your performance over the past 10 years,\" he said.\n\nAsked if the I.N.D.I.A. bloc was looking for a 2004 repeat when the Congress had beaten the BJP's shining India campaign and analysts claiming that 2024 is a foregone conclusion, Tewari said it is the people of India who have to decide not some armchair analysts, especially those who are more like desk stenographers, rather than objective analysts.\n\n\"As I said I am not an astrologer and I can see the pain and misery on the ground. People have to assess the track record of this government over the past 10 years and when you see pain and misery on the ground, I think the conclusions are obvious,\" he said.",

That means this 18th Lok Sabha will also be a symbol of youth aspiration\" he added.\n\nHe also urged the country's influencers, regardless of whether they are from the sports world, film industry, literature world, other professionals or Instagram or YouTubers, to actively participate in this campaign and motivate first time voters.\n\nThe PM noted that the atmosphere of Lok Sabha elections is all pervasive in the country and as happened last time, there is a possibility that the code of conduct might also be in place in March.\n\nHe said Mann Ki Baat' will not be broadcast for the next three months in these days of Lok Sabha elections.\n\n\"Next when we will interact with you in 'Mann Ki Baat', it will be the 111th episode of 'Mann Ki Baat'. Next time 'Mann Ki Baat' starts with the auspicious number 111\" he added.",

Even as negotiations between farmer unions and government have been underway, protests have sometimes turned violent.\n\nOn several occasions, scores of farmers have suffered injuries trying to force their way through concrete blocks and barbed wires installed by police to prevent them from marching on the capital. Some police officials were also injured in these sporadic clashes.\n\n\"Our determination to bring about the change helps face the police every day,\" said Mathada, who is studying for a degree in Arts. Mathada and his father have been using swimming goggles and a metal shield to protect themselves from thick clouds of smoke and tear gas shells lobbed via drones by the police.\n\n\"It has been a shocking experience to see how the police can use force to stop farmers from marching towards Delhi...it has shown me how democracy can fade so quickly,\" said Mathada. Before the protests, Mathada helped his family cultivate crops on their ancestral land and manage a hardware shop.\n\n\"For now, the main occupation is to make sure Modi government accepts our demands,\" he said, adding that attending college lectures has become secondary for him and some of his classmates. The protests come just months before elections in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party is seeking a third consecutive term.\n\nLast week, Modi said his government is committed to the welfare of farmers and is on a mission to make them entrepreneurs and exporters. Mathada will be eligible to vote for the first time but is having doubts.\n\n\"I think about democracy and feel a bit disillusioned; I may not even cast my vote this time.\"\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Calling Congress leader Rahul Gandhi a \"dynast\", the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha President said he is something today, only because of the fact that he has inherited his parents and family's monetary as well as political legacy.\n\n\"A dynast like Rahul Gandhi, can only view the country's economy from the lens of entitlement, from the lens of dynasty.\n\nWhat has happened over the last ten years is that the Prime Minister has not only waged a war against a dynasty in politics but he has also democratised the country's economic space in the last ten years, thanks to the multi-dimensional effort the government has made to formalise the country's economy,\" Surya told PTI video.\n\nHe was responding to a question on the Congress' narrative that the Modi government is in the hands of a few crony capitalists. Pointing out that today one can find first generation billionaires in India who do not inherit a business legacy, he further said, \"But for Rahul Gandhi, who is something today only because of the fact that he has inherited his parents and family's monetary as well as political legacy, he is not ready to acknowledge and recognise the democratisation of the country's economy.\"\n\nThe first generation millionaires and billionaires coming up in India are higher than any time in the past seventy years, Surya said as he questioned \"How can you make this absurd allegation that this country and the country's government is supporting one or two generational entrepreneurs?\" \"How can one accuse this government of crony capitalism when it is empowering, encouraging young people with strong dreams, who are hardworking, and have the ability to go and build unicorns,\" he asked, while noting that India has positioned itself as a very strong entity in geopolitics.\n\nHighlighting that the Prime Minister has on multiple occasions made it very clear that the third term of the Modi government is the most important term insofar as laying the foundation for a \"Viksit Bharat\" is concerned, the MP said, the next five years are going to be a multi-dimensional transformation at a much faster pace and a more accelerated pace than what we have seen the last five years of the Prime Minister. Do not be surprised if Karnataka gives a clean sweep to the BJP, to Narendra Modi in the general elections, he further said, as he accused the Siddaramaiah-led Congress government in the state of corruption and being bankrupt. Summing up his journey in the last five years as an MP from Bangalore South, Surya said it has been a very big learning experience for him and has made him more humble and more hopeful. \"I know it has given me more energy to contribute much more to the city and to the country,\" he said, as he expressed gratitude to the people of his constituency and the city for giving him this opportunity to serve the city.",

The PM said that the movie would prove to be useful for people to get the correct information. \"I do not know what the film is all about, but yesterday I heard on TV that a film is coming on Article 370. Good, it will be useful for people to get correct information.",

        "text": "Highlighting the devastating results of substance addiction, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday reaffirmed the government's commitment to eradicating substance abuse from the grassroots level.\n\nHe stressed the need for strong family support systems to combat substance abuse effectively. \"Hence, for building a substance-free India, families must be strong as institutions,\" he said.\n\nThe PM was addressing 'Ashwamedha Yagya', organised by the Gayatri Parivar through a video message. He started with his dilemma to get associated with an 'Ashwamedh Yagya' in the light of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections as that could be misinterpreted. However, he said, \"When I saw the Ashwamedha Yagya to uphold the sentiments of Acharya Shri Ram Sharma and infusing it with new meaning, my doubts melted away\"\n\nMr Modi acknowledged the role of Gayatri Parivar's role in steering millions of youth away from addiction and towards nation-building activities. \"Youth are the future of our nation,\" he emphasised, recognising their pivotal role in shaping India's destiny and contributing to its development.\n\nHe also highlighted the imperative to protect the youth from the grip of addiction and provide support to those already affected. \"Addiction wreaks havoc on individuals and societies, causing immense damage,\" the PM underscored, reaffirming the government's commitment to the nationwide initiative for a Drug-Free India launched 3-4 years ago which engaged more than 11 crore people.\n\nThe PM also spoke about the extensive outreach efforts including bike rallies, oath-taking ceremonies, and street plays conducted in collaboration with social and religious organisations.\n\n\"As we integrate our youth with larger national and global initiatives, they will steer clear of small wrongdoings,\" he remarked, highlighting the youth's pivotal role in achieving the goals of a 'Viksit and Aatmanirbhar Bharat'.\n\n\"The theme of the G-20 summit under India's presidency, 'One Earth, One Family, One Future,' exemplifies our shared human values and aspirations,\" the PM stated, underscoring the importance of collective efforts in global initiatives such as 'One sun, one world, one grid' and 'One world, one health.'\n\n\"In such national and global campaigns, the more we involve our youth, the more they will stay away from the wrong path,\" he said.\n\nSpeaking on the government's focus on sports and science, Mr Modi remarked, \"The success of Chandrayaan has sparked a new interest in technology among the youth.\" He emphasised the transformative impact of such initiatives in channeling the energy of the youth in the right direction. He said that initiatives like the Fit India Movement and the Khelo India will motivate the youth and \"a motivated youth cannot turn towards substance abuse.\"",

        "text": "Asked if he would be contesting from Anandpur Sahib, the Congress leader simply said, \"I am the MP from Anandpur Sahib.\" In an interview with PTI, Tewari also said the Congress was \"very well placed\" in Punjab for the general elections.\n\nAsked about the speculation and rumours doing the rounds that he may switch to the BJP, the Congress MP said, \"I do not dignify rumours with a response.\" He said posting of his recent speech in Parliament on social media amid the speculation \"speaks for itself\".\n\nTewari had launched a scathing attack on the Modi government's economic performance during the Budget session of Parliament earlier this month.\n\nOn the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) finally getting its act together and recently sealing seat-sharing deals with the AAP and the Samajwadi Party, Tewari said elections have not been announced as yet and so time is not a constraint.\n\nOn whether the INDIA bloc was late off the blocks with the BJP aggressively working on a poll strategy, the former Union minister said ultimately people have to assess the incumbent government on 10 years of its performance and, therefore, that is the litmus test of this election.\n\n\"It is the people who have to vote. Until elections are announced, there is a time and a place and a moment for doing everything,\" he asserted.\n\nHitting back at critics calling the Congress-AAP alliance \"unnatural\", Tewari pointed out that the BJP and the PDP were in an alliance in Jammu and Kashmir before the BJP decided to \"dismember\" the state and convert it into two Union territories and \"throw the PDP leadership into jail\".\n\n\"So, I am pleasantly surprised when the word 'unnatural alliances' is used,\" he said.\n\nWith the Congress and the AAP not joining hands in Punjab, Tewari said politics is the preponderance of probabilities.\n\n\"Obviously you do not expect the ruling establishment and the principal opposition party in a state to come together (in Punjab). There are different models for every state. In Kerala we (the Congress and the Left) have been cooperating at the Centre and fighting at the state level for a very long time,\" he said.\n\nAsked how the Congress was placed in Punjab and if it would increase its tally from the last Lok Sabha polls, Tewari said the party is \"very well placed\".\n\nOn the BJP and others' contention of 'Narendra Modi versus who' in the polls and what would be INDIA bloc's response to it, he said, \"We are a parliamentary democracy and not a presidential form of government. It is the MPs who should decide at the culmination of a poll as to who their leader would be and should be.\" On Prime Minister Modi and the BJP's claim that the party will get 370 seats and the NDA will get more than 400, Tewari said, \"Hubris and arrogance are the worst enemy of any individual or political party.\" Expressing confidence that seat-sharing deals will further be struck in the future to strengthen the INDIA bloc, Tewari said alliances are work in progress. \"So, therefore, obviously till the time things don't fructify, any comment would be premature. But as I said politics is the preponderance of probabilities and is a work in progress,\" he said.\n\nOn whether the Ram temple inauguration in Ayodhya will prove to be an important poll issue, the Congress leader said politics is politics and religion is religion.\n\n\"Therefore, if you mix the two it has very deleterious consequences on the health of any polity. My faith is my faith. I have respect and reverence for Lord Ram and the temple which has been built in Ayodhya but I am surprised that why won't an incumbent government ask for votes on its 10 years of track record,\" Tewari said, taking a swipe at the BJP.\n\nHe said the key issues for the Lok Sabha polls are preservation of democracy, inflation and unemployment.\n\nAsked about the bread and butter issues raised by the opposition not working in some of the recent assembly polls, Tewari said ultimately any election should be fought on real issues and these are the main issues on the ground.\n\n\"Preservation of democracy, safeguarding the sanctity of the Constitution, ensuring the autonomy of institutions, ensuring that young people get livelihoods, ensuring that inflation does not become a millstone around the neck of housewives, these are the issues,\" he said.\n\nTewari also hit back at Prime Minister Modi for his attack on the opposition over the issue of corruption, saying it is like raising a ghost and slaying it.\n\n\"But there comes a point in time when raising the same ghost and slaying it either does not fetch you any electoral dividends or is a factor of diminishing returns. If you continue to harp on a non-existent bogey it means you have nothing of a track record to show,\" he said, attacking the BJP.\n\n\"After all you are an incumbent government, you should be asking for votes on the strength of your performance over the past 10 years,\" he said.\n\nAsked if the INDIA bloc was looking for a 2004 repeat when the Congress had beaten the BJP's shining India campaign and analysts claiming that 2024 is a foregone conclusion, Tewari said it is the people of India who have to decide not some armchair analysts, especially those who are more like desk stenographers, rather than objective analysts.\n\n\"As I said I am not an astrologer and I can see the pain and misery on the ground. People have to assess the track record of this government over the past 10 years and when you see pain and misery on the ground, I think the conclusions are obvious,\" he said. PTI ASK ANB ANB",

        "text": "The Sudarshan Setu boasts a distinctive design adorned with sacred verses from the Shrimad Bhagwad Gita and teachings of dharma, alongside captivating depictions of Lord Krishna\n\nOn Sunday, 25th February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated Sudarshan Setu, connecting Okha mainland and Beyt Dwarka island, to the nation. The bridge has been built at a cost of around Rs 980 crores. It is the longest cable-stayed bridge in India, with a length of 2.32 kilometres. PM Modi also laid the foundation for multiple development projects in Dwarka. These projects are estimated to see investment of more than Rs 4,150 crores.\n\nThe inauguration of India's longest cable-stayed bridge in India, originally known as 'Signature Bridge', has been renamed as 'Sudarshan Setu'. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fulfilling one of his dream projects, officially opened the bridge on February 25th. Spanning a length of 2.32 km, this bridge connects Okha to Beyt Dwarka and boasts numerous features. It is expected to greatly benefit pilgrims visiting the Dwarkadhish Temple, serving as a significant asset for their journey.\n\nPreviously, pilgrims travelling from Okha to Dwarka relied on boats, exposing them to the dangers of overloaded vessels and risking their lives. Recent incidents in Morbi and Vadodara underscored these risks. The construction of the Sudarshan Setu by the Modi government has alleviated these concerns significantly. Additionally, the lengthy process of boarding boats and reaching the temple has been streamlined, reducing the journey time to just three hours. This remarkable bridge offers not only modern conveniences but also embodies symbols of spiritual significance, catering to the needs of both travellers and devotees alike. The bridge will help ease transportation and significantly reduce the travel time between Dwarka and Beyt-Dwarka. Before the bridge, the devotees relied on boat transport to reach Beyt Dwarka.\n\nBuilt for Rs 980 crore, the Sudarshan Setu stretches over 2320 meters, realising Prime Minister Modi's visionary initiative. Commencing its construction in 2018, the bridge features 38 pillars strategically erected in the sea, culminating in its completion today. Renowned for its sleek and contemporary design, the bridge not only enhances the region's aesthetics but also promises substantial benefits for pilgrims and locals alike. During emergencies, such as hospital crises, Dwarka relied on emergency boats, often resulting in time constraints and compromised healthcare access. However, with the Sudarshan Setu now operational, swift vehicular access to urban centres during emergencies ensures timely and efficient assistance, bridging essential services to those in need.\n\nThe Sudarshan Setu boasts a distinctive design adorned with sacred verses from the Shrimad Bhagwad Gita and teachings of dharma, alongside captivating depictions of Lord Krishna. Enhancing its allure further, solar panels line the upper portion of the bridge's footpath, shielding travellers from the sun while generating up to one megawatt of electricity. This sustainable energy source will illuminate the bridge, ensuring safety and visibility, while also serving as a testament to modern eco-friendly infrastructure.\n\nBeyond its aesthetic appeal, the bridge significantly streamlines transportation, providing pilgrims and tourists with expedited travel routes and saving valuable time. As a focal point of Dwarka, the Sudarshan Setu stands not only as a symbol of connectivity but also as a beacon of cultural and spiritual significance.\n\nStretching 2320 meters in length, with 900 meters supported by cables, the bridge incorporates extensive features for convenience and aesthetics. Additionally, a spacious parking facility has been built to accommodate visitors. Adorning the main area of the bridge are ornate torans spanning up to 130 meters. With a width of 27.20 meters and four lanes, the bridge also includes 2.50 meters of footpath on either side. Along these footpaths, captivating depictions of Lord Krishna grace the walls, adding to the bridge's charm and cultural significance.\n\nIn addition to its practical features, the bridge offers tourists breathtaking views of natural landscapes and the sea. Throughout the structure, viewing galleries have been strategically placed at 12 locations, providing pilgrims and visitors with optimal vantage points to admire the scenic beauty of the sea and Dwarka.\n\nFurthermore, the bridge is set to dazzle during the evening hours, thanks to state-of-the-art lighting installations that enhance its allure and visibility. Adding to its aesthetic appeal, the pillars of the bridge are adorned with designs resembling peacock feathers, which will be seen both day and night.",

Cameras have been installed on the border of the villages and the forest. Local people get alerts on their mobile whenever a tiger comes near a village with the help of AI. Prime Minister hailed this system for providing a lot of convenience to the people in the 13 villages around this Tiger Reserve.\n\nMr Modi highlighted that young entrepreneurs are also working on new innovations for wildlife conservation and eco-tourism. In Roorkee, Uttarakhand, Rotor Precision Group in collaboration with Wildlife Institute of India has developed a drone which is helping to keep an eye on the crocodiles in the Ken River. Prime Minister also cited the example of a Bengaluru company that has prepared an app named 'Bagheera' and 'Garuda'.\n\nWith the Bagheera App, the speed of the vehicle and other activities can be monitored during a jungle safari. It is being used in many Tiger Reserves of the country. The Garuda App, based on Artificial Intelligence and Internet of Things, provides real time alerts on connecting it to any CCTV.\n\nPrime Minister emphasized that the biodiversity of the country is becoming richer with every such effort towards conservation of wildlife. He praised the tribal families living in Khatkali village near Melghat Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra for living in harmony with nature. The local people there have converted their houses into homestays with the help of the government which is becoming a big source of income for them. Mr Modi mentioned Prakash Jamkar of Korku tribe living in the village who has built a seven-room homestay on his two hectare land. His family makes arrangements for food and drink for the tourists staying at his place. Along with medicinal plants, he has also planted mango and coffee trees around his house.\n\nMr Modi also spoke about goat rearing which has become a major means of livelihood for people. He said that in Odisha's Kalahandi, goat rearing has also raised the standard of living of local people. He lauded the effort of management professionals Jayanti Mahapatra and her husband Biren Sahu, who established Manikastu Agro and started working with the farmers. Jayanti and Biren have also opened a Manikastu Goat Bank and are promoting goat rearing at the community level. Mr Modi said more than one thousand farmers from 50 villages are associated with this couple today.\n\nPrime Minister also lauded Bhim Singh Bhavesh of Bhojpur in Bihar for his work among the people of the Musahar caste. He said Musahar has been a very deprived community in Bihar and Bhim Singh Bhavesh has focused on the education of the children of this community. Bhim Singh Bhavesh has enrolled about eight thousand children of Musahar caste in school. He has also built a big library, through which children are getting better facilities for education.\n\nPrime Minister said there are many people like Bhim Singh Bhavesh in different parts of the country, who are engaged in many such noble endeavors in the society. He added that if every citizen performs his or her duties as a responsible citizen, it will be helpful in building a strong nation.\n\nMr Modi spoke about the diversity of India, and laid emphasis on use of mother tongue. He cited the example of Mohammad Manshah of Ganderbal in Jammu and Kashmir who has been engaged in efforts to preserve the Gojri language for the last three decades. Prime Minister mentioned Banwang Losu of Tirap in Arunachal Pradesh who has contributed in the spread of Wancho language so that it can be saved from extinction.\n\nPrime Minister said there are many people who are engaged in preserving their culture and language through songs and dances. He found the life of Venkappa Ambaji Sugetkar of Karnataka very inspiring. Sugatkar, a resident of Bagalkot, is a folk singer who has sung more than 1000 Gondhali songs and has also widely propagated stories in this language.\n\nMr Modi announced that the National Creators Award has been started in the country to honour the talent of content creators. He said that preparations are being made to honour change makers in different categories who are using technology to become effective voices of social change. The contest is running on MyGov. Mr Modi urged content creators to join the contest and the people to nominate their favorite content creators for the National Creators Award.",

        "text": "2. Learn about the significance of these inaugurations and their impact on healthcare infrastructure ahead of the Lok Sabha elections 2024.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi is poised to inaugurate five new campuses of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Sunday, with significant attention focused on Gujarat's inaugural AIIMS in Rajkot. Additionally, the Prime Minister will dedicate four other AIIMS campuses located in Punjab's Bathinda, Uttar Pradesh's Rae Bareli, Kalyani in West Bengal, and Mangalagiri in Andhra Pradesh.\n\nThis move marks a substantial development initiative by PM Modi ahead of the announcement of Lok Sabha elections 2024 by the Election Commission. Each new AIIMS campus represents a crucial addition to India's healthcare infrastructure, aiming to enhance medical education and healthcare services across various regions of the country.\n\nAIIMS Kalyani, situated in West Bengal's Nadia district, covers a sprawling area of over 20,000 square meters. Despite its commencement, the campus has faced controversy regarding environmental clearances, as reported by Hindustan Times.\n\nThe Rae Bareli AIIMS campus, approved during the UPA government's tenure in 2009, has seen partial functionality of its outpatient department since 2018. Similarly, the Mangalagiri AIIMS in Andhra Pradesh commenced its outpatient services in 2019, initially operating from a temporary campus at Vijayawada's Government Siddhartha Medical College.\n\nIn Rajkot, Gujarat's first AIIMS welcomed its inaugural academic batch in 2020, marking a significant milestone in the state's healthcare landscape. Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to visit Rajkot AIIMS and address a rally at the Race Course ground later in the evening, according to government statements.\n\nAIIMS Bathinda in Punjab boasts 39 functional departments, catering to the healthcare needs of the region. These AIIMS campuses represent the government's commitment to expanding healthcare infrastructure and ensuring quality medical education and services across India.",

        "text": "Roadblock with political purpose, inauguration to proceed, counters Union minister\n\nThe ongoing clash between the Union government and the Bengal government, escalating in the run-up to the upcoming national election, has now incorporated environment as a pivotal point of contention.\n\nThe All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Kalyani, West Bengal, set to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 25, 2024, is reportedly functioning without obtaining the mandatory environmental clearance (EC), as per officials from the state pollution control board.\n\nThe hospital is set to be inaugurated by PM Modi virtually on February 25 afternoon in presence of West Bengal Governor C V Ananda Bose and several Union government ministers.\n\nThe medical institute is the first AIIMS in the state, however, it is supposed to be closed under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, said officials of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board (WBPCB).\n\nWBPCB Chairman Kalyan Rudra and other officials alleged AIIMS Kalyani is spread over 20,000 square metres and has been constructed without taking the clearance. As per the directives from the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), any project exceeding 20,000 sqm must obtain environmental clearance in advance.\n\nWBPCB Chairman Kalyan Rudra and other officials at media meet on AIIMS Kalyani. Photo: Jayanta Basu\n\nThe statutory organisation under state government emphasised that the breach cannot be legalised at this point, citing two consecutive Supreme Court rulings that have nullified the regularisation provision introduced by the central government a few years ago for ease of carrying out businesses.\n\nSubhas Sarkar, Bharatiya Janata Party member, Minister of State for Education and member of AIIMS governing body, countered the allegation. \"WBPCB is playing politics to stop an institution of public interest and that too just before PM Modi is set to inaugurate virtually,\" he said.\n\n\"Any building with more than 20,000 sqm needs environment clearance as per MoEFCC norm. AIIMS Kalyani, which is set to be inaugurated on Sunday, does not have the mandatory clearance,\" said Rudra on February 24, 2024 in a media meet held at state PCB head office at Salt Lake.\n\nWhen questioned, Rudra confirmed that the ongoing operation of the hospital, in the absence of environmental clearance, should be considered as illegal.\n\n\"The building has been constructed without taking the clearance, and presently, we cannot regularise the violation post facto and give permission as SC has recently cancelled such an option of regularisation in Environment Protection Act, 1986 that was earlier brought on by MoEFCC through two orders,\" added Rudra.\n\nHe mentioned that approximately 25 projects in the state and numerous others across the country are facing similar repercussions as a result of the SC order.\n\nHSCC India Ltd, which was entrusted with the assignment to construct AIIMS Kalyani, applied for environmental clearance under 'violation' category on October 6, 2022. However, the hospital complex started operating in 2019. The State Expert Appraisal Committee (SEAC), responsible for assessing applications, recommended it for a clearance but slapped it with a penalty of around Rs 15.1 crores as per the norm.\n\nFollowing this, the project proponent appealed to the State-level Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), a higher authority than SEAC, to exempt the hospital from the penalty. However, the authority rejected the request based on the observation of the MoEFCC to which the letter had been forwarded for clarification. The matter was subsequently referred back to SEAC on February 16, 2024.\n\n\"Further to note that the SC through its orders dated January 2, 2024 and February 2, 2024 has stayed the operation of the Office Memorandum dated July 7, 2021 and January 20, 2022 issued by MoEFCC (about post facto regularisation of Environment Clearance-related violations),\" pointed out a WBPCB communication.\n\n\"... therefore, considering the above-mentioned order of the SC, the environment clearance for the project cannot be considered at this stage as the project is under violation category,\" it added.\n\n\"The West Bengal government is creating roadblocks for a hospital with political purposes by abusing power through the environment department,\" claimed Sarkar, alleging that WBPCB has not shared any correspondence in the recent past on this issue.\n\n\"The latest release of PCB clearly reflects the negative attitude of the West Bengal establishments and against public interest... this kind of obstructionism is reprehensible. So many AIIMS in India are being run in an environment friendly way and AIIMS Kalyani will also work in compliance with all environmental pollution norms,\" Sarkar told this reporter on February 24.\n\nThe minister characterised the absence of environmental clearance as a communication lapse and accused WBPCB of exploiting it to obstruct a noble and important project in West Bengal.\n\n\"What measures is the PCB taking to curb widespread environmental violations throughout the state, aside from attempting to halt the functioning of a hospital,\" asked Sarkar.\n\nThere are also questions as to why the matter of environmental clearance has surfaced at the eleventh hour, just before the official inauguration.\n\n\"The construction has started in 2016, academics began in 2019, outdoor patient service in 2021 and indoor patient services began in 2013,\" asked a senior official of AIIMS, adding that the hospital now caters to 2,000 patients daily outdoors; and 400 patients indoors though it has provision of close to 1,000 beds.\n\n\"We are presenting this information now for the sake of clarity and transparency, responding to inquiries raised about its environmental status,\" explained Rudra when questioned about why the PCB has raised the issue at the last moment.",

He said, some day, analysts will seek an answer as to why all the development that happened in the remote Machhedi and Bani area in the last 10 years, could not happen in the earlier six decades.\n\nOn the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh also informed Rs 20 lakh for Machhedi from his MP fund, out of which Rs 10 lakh had already been allocated for a Community Hall, he said.\n\nDr Jitendra Singh said, the best way to appreciate 10 years of the Modi Government is to recall the scenario that existed in the 10 years prior to that. When Shri Modi took over as Prime Minister in 2014, the entire country was reeling under the shadow of pessimism and the common citizen had lost all hope.\n\nToday, even people living in remote areas like here feel confident that their elected representatives sincerely care for them and are constantly working hard to get new projects for them, said Dr Jitendra Singh. This change has been possible because we have the Modi government at the Centre, he added.\n\nReferring to the massive developments seen in the far flung hilly regions like Machhedi and Bani, Dr Jitendra Singh said, PM Modi had promised that he would raise the neglected and peripheral regions of the country to the same equal level as the more developed regions and he has succeeded in doing so. He said, Bani which was one of the most inaccessible regions in the Jammu division, had in the last 10 years received a network of roads through Central funds and new Highways are under construction.\n\nAccusing the earlier governments of deliberately neglecting the far flung hilly regions, Dr Jitendra Singh said, perhaps the motive was that the people living in these remote areas should remain perpetually deprived of the opportunities unfolding in the rest of the world.\n\n\"Modi Government also provided level playing field to the aspirations of youth from even the remotest area in Jammu and Kashmir\", said Dr. Jitendra Singh.\n\nThe Union Minister said, \"Reforms under DoPT such as abolition of interviews in public examination gave a fair chance to the youth from remotest hilly areas and poorest backgrounds to emerge successful\".\n\nAccording to Dr.Jitendra Singh, Chhatargala Tunnel will provide all-weather road connectivity from Lakhanpur through Bani to Bhadarwah which will lead to ease of travel, generate employment opportunities and harness tourist potential of the region.\n\nMaximum allocation under PMGSY has been done in Udhampur-Kathua-Doda to improve road connectivity to villages, said Dr.Jitendra Singh.\n\n\"Bani region has locations as scenic as Kashmir valley, my aim is to bring it on tourist map of India by increasing road connectivity of the region\", the Minister said.",

        "title": "Protests in two more villages; BJP says Sandeshkhali situation like Nandigram",
        "text": "Sandeshkhali has been tense since February first week after villagers went on a rampage while accusing TMC strongman Shahjahan Sheikh and his aides of land grab and sexual harassment.\n\nOver the past two days, similar protests have erupted in Jhupkali and Belmajur villages of Sandeshkhali. In Jhupkali, protestors had set ablaze the guard room of a fishery on Friday alleging that it was set up on encroached land. A day later, local residents had allegedly ransacked the house of TMC leader Ajit Maity and beat him up.\n\nWest Bengal Director General of Police Rajeev Kumar had visited Belmajur on Friday night. Accepting that there had been a \"mistake\", he had assured villagers that the police would \"establish the rule of law\".\n\nIn Halderpara, residents reportedly chased the family members of a local TMC leader alleging that he had forcibly grabbed their land and given it to Sheikh's brother Sirajuddin.\n\nA few kilometres away in Majherpara, protestors hit the streets and sought the arrest of the two brothers. While police were trying to disperse the mob, a woman protestor was seen asking them: \"Why are you not arresting Shahjahan Sheikh. You are now asking us to file complaints. When we went to file complaints, we were not entertained. TMC leaders beat us up in front of the police. Why did you not take any action then? We do not want the government's help. We do not want Mamata Banerjee's sympathy. We need peace. We are demanding a death penalty of Sheikh.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the police set up a complaint centre in Belmajur village and received over 50 complaints from villagers. Most of the\n\ncomplaints were of land grabbing and against Sheikh and his brother. The complaint centre is part of an outreach programme started by the government on February 18 for Sandeshkhali.\n\nTill Friday, more than 700 applications had poured in at the block development office (BDO) in Sandeshkhali village. West Bengal ministers Partha Bhowmick and Sujit Bose also visited Belamajur on Saturday.\n\nTalking to media persons, Bhowmick said, \"We come here as the government's representatives. We got a report that the routes of irrigation channels in Sandeshkhali have been diverted to drain saltwater in different fields. We also heard all the allegations. We will restore those canals within 20 days.\" \"We have assured villagers of solving the problems and asked those who claimed that their land plots were taken away to lodge complaints,\" Bose, the minister for fire and emergency services, said.\n\nTMC MLA from Sandeshkhali Sukumar Mahato, who accompanied the ministers, said the ruling party had expelled Sirajuddin in January. \"After receiving various complaints against Sirajuddin, we had expelled him a month ago. He assured us that would return all encroached land(to villagers) but meanwhile the Sandeshkhali agitation had started.\"\n\nThe upheaval in Sandeshkhali has stoked a political storm in Bengal with the Opposition parties slamming the Mamata Banerjee-led government over the allegations levelled against TMC leaders. Hitting out at the state government on Saturday, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)likened the situation in Sandeshkhali to Nandigram, where a movement against \"forcible\" land acquisition by the then Left Front government in 2007-08 had catapulted the TMC to power in 2011.\n\n\"The situation in Sandeshkhali is like Nandigram. In Nandigram, people fought against land acquisition and here people are fighting against land grabbing. Here, protest began after women started their movement against sexual harassment but land grabbing is the second most common allegation in Sandeshkhali,\" Leader of Opposition in state Assembly Suvendu Adhikari told reporters in Kolkata. Adhikari is the BJPMLA from Nandigram.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Kolkata, senior BJP Rashtriya Mahila Morcha president Vanathi Srinivasan said, \"Women are not at all safe in West Bengal. If the TMC government is so transparent, why are Opposition women MPs prevented from meeting the victims in Sandeshkhali? What are they trying to hide?\"\n\nOn Friday, BJP MP Locket Chatterjee was stopped from visiting Sandeshkhali by the police due to prohibitory orders imposed in the area. West Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury also hit out at the BJP and alleged that the party would try to give the Sandeshkhali issue a \"communal colour\".\"\n\nThe BJP would definitely try to give the (Sandeshkhali) incidents a communal colour. Modi will not let go of this golden opportunity of creating division (among the people). That is why he is coming to West Bengal thrice, thanks to the failure of the state government,\" Chowdhury told reporters. Modi will be in West BengalonMarch1and2aspartof his official programme and is expected to address a women's rally on March 6 in North 24 Parganas district where restive Sandeshkhali is located.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) state secretary Minakshi Mukherjee, who took a different route to reach Sandeshkhali to avoid being stopped by the administration, was stopped by the police and taken to Sandeshkhali ferry ghat on the banks of River Kalagachi.\n\nDYFI is the youth wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). Police claimed that she was stopped as Section 144 of the CrPC was imposed in the area. Mukherjee sat on a protest on the road. \"Two ministers are roaming here but no section 144 is applicable (for them). We said only three people will go to the village at a time. Then also, the police did not give us permission. They are doing illegal work. We will complain against these officers in court.\"\n\n\"People are alleging that their land was grabbed, their wages from the 100 Days'Work scheme were looted. They were assaulted. The West Bengal government has to give answers,\" she added.\n\nSheikh along with his aides Shibaprasad Hazra and Uttam Sardar has been accused of land grabbing and sexually harassing women by calling them to late night meetings at the TMC office. While Sardar and Hazra have been arrested, Sheikh has been absconding since the January 5 attack on ED officials in Sandeshkhali.\n\nThe team had gone to Sandeshkhali to search Sheikh's residence over alleged irregularities in the state's public distributions ystem.",

        "text": "Sudarshan Setu's overall length is 4,772 metres, including a 900-metre cable-stayed section. The Union government sponsored the four-lane bridge, which cost Rs 978 crore.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday inaugurated 'Sudarshan Setu', the country's longest cable-stayed bridge in Gujarat, which is designed to improve connectivity and tourism. PM Modi described it as a \"stunning project\" and said the opening was a \"special day for Gujarat's growth trajectory\". The bridge spans the Arabian Sea, connecting Beyt Dwarka island to mainland Okha in Gujarat's Devbhumi Dwarka district. It links Okha, a town in the Devbhumi Dwarka region of mainland Gujarat, to Bet Dwarka, an island about 3 kilometers away. Its overall length is 4,772 metres, including a 900-metre cable-stayed section. The Union government sponsored the four-lane bridge, which cost Rs 978 crore.\n\n1. At 4,772 meters (4.77 km) in length, Sudarshan Setu now holds the title of India's longest cable-stayed bridge. Bhavnagar has a single cable-stayed bridge, but its length is merely a few dozen meters. Meanwhile, the Narmada bridge in Bharuch stretches over 1.3 kilometers. \"However, the Narmada bridge is an extra dosed cable-stayed bride, which technically differs from a typical cable-stayed bridge like Sudarshan Setu, as the latter's spans can be longer,\" stated a senior official.\n\n2. Bet Dwarka is the second biggest island off the Gujarat coast, behind the Union Territory of Diu, which is located on the Una coast in Gir Somnath. While Diu has a geographical area of around 40 square kilometers, Bet Dwarka covers 36 square kilometers. The island of Bet Dwarka is part of Okha municipality and has a population of around 10,000. Currently, the sole mode of transportation between Bet Dwarka and mainland Gujarat is a ferry boat service that runs from Dwarka to Okha, the nearest point on the mainland. The Signature Bridge will give all-weather road access to the island.\n\n3. Sudarshan Setu lets worshipers to access the famed Dwarkadhish temple of Lord Krishna in Beyt Dwarka at any time, which was previously only feasible during the day by boat.\n\n4. The bridge is upheld by 32 piers, sustaining seven cable-stayed spans each measuring 900 meters in length. Termed as the navigation section, this segment facilitates the passage of fishing boats to and from the Dalda Bandar harbor.\n\n5. In addition to its 27-meter-wide carriageway, the bridge features walkways on both sides, adorned with verses from the Bhagavad Gita and depictions of Krishna on its pillars. Solar panels serve as the roofing for these walkways.",

Nationwide, Hindus, Muslims, Christians and other groups follow their own laws and customs or a secular code for such matters. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has promised a Uniform Civil Code, opposed by Muslims.\n\nAssam repealed the Assam Muslim Marriages and Divorces Registration Act, 1935, effective from Feb. 24, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma wrote on X on Saturday. \"This act contained provisions allowing marriage registration even if the bride and groom had not reached the legal ages of 18 and 21... This move marks another significant step towards prohibiting child marriages in Assam.\"\n\nAsked by Reuters on Sunday whether the northeastern state would implement a Uniform Civil Code before general elections due by May, Sarma said: \"Not immediately\". Many Muslims in Assam trace their roots to the neighbouring Bengali-speaking and Muslim-majority country of Bangladesh. Tension often flares between the Muslims and ethnic Assamese, who are mostly Hindu.\n\nThe BJP, the governing party in Assam - and Uttarakhand - calls itself the champion of ethnic communities. Muslim opposition leaders said repealing the colonial-era law was discriminatory.\n\n\"They want to polarise their voters by provoking Muslims, which Muslims will not let happen,\" Badruddin Ajmal, a lawmaker from Assam who heads the All India United Democratic Front that mainly fights for Muslim causes, told reporters on Saturday. \"It's a first step towards bringing a Uniform Civil Code, but this is how the BJP government will come to an end in Assam.\"",

        "text": "New Delhi, Feb 25: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday stressed on the need to protect the youth from drug addiction and said a strong family support system is needed to combat the vice.\n\n\"For building a substance-free India, it is imperative for families to be strong as an institution,\" he said in a video address to the 'Ashwamedha Yagya' event organised by the 'Gayatri Parivar'.\n\nWhen family as an institution weakens and its values decline, then it has an all-round impact, he said.\n\nWhen family members do not meet or sit together for days, then dangers rise and, therefore, families have to be strong to make the country drug-free, the prime minister said.\n\nThe 'Ashwamedha Yagya' has become a grand social campaign, he said, highlighting its role in steering millions of youths away from addiction and towards nation-building activities.\n\nDrug addiction is such a vice that can destroy lives, causing great harm to society and the country, he said.\n\nYouths are the future of the nation and play a pivotal role in shaping India's destiny, and contribute to its development, he said.\n\nPrime Minister Modi said he had some dilemma in associating with an event named 'Ashwamedha Yagya' as the phrase in popular imagination is linked to an expansion of power. Elections are also approaching, he added.\n\nHowever, this exercise has a noble purpose, he said, praising the 'Gayatri Parivar' for its work and teachings.\n\nIn his comments, Modi emphasised the need to protect the youth from the grip of addiction and provide support to those already affected.\n\n\"Addiction wreaks havoc on individuals and societies, causing immense damage,\" he said, reaffirming the government's commitment to the nationwide initiative for a drug-free India that has engaged with more than 11 crore people since its launch.\n\nHe highlighted the extensive outreach efforts including bike rallies, oath-taking ceremonies and street plays conducted in collaboration with social and religious organisations.\n\nThe integration of the youth with larger national and global initiatives will help them keep away from any addiction, the prime minister said, noting their important role in achieving the goals of a developed and self-reliant India.\n\nIn national and global campaigns, the more the youth is involved, the more they will stay away from the wrong path, he said.\n\nSpeaking on the government's focus on sports and science, Modi said the success of the Chandrayaan mission has sparked a new interest for technology, asserting that such events have a transformative impact in channelling the energy of the youth in the right direction.\n\nHe said initiatives like the Fit India Movement and the Khelo India will motivate the youth and \"a motivated youth cannot turn towards substance abuse\".\n\nReferring to the new organisation 'Mera Yuva Bharat (MY Bharat)', the prime minister said more than 1.5 crore youths have already registered with the portal giving a push to the right use of youth power for nation building.\n\nHe noted that during the 'Pran Pratishtha' (consecration ceremony) at the Ram temple, he had spoken of the beginning of the new journey of a thousand years for India.\n\n\"In this Amrit Kaal, we are witnessing the dawn of this new era,\" Prime Minister Modi said, expressing optimism about India's journey towards becoming a global leader with individual development shaping the national development.

        "text": "On the second day of his Gujarat visit, PM Modi cut the ceremonial ribbon and dedicated the 4.77-km-long Sudarshan Setu, also known as Signature Bridge, to the nation. Constructed at Rs 978 crore, it connects Okha town in the Devbhumi Dwarka district with Bet Dwarka island in the Gulf of Kutch.\n\nAfter performing pooja at the Dwarkadhishji Mukhya Mandir, PM Modi took a stroll on the sealink and waved to fishermen and ferry-boat operators on board their boats.\n\nModi landed in Jamnagar city late on Saturday evening and led a road show there. After staying for the night in Jamnagar circuit house, PM Modi flew to Bet Dwarka, which is around 160 km away from Jamnagar, on Sunday morning. After landing on the island, which is part of Okha municipality, Modi offered prayers at Shree Dwarkadhishji Mukhya Mandir, a temple of Lord Krishna on Bet Dwarka island. Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel and senior ministers of the Gujarat government accompanied him.\n\nThe sealink, Gujarat's first, has been constructed by the national highway division in the Roads and Buildings Department of Gujarat. The bridge was constructed as part of National Highway 51 and funded by the Centre.\n\nThe 4.77-km-long sealink has a 2.32 km (2,320 metres) bridge section, including a 900 metres (0.90 km) cable-stayed section, the longest in India. The 2.32-km-long superstructure of the bridge is supported by 32 piers, including two towers rising 18 metres above the sea.\n\nThe cable-stayed structure will allow navigation of fishing boats and other vessels. The cable-stayed section in Sudarshan Setu is longer than the one in Bandra-Worli Sea Link in Mumbai. Sudarshan Setu has a 1.21-km (1,215 metres) approach on the Bet Dwarka side and a 1.23-km (1,237 metres) approach on the Okha side.\n\nBet Dwarka is located three kilometres off Okha town, the nearest point in mainland Gujarat. It is part of Okha municipality and has a population of around 10,000. So far, the only means of transport between the island and the mainland was ferry boats. Modi laid the foundation stone for this bridge in October 2017 and the construction started in 2018. Work on the bridge was completed on February 14 this year.\n\nAfter inaugurating the bridge, PM Modi flew to the temple town Dwarka, around 30 km away. Modi led a roadshow through the town, which culminated at Jagat Mandir, the famous Lord Krishna temple, which is also known as Dwarkadhish Mandir. Modi offered prayers at the temple until late morning. After performing pooja at Dwarkadhish Mandir, Modi is scheduled to address a public meeting in Dwarka at 1 PM.\n\nIn the afternoon, PM Modi will fly to Rajkot and inaugurate the permanent campus of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Rajkot. After inaugurating the AIIMS Rajkot campus in Para Pipaliya village on the outskirts of Rajkot, Modi will address a public meeting in the Race Course ground of Rajkot from where he will also inaugurate campuses of AIIMS in Bathinda of Punjab, Raebareli in Uttar Pradesh, Kalyani in West Bengal and Mangalagiri in Andhra Pradesh. In all, the PM will inaugurate or lay the foundation stone of Rs 48,000 crore worth of projects from Rajkot.\n\nPM Modi is also likely to stay for the night in Rajkot on Sunday even as his itinerary for Monday has yet to be made public.",

        "text": "Warriors of the Konyak Naga tribe earned their tattoos after headhunting missions. Konyaks are one of the tribes whose people and land are both in India and Myanmar. (Image: Getty)\n\nThe tattooed face of Honngo Wangshu tells a story from an altogether different era. It speaks of a time when Konyak warriors would venture into what is now Myanmar and bring back heads from rival villages.\n\nThe blue-black on Wangshu's face is in stark contrast to the green of the hilly terrain in Longwa, a Nagaland village on the border with Myanmar.\n\nThere are no border fencing or sentry outposts. A single-lane cement road acts as the line separating the two countries. Step off it, you are in Myanmar.\n\nFor centuries, free movement has been the way of life for the Nagas living along the border. They have relatives and agricultural fields on both sides of the border of India and Myanmar, and always had unhindered access to them.\n\nLongwa village is in Nagaland's Mon district. Mon is the land of the fearless Konyak tribe of Nagas.\n\nHonngo Wangshu made several trips into what is now Myanmar with his fellow villagers on head-hunting missions. One of the last of the inked headhunters, Wangshu, earned his stripes with his bravery and machete. A \"devout Christian now\", he doesn't want to speak of \"those violent times\".\n\nWhat Honngo Wangshu instead wants to talk about is the fear and worry in the heart of the fearless Konyaks of Longwa.\n\nVillagers, he says, are worried about the decision to scrap the Free Movement Regime (FMR) with Myanmar and fencing of the entire border.\n\nThe FMR with Myanmar, formalised by the government in 2018 as part of its Act East Policy, formally allowed tribals living along the border to venture up to 16 km in the two countries without any travel documents, something people have been doing since time immemorial.\n\nThe government also plans to fence the entire 1,643 km of the border with Myanmar that passes through dense jungles and hilly terrain. Only 10km of that border at Moreh in Manipur is now fenced.\n\n\"The Modi government is committed to building impenetrable borders. It has decided to construct a fence along the entire 1643-kilometer-long Indo-Myanmar border,\" Home Minister Amit Shah said in an X post on February 6.\n\nHonang Konyak, a tribal leader and former general secretary of the Konyak Union refers to the border as the \"imaginary line\" and tells IndiaToday.In that Konyak villages along it would lose their customary land that stretches beyond the line if a fence comes up.\n\nMany villagers will lose their livelihood as they have \"ancestral jhumland beyond the imaginary line\", the Konyak leader says.\n\nThat's what worries Wangshu, the former headhunter. \"Besi kheti asey Burma fhali (We have more agricultural land across the border in Myanmar),\" Wanghsu, in his 80s, tells IndiaToday.In from Longwa.\n\nThe Indo-Myanmar border has cut through the traditional land of the Konyaks, with most people having relatives and ancestral lands in both India and Myanmar. The border wasn't a concern until the government came up with the plans for fencing it.\n\nLongwa straddling the Indo-Myanmar border is unique.\n\nHalf of the residence of the Angh (king) of Longwa is in India, while the other half is in Myanmar. The residents of the king's house eat in Myanmar and sleep in India.\n\nIn the village church, of which Honngo Wangshu is the treasurer, half of the congregation sits in India and the other half in Myanmar.\n\n\"Which country will own Longwa and its Angh's residence,\" asks Honang Konyak. \"The ancestral customary influence of Anghship over satellite villages will be completely cut off,\" he says, pointing to a possible break in a centuries-old tradition.\n\nIn Longwa, dozens of students from Myanmar study in Shalom School as education is almost free in the missionary-run institute.\n\n\"The villagers are worried about the border fencing plan. We have over 20 Konyak villages on the Myanmar side. The ground reality wasn't taken into account when the border was drawn. Longwa has been split by the line,\" Amao Konyak, the Hindi teacher at the government school in Longwa, tells IndiaToday.In.\n\nLike the tattooed former headhunter, the 40-year-old teacher too says that he has \"jhum kheti\" (land for slash-and-burn agriculture) across the border in Myanmar.\n\nOther than Nagaland, where Longwa is located, three other Indian states - Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Mizoram -- share their borders with Myanmar.\n\nHow did the border as it exists today come to be demarcated?\n\nA large part of North East India, including Manipur and Assam (present day Nagaland and Mizoram were part of Assam then), was under the rule of Burmese kings (of Konbuang dynasty) until the first Anglo-Burmese war, which led to the signing of the Treaty of Yandaboo in 1826, explains Tuisem Ngakang, an assistant professor of history in Delhi University.\n\nIt is the treaty of Yandaboo that led to the demarcation of the territories of British-ruled India and Burma (now Myanmar).\n\n\"This continued until 1969, when the boundary agreement was ratified between the Government of the Republic of India and the Union of Burma. This was followed by the erecting of border posts by both countries. Despite the demarcation of boundaries, there has been free movement of people, particularly among the transborder tribes. The Independence of India in 1947 and Burma in 1948 did not alter the relations and movement of people across the border,\" Ngakang tells IndiaToday.In.\n\nThe demarcation, however, resulted in the creation of two distinct nationalities by dividing the ethnic population of the region into two separate nations.\n\n\"An imaginary line was used to demarcate the land without the consent of the people and hence it has become both a social and political issue today,\" says tribal leader Honang Konyak, highlighting that the border decision was implemented without the resident's knowledge.\n\nMovement and trade saw an increase in frequency following the agreement between the two nations in 2018 to enact the Free Movement Regime (FMR), says Ngakang. \"However, India suspended the FMR in September 2022 due to the ongoing escalation of the refugee crisis following the military coup in Myanmar,\" he adds.\n\nThe border fencing plan comes amid the ethnic clashes between the Meiteis and Kuki-Zo communities in Manipur.\n\nManipur is fighting the fire of the Meitei-Kuki ethnic clashes that erupted on May 3, 2023.\n\nThe state's Chief Minister, N Biren Singh, has been demanding the scrapping of the FMR and fencing of the border with Myanmar. He has blamed the woes of Manipur on the influx of illegal immigrants from the Kuki-Zo community and the drug and weapons smuggling through the porous border.\n\nBiren Singh and Meitei organisations expressed their gratitude to the Centre after the decision to scrap the FMR was announced. Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and his Arunachal counterpart Pema Khandu too expressed their happiness.\n\nThere have been protests in Mizoram over the decision, and the Nagaland Assembly is likely to take up the issue in its upcoming Budget session. The powerful Naga Students' Federation has asked the Centre to reconsider its decision on the FMR and to fence the border.\n\nTribal leader Honngo Konyak highlights how the Nagas and their way of life have nothing to do with the recent problems. \"Unlike other refugees that create political and social chaos in northeastern states, the Nagas are unique. There is no single landless Naga family on both sides. Nagas may wander around, but they will always return home in the evening,\" he says.\n\nRami Niranjan Desai, author, anthropologist and expert on northeast India, said the decision to restrict the Free Movement Regime was a \"timely and appropriate action\" as \"the FMR privilege was being misused\". \"With the deteriorating condition in Myanmar there has been an influx of refugees as well,\" Desai tells IndiaToday.In.\n\nNortheast states are dealing with the problem of illegal immigration that has also led to large-scale demographic changes in certain areas. Huge quantities of drugs being smuggled from across Myanmar are regularly seized by Indian forces.\n\n\"One expects a responsible government to put the safety and security of its own people before others. The FMR, in essence, is a great policy, but if it has been misused to create unrest in India, then this is absolutely the right move. However, this does not mean that all those who were transiting were illegally settling in India or causing unrest. But because of the few, the larger society suffers,\" says India Foundation's Rami Niranjan Desai.\n\nThe FMR move is a worry, but the fencing plan is a bigger cause of concern for the transborder tribes. The Konyaks of Longwa are just one of the 17 tribes of Nagaland. Then there are several other tribes in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Mizoram, states that share their borders with Myanmar.\n\nResidents on both sides of the Indo-Myanmar border share a deep emotional connection due to their shared cultural affinity. Several tribes and subtribes with the same roots are spread across the two countries.\n\nNumerous ethnicities inhabiting northeast India find their counterparts across the borders of Myanmar.\n\n\"Approximately one-third of the total Naga population resides in Myanmar, including over 30 Tangkhul Naga villages, more than 50 villages of Khiamniungan Naga, and a considerable number of Konyak,\" says historian Tuisem Ngakang.\n\nAnd it isn't just about Nagas. Other communities too have shared ancestry and cultural connections with people across the Myanmar border.\n\n\"The Singphos of Arunachal Pradesh have their counterparts in Myanmar, while the Zomis of Manipur and Kukis share close social, cultural, and political ties with around 40 or more subtribes of Myanmar. Notably, a sizable population of Meitei, known as Kathe, resides in Myanmar as well,\" explains Ngakang.\n\n\"We have our brothers over there,\" stressed Amao Konyak, the Hindi teacher from Longwa, about the kinship with the people across the shadow border.\n\nTuisem Ngakang explains why people are so sensitive about ties. \"Many tribes perceive themselves as stemming from the same ancestral lineage and maintain strong cultural ties. Moreover, most communities belong to the same ethnic groups and linguistic families. People residing along both borders have historically relied on each other for local trade, social gatherings, and even intermarriage.\"\n\nPeople from Longwa's Indian side go to Myanmar to farm, graze cattle and to hunt. Shops in Longwa, the village in Nagaland, see hordes of customers from across the main cemented road, which serves as the international border.\n\n\"People travel for two-three days to come to Longwa for provisions and essentials. The nearest towns in Myanmar for them are Lahe and Hkamti, where they need to travel more and commodities are more expensive than in India,\" Wangmai Longwa tells IndiaToday.In.\n\nThese people are mostly from the Konyak and Lainong tribes in the Naga Self-Administered Zone of Myanmar.\n\nThe 52-year-old has travelled into the interior of Myanmar around 90 times in the last 8 years for missionary work. He carried medicines and soap with him and \"taught the people to take a shower\".\n\n\"There is no open defecation on the Indian side, but it's prevalent on the Myanmar side. The tribals who reside on the other side lack basic sanitation and hygiene,\" says Wangmai. \"It is as if I took the Swachh Bharat Mission to Myanmar,\" he says with a laugh.\n\nThe fence will be a problem for people of both India and Myanmar, he says.\n\n\"It is between the governments of the two countries to decide on the FMR and the fencing, but they might lead to starvation on the Myanmar side,\" says Wangmai, who knows the Myanmar areas adjoining India like the back of his hand.\n\n\"The Myanmarese near India seems to be living in No Man's Land, without much support from their government. They need access to India to survive,\" he adds.\n\nWangmai Longwa agrees that border fences are a necessity because of arms and drugs smuggling, but he also urges checkpoints to allow the movement of \"genuine people\".\n\n\"Nagas cannot live in two nations. The Naga-dominated region in Myanmar is termed 'Naga Self-Administered Zone', which is self-explanatory. That's where the government of India can erect its border fencing on the Konyak-Naga ancestral and customary border and not on the imaginary line,\" suggests Honang Konyak, the former general secretary of the Konyak Union, the apex customary and social institution of the Konyak Naga tribe.\n\nHe says there is a standing resolution of the Konyak Union that \"it shall never allow border fencing on the imaginary line\". This resolution was endorsed by about 200 Konyak villages from both sides of the Indo-Myanmar border.\n\nThe Naga Students' Federation has requested the issue to be resolved through dialogue and understanding, \"respecting the historical context and the rights of the indigenous Naga community\".\n\n\"Yes there are transnational ethnic ties, and sure, the FMR was based on this transnational ethnic premise, but any policy that compromises national security has to be re-looked at,\" says India Foundation's Rami Niranjan Desai.\n\n\"The suspension of the FMR will create an alternative method for movement that will have new rules and processes that can trace illegal migrants, a common issue across the northeast. People before panicking about the suspension of the FMR should think logically and exercise patience,\" she advises.\n\nPeople, however, are worried and tensed.\n\nIn Longwa, the village of the former Konyak headhunters, Honngo Wangshu says villagers are unhappy over the decision to suspend the FMR and the plan to fence the border.\n\nHeadhunting was banned, and the last recorded incident took place in the 1960s.\n\n\"Headhunting wasn't a sport and the deeply devout Nagas believed God would intervene on their behalf,\" explains historian Tuisem Ngakang. Headhunting had a social and ritualistic significance among the Nagas.\n\nHonngo Wangshu, one of the last of the feared tattooed headhunters who is a \"reformed person\" now, pleads with the government.\n\n\"Ami khan Modi bachcha (We are Modi's children),\" he says in Nagamese, urging repeatedly like a child that his request be conveyed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to \"not fence Longwa and divide it\".\n\nAnd it isn't just about Longwa, but several villages and tribes.\n\nIf transnational movement is a way of life, safe borders are a modern national necessity. People on both sides just want the twain to meet.",

The Republican Party is present countrywide. People want me to come to Lok Sabha. I have repeatedly said that I am in Rajya Sabha till 2026 but people want me to come to Lok Sabha. So I feel that I should get a ticket from Shirdi to the Lok Sabha. I have lost there once. But the situation there is favourable now.\"\n\nAthawale revealed that he had discussed his ambitions with Union Home Minister Amit Shah and BJP President JP Nadda. He emphasised the importance of RPI obtaining at least one ticket, noting that failure to do so would not make a good impression on society.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The RPI needs to get at least one ticket, otherwise it will not give a good impression in the society. We have voters in villages. The Mahayuti government should discuss this. I have met Amit Shah and JP Nadda in this regard,\" the RPI chief told the news agency.\n\nAccording to the report, addressing the seat-sharing talks between Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Athawale voiced optimism and claimed that their coalition is insufficient to confront Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He further cited that the recent exits from the Opposition alliances reduced their influence.\n\n\"We do not fear their alliance because it does not have enough strength to defeat Prime Minister Modi. They will continue slandering PM Modi and putting forth their arrogance before the people. People are happy with PM Modi and they are with us. After Nitish Kumar and Jayant Chaudhury came out of the alliance and with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee deciding to contest in West Bengal alone, it does not have enough fuel,\" he was quoted as saying in ANI report.\n\nPer the ANI report, regarding the present discussions with farmers, Athawale stressed the necessity of compromise, stating that farmers should reciprocate when the government makes concessions. \"Earlier the government decided to increase MSP on some important crops but the farmers demanded MSP on all 23 crops. Our Agriculture Minister is trying to reach a solution. If the government is taking some steps back, farmers should also come to a compromise. We will reach a solution soon,\" Athawale said.\n\nAthawale also spoke about his recent trip to Lakshadweep, he said, \"This union territory is very important from the point of view of tourism. Meanwhile, the demand of Indians for tourism in Maldives has also increased...Prime Minister Modi had appealed that Indians should visit this island for tourism, so I also went to Lakshadweep with my family.\"",

Trinamool chief and Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had earlier declared that she would go solo after talks with the Congress over seat-sharing fell through. The state Congress unit, helmed by veteran leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, is learnt to have bargained for about 10 seats, but the Trinamool offered just two.\n\nFollowing Mr Chowdhury's outburst against the Trinamool chief, in which he called her \"opportunist\", Ms Banerjee said last month that the Congress had rejected all her proposals. \"We have decided to fight the elections in Bengal alone,\" she said, adding that any decision on an alliance will be taken after the polls.\n\nSince then, the Congress leadership has been trying to get Ms Banerjee back on board, with Rahul Gandhi saying that Mr Chowdhury's sharp remarks against the Trinamool chief \"won't matter\".\n\nThe two parties have not been able to reach an understanding on seats so far. Mr Chowdhury continues to target the Trinamool and has claimed that there are difference within the party on whether to ally with Congress or not. \"They are in a dilemma. They are not saying officially that the process of forging the alliance has ended. The first dilemma is a section of the party believes that if they contest alone, without the INDIA alliance, then the minorities of West Bengal will vote against them. One section of the TMC wants the alliance to continue. Another section is in another dilemma that if the alliance is given more importance in Bengal, then the Modi government will use ED, and CBI against them. Because of these two dilemmas, the TMC has not been able to make a clear decision,\" he has claimed.\n\nOwing to the tussle, Ms Banerjee did not join the Rahul Gandhi-led Bharat Jodo Nyay Yatra passing through Bengal, depriving the INDIA bloc to showcase optics that would have helped the alliance counter the BJP's political attacks over underlying conflict within the Opposition front. In the case of an understanding now, the two parties will face the tall challenge of hurriedly putting together a joint campaign plan and reaching out to the voters.\n\nWhat About Maharashtra?\n\nIn Maharashtra, too, the INDIA bloc is yet to announce a seat-sharing plan. Discussions between Maha Vikas Aghadi, comprising Congress, Shiv Sena (Balasaheb Uddhav Thackeray) and the Sharad Pawar-led faction of NCP are in the final phase.\n\nCongress leader Rahul Gandhi is learnt to have spoken to Mr Thackeray over a deadlock. The Congress, sources say, wants to contest three of Mumbai's six Lok Sabha seats - Mumbai South Central, Mumbai North Central and Mumbai North West. Mr Thackeray reportedly wants to contest 18 Lok Sabha seats in the state, including four in Mumbai - Mumbai South, Mumbai North West, Mumbai North East and Mumbai South Central. The two leaders spoke for an hour to find a way out of the impasse.\n\nThe Congress has also suffered setbacks in Maharashtra in the exits of three senior leaders -- Milind Deora, Ashok Chavan and Baba Siddique.\n\nState Congress chief Nana Patole has said there is no disagreement within the alliance and stressed that MVA will perform well in the upcoming polls. \"There are no disagreements or dispute on the issue of seat sharing among the MVA allies. It is the ruling Mahayuti which is in turmoil due to lack of coordination. The people of Maharashtra will show BJP and its allies their place in the coming elections,\" Mr Patole said.\n\nA big challenge for INDIA bloc in Maharashtra is that two main parties, Shiv Sena and NCP, have split and their leaders Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar have lost the party name and symbol. A big task would be to spread awareness among voters about their new name and symbol to ensure that people, especially in rural and backward areas, know which symbol to cast their vote on.\n\nOnce the seat-sharing is finalised, the three parties will need to start joint campaigns to take on the BJP. With polls just months away, they are on a very tight deadline.\n\nWhat's Sorted\n\nAfter months of political posturing and hard bagain, the Congress has managed to finalise seat-sharing pacts with two major INDIA forces - SP and AAP. In Uttar Pradesh, the Congress has secured 17 out of 80 seats. In return, it has given one seat in Madhya Pradesh to the Akhilesh Yadav-led party. With AAP, the Grand Old Party has finalised seat-sharing for Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Chandigarh and Goa. The two parties have agreed to go solo in Punjab, where they are arch-rivals.\n\nPromotedListen to the latest songs, only on JioSaavn.com\n\nAAP leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said there is no hostility between the allies over the Punjab arrangement. In Delhi, the Congress will contest three out of seven seats. And in Gujarat, the AAP will fight two out of 26 seats. In Haryana, the Congress and AAP will contest 8 and one seat, respectively. The Chandigarh seat and two seats in Goa have gone to Congress under the pact.\n\nA big challenge in these seats, however, will be to balance grassroots leaders' sentiments with the larger goal of taking on the BJP. For example, AAP securing the Bharuch seat, a stronghold of Congress veteran, late Ahmed Patel, has drawn strong reaction. Congress leaders, including Mr Patel's son Faisal Ahmed Patel, have said that the party must have retained the seat for winnability alone and that Congress workers are upset. While the AAP has said it would soon sit with the Congress to chalk out a strategy in this key seat, reaching an agreement may not be easy.",

        "text": "New Delhi, Feb 25 (PTI) India will strongly oppose a China-led proposal for an investment facilitation pact besides pressing for finding a permanent solution to public stock holding of grains for food security and protection of the interests of fishermen at the WTO ministerial meeting beginning Tuesday.\n\nThe Indian delegation is led by Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal. The four-day 13th ministerial conference (MC13) will start on February 26 in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nAlso Read | Sudarshan Setu Inauguration: PM Narendra Modi Set To Inaugurate Okha-Beyt Dwarka Signature Bridge on February 25, Know Everything About India's Longest Cable-Stayed Bridge (See Pics and Video).\n\nTrade ministers of 164 member countries of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) are meeting against the backdrop of the uncertain global economic situation due to the Red Sea crisis, the Ukraine-Russia war and the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nThe key issue of India's interests at the meeting relates to finding a permanent solution for its minimum support price (MSP) issue for food security, agricultural reforms, fisheries subsidies, e-commerce moratorium on import duties, dispute settlement, and WTO reforms.\n\nAlso Read | AP TET 2024 Admit Card Released at aptet.apcfss.in: Hall Ticket for Andhra Pradesh State Teacher Eligibility Test Examination Out, Know How To Download.\n\n*Food security issues\n\nThe public stock-holding (PSH) programme is a policy tool under which the government procures crops like rice and wheat from farmers at MSP, and stores and distributes foodgrains to the poor.\n\nIndia stresses the need for PSH for its large, vulnerable population and wants a permanent solution from the MC13. Food procurement, stockholding, and distribution are crucial to India's food security strategy.\n\nMSP is normally higher than the prevailing market rates and sells these at a low price to ensure food security for over 800 million beneficiaries. However, the WTO's Agreement on Agriculture limits the ability of a government to purchase food at MSP.\n\nUnder global trade norms, a WTO member country's food subsidy bill should not breach the limit of 10 per cent of the value of production based on the reference price of 1986-88.\n\nAs part of the solution, India has asked for measures like amendments in the formula to calculate the food subsidy cap. Developed nations are of the view that such programmes distort global trade prices of food grains.\n\n*Joint Support Initiatives (JSIs) or plurilateral agreements\n\nIndia opposes this move being pushed for certain nations. For example, India is strongly opposing efforts of a group of countries led by China to push a proposal on investment facilitation for development agreement at the WTO.\n\nThe country has maintained that this agenda falls outside the mandate of the global trade body.\n\nAccording to experts, the attempt of the group to integrate the proposal into the WTO has systemic concerns for the organisation and it would impact developing nations in pursuing their interest in future.\n\n*Agricultural reforms\n\nIndia's stance is to protect farmer livelihoods and ensure equitable market access. However, developed nations are pushing to reduce domestic support and increase market openness irrespective of the fact that they themselves provide large subsidies to their rich farmers.\n\n*WTO reforms\n\nIndia advocates for inclusive reforms that consider developing countries' interests, against the backdrop of developed nations' proposals for flexible negotiation processes, dropping of decision-making by consensus and the integration of non-trade issues into WTO without consensus.\n\nIndia supports efforts to improve the working of the WTO but its key pillars like special and differential treatment for less developed and developing nations, equal voice and dispute settlement mechanism should be retained while undertaking reforms, an official said.\n\nIndia also seeks a revamp of the Appellate Body to ensure fairness, facing off against the USA's reluctance to do so and EU's proposal for alternate mechanisms.\n\nThe US, a frequent participant in WTO disputes, has been obstructing the process due to dissatisfaction with inefficiencies and perceived overreaches by the WTO's judiciary.\n\n*Fisheries subsidies\n\nThe members have already reached the first part of the agreement in 2022 under which subsidies will be prohibited for illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.\n\nNow they are negotiating to curb subsidies that contribute to overfishing and overcapacity with a view to promoting sustainable fishing.\n\nIndia champions a balanced approach on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, an expert said.\n\nIndia, being a low fisheries subsidizer, emphasizes that advanced fishing nations that have historically provided substantial subsidies and contributed to fish stock depletion should bear more responsibility based on the 'polluter pay principle'.\n\n\"Our top priority will be to protect the interest of poor fishermen. About 90 lakh people are dependent on the sector in India,\" the official said.\n\nIndia has proposed that developing countries be allowed to give subsidies to their poor fishermen to catch fish till exclusive economic zones (EEZs) or up to 200 nautical miles from the shore; while rich countries engaged in fishing beyond this zone should stop providing any kind of subsidies for the next 25 years.\n\n*Extension of customs duties moratorium on e-commerce trade\n\nThe ongoing moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions, in place since 1998, is a contentious issue facing the WTO and a key focus point for India at the upcoming MC13.\n\nIndia, alongside several other developing nations, has historically called for the termination of the moratorium and has specific demands at MC13 to achieve this goal.\n\nDeveloped nations, however, are pushing for the permanent adoption of a duty-free flow of digital transmission.\n\n*New Issues\n\nIndia would maintain its stand that issues like labour, and environment are non-trade issues and they should not be discussed at the WTO.\n\nThe country has also emphasised that trade barriers like the EU's carbon tax and deforestation regulation should not be erected under the guise of sustainable development and there are different multilateral forums like in the United Nations where these issues can be discussed.\n\nDeveloped countries are also pushing to include women economic empowerment issues in the WTO talks.",

        "title": "For First Time in Taliban Era, Indian Technicians Return to Inspect $265 Million Dam in Afghanistan",
        "text": "New Delhi: For the first time since the Afghan Republic fell to the Taliban, India is checking in on the $265 million dam that it built in Afghanistan eight years ago.\n\nThe Salma dam, officially known as India-Afghanistan Friendship Dam, was New Delhi's contribution to a global effort aimed at reconstructing Afghanistan and staving off insurgency.\n\nWith the country having fallen into the hands of the Taliban, India had the choice of leaving it to the militant group or helping to maintain it. The Indian government has chosen the latter, sending a four-member team to the hydropower project, a sign of India's growing engagement with the Taliban.\n\nThe Wire has learned that a four-member team from the Indian public sector company Wapcos is currently visiting Salma Dam, their hydroelectric project built on the Harirud River in a remote part of north-western Afghanistan.\n\nThe team journeyed to Kabul via the weekly scheduled flight on Wednesday, proceeding to Herat city next day. They took a helicopter ride to the dam site, where they stayed for three days before embarking on their return trip. Local security officials and representatives from the Afghan Ministry of Energy and Water accompanied them throughout their visit.\n\nThe weathered name board at the dam site mirrored the evolving political landscape in Afghanistan. Set against a blue backdrop, the inscription \"Afghan India Friendship Dam\" remained prominently displayed, while several other lines had gradually faded. On top, the colours of the Indian flag remained vibrant, accompanied by the symbol of entwined hands. But the tricolour flag of the Afghan republic along the same line seemed to have been deliberately defaced.\n\nIt is understood that the Taliban government has made repeated requests to Indian authorities for the dispatch of a technical team to address longstanding issues at Salma Dam. However, responding to these appeals has been delayed amid diplomatic complexities. This is likely the first visit by any Indian official delegation to Afghanistan related to infrastructure projects since 2021.\n\nJust like the rest of the international community, India does not officially recognise the Taliban government in Afghanistan. However, since Indian diplomats returned to Kabul in 2022, there has been a gradual build-up of engagement with the Taliban, despite the stationed diplomats being formally designated as a technical team focusing on humanitarian assistance. The Taliban has also turned towards regional countries as prospects of formal diplomatic recognition from the UN are dim due to the educational restrictions on women and girls.\n\nDuring Afghanistan's two decade-long republic era, India's active presence in the country was anchored on its development assistance totalling over $2 billion. In that sphere, Salma Dam, later renamed the India-Afghanistan Friendship Dam, has a premier position along with the Afghan parliament building and Zaranj Delaram highway project.\n\nWhile the Ministry of External Affairs appointed state-run Wapcos to execute the project, the state firm contracted the construction to a joint venture of two private firms, SSJV and Angelique limited.\n\nInaugurated jointly by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and then Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in June 2016, it is the first major water infrastructure project in modern Afghanistan in the last 50 years. The project was also diplomatically sensitive as Iran had objected to its construction over concerns that water flow in the river that crossed over into Iranian territory would reduce.\n\nFor a decade, amidst the challenges posed by precarious security conditions and logistical intricacies, the project endured, demanding a ballooning expenditure of Rs 1775.69 crore ($265 million in 2016 exchange rate) to reach completion.\n\nLinked to Herat city by a 165-kilometre earthen road, traversable only under escort of a large convoy of security personnel, the journey consumed seven to eight arduous hours. However, as the security landscape progressively deteriorated in the project's final years, all ground travel was abruptly barred, compelling Indian workers at the site to rely solely on helicopters for transportation.\n\nAfter its commissioning, the dam was handed over to Afghan engineers and technicians who had been trained in India. Over the next few years, teams from Wapcos made occasional visits to the dam for inspections to address initial operational challenges. Meanwhile, in India, the main contractor sued Wapcos for non-payment of dues of over hundreds of crores in a case that has to be still resolved.\n\nAs the Taliban started to relentlessly press their military blitzkrieg in 2021, the fighting became increasingly closer to the site. In July 2021, Taliban entered Chisti Sharif, the nearest town to the dam, and damaged the complex of rooms that Wapcos had built for staff during the construction phase.\n\nOn August 13, the local Taliban commander entered the dam complex after the soldiers surrendered following the Friday prayers. Soon, the white and black Taliban flag fluttered over the dam.\n\nTwo days after, President Ghani and his aides fled to Uzbekistan, allowing the Taliban to seize control of Kabul and the entire country.\n\nSince many of the Afghan engineers had migrated abroad in those uncertain days, the challenge in the new Taliban era was to find trained manpower to operate the hydropower project. In fact, the attrition had begun months prior to the Taliban's assumption of power, as salary payments dwindled owing to the Afghan government's revenue constraints.\n\nThe technical team from Wapcos has gone with a list of items that needed to be assessed. \"The SCADA system, which is the centralised software for controlling the dam, has not been working for years. So that is on the agenda for inspection,\" explained a source, who did not want to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media.\n\nSimilarly, the automatic mechanism for opening and shutting the irrigation sluice gates have been out of action. Besides, several instruments were also on the check list.\n\nAfter their three-day stay, the team, which includes specialists in geology, software and electrical systems, will return to Kabul for talks with Afghan ministry officials. \"This is the best time to inspect the dam as the water level is at its lowest as it is winter,\" said the informed source.\n\nDuring their stay at the dam, the Indian officials lived in the camp accommodation constructed by another Indian public sector company, BHEL for their technicians during construction, as the Wapcos quarters remain in a bombed out condition - a testimony to the tumultuous history that Salma dam has weathered.",

Elections are also approaching, he added.\n\nHowever, this exercise has a noble purpose, he said, praising the 'Gayatri Parivar' for its work and teachings.\n\nIn his comments, Modi emphasised the need to protect the youth from the grip of addiction and provide support to those already affected.\n\n\"Addiction wreaks havoc on individuals and societies, causing immense damage,\" he said, reaffirming the government's commitment to the nationwide initiative for a drug-free India that has engaged with more than 11 crore people since its launch.\n\nHe highlighted the extensive outreach efforts including bike rallies, oath-taking ceremonies and street plays conducted in collaboration with social and religious organisations.\n\nThe integration of the youth with larger national and global initiatives will help them keep away from any addiction, the prime minister said, noting their important role in achieving the goals of a developed and self-reliant India.\n\nIn national and global campaigns, the more the youth is involved, the more they will stay away from the wrong path, he said.\n\nSpeaking on the government's focus on sports and science, Modi said the success of the Chandrayaan mission has sparked a new interest for technology, asserting that such events have a transformative impact in channelling the energy of the youth in the right direction.\n\nHe said initiatives like the Fit India Movement and the Khelo India will motivate the youth and \"a motivated youth cannot turn towards substance abuse\".\n\nReferring to the new organisation 'Mera Yuva Bharat (MY Bharat)', the prime minister said more than 1.5 crore youths have already registered with the portal giving a push to the right use of youth power for nation building.\n\nHe noted that during the 'Pran Pratishtha' (consecration ceremony) at the Ram temple, he had spoken of the beginning of the new journey of a thousand years for India.\n\n\"In this Amrit Kaal, we are witnessing the dawn of this new era,\" Prime Minister Modi said, expressing optimism about India's journey towards becoming a global leader with individual development shaping the national development.",

        "text": "Get latest articles and stories on Latest News at LatestLY. Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) continued their bullish stance on the country's debt markets with a net infusion of over Rs 18,500 crore so far this month, driven by upcoming inclusion of Indian government bonds in the JP Morgan Index.\n\nNew Delhi, Feb 25 (PTI) Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) continued their bullish stance on the country's debt markets with a net infusion of over Rs 18,500 crore so far this month, driven by upcoming inclusion of Indian government bonds in the JP Morgan Index.\n\nThis came following a net investment of over Rs 19,836 crore in January, making it the highest monthly inflow in more than six years. This was the highest inflow since June 2017, when they infused Rs 25,685 crore.\n\nAlso Read | Sudarshan Setu Inauguration: PM Narendra Modi Set To Inaugurate Okha-Beyt Dwarka Signature Bridge on February 25, Know Everything About India's Longest Cable-Stayed Bridge (See Pics and Video).\n\n\"With introduction of India in global bond indices this year, Indian debt inflows should get steady flows going ahead. Also, further front-loading before actual inclusion in June this year is also expected. This is also in line with long-term aim to deepen our underdeveloped debt-markets,\" Kislay Upadhyay, smallcase Manager & Founder Fidelfolio, said.\n\nOn the other hand, foreign investors pulled out Rs 424 crore from equities during the period under review. Before this, they withdrew a massive Rs 25,743 crore in January, data with the depositories showed.\n\nAlso Read | AP TET 2024 Admit Card Released at aptet.apcfss.in: Hall Ticket for Andhra Pradesh State Teacher Eligibility Test Examination Out, Know How To Download.\n\nAccording to the data, FPIs made a net investment of Rs 18,589 crore in the debt markets this month (till February 23 ). With this, the total investment by FPIs reached over Rs 38,426 crore in 2024. They have been injecting money in the debt markets for the past few months.\n\nFPIs infused Rs 18,302 crore in the debt market in December, Rs 14,860 crore in November, and Rs 6,381 crore in October. The upcoming inclusion in JP Morgan EMBIGD in June 2024 is a major driver for the huge inflow in the debt market, Bhuvan Rustagi, Co-Founder and COO, Per Annum and Lendbox, said.\n\nAdditionally, attractive yield, stable macroeconomic indicators and relatively stable rupee too attracted FPIs towards the debt market. JP Morgan Chase & Co. in September last year announced that it will add Indian government bonds to its benchmark emerging market index from June 2024.\n\nThis landmark inclusion is anticipated to benefit India by attracting around USD 20-40 billion in the subsequent 18 to 24 months. This inflow is expected to make Indian bonds more accessible to foreign investors and potentially strengthen the rupee, thereby bolstering the economy.\n\nOn equities front, FPIs pulled out Rs 424 crore so far this month, sharply down from Rs 25,744 crore in January. The resilience of the market is preventing FPIs from selling aggressively despite attractive bond yields in the US, V K Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist, Geojit Financial Services, said.\n\nMaking similar statement, Bharat Dhawan, Managing Partner at Mazars in India, said the Indian market continues to captivate international interest, signifying not only the resilience of the economy but also the trust global investors place in its growth trajectory.\n\nIn terms of sectors, FPI sell-off was significant in the banking sector, as it saw lower-than-expected results in terms of net interest margins due to competition in deposit mobilization, smallcase's Upadhyay said.\n\nOverall, the total FPI flows for 2023 stood at Rs 1.71 lakh crore in equities and Rs 68,663 crore in the debt markets. Together, they infused Rs 2.4 lakh crore into the capital market.\n\nThe flow in Indian equities came following a worst net outflow of Rs 1.21 lakh crore in 2022 on aggressive rate hikes by the central banks globally. Before the outflow, FPIs invested money in the last three years.",

Reminding the Prime Minister of his allegations of corruption against NCP when it was intact, Pawar challenged Modi to constitute an inquiry committee to probe those allegations.\n\n\"Modi had called NCP a corrupt party in his Bhopal rally and made allegations of scam. I challenge him to set up a committee under the supervision of the Supreme Court. We will also support the inquiry and once it is concluded, let that report be out in public. I am confident that he will never initiate that inquiry,\" Pawar said.\n\nBesides Pawar, state Congress president Nana Patole, Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Sachin Ahir, newly elected Rajya Sabha member of Congress Chandrakant Handore and Baramati MP Supriya Sule addressed the rally. Workers of NCP (Sharadchandra Pawar), Congress and Shiv Sena (UBT) attended it.\n\nBlaming BJP over recent action by the central agencies against some of the opposition leaders, Pawar said, \"It targets leaders not aligning with BJP using central agencies. We had never thought in the past that the constitution and the democracy of the country would be in danger. But it is happening today because of the misuse of power by the Narendra Modi-led government.\"\n\nHe said, \"This needs to be stopped and for that, all anti-BJP parties and leaders will have to come together and work in cooperation. All of us will have to go to the people to convince them about how BJP is misusing the power to end democracy. It is the only way to throw them out of power.\"\n\nTargeting the central government over the ongoing protest of farmers on Delhi's borders, Pawar said the government was insensitive towards farmers' issues. \"Our country runs on agriculture. These farmers feed the entire country. They have been protesting for their demands for the last one year, but the Modi government is so insensitive towards them that it is not bothered to resolve their problems,\" the former union agriculture minister said.\n\nPawar also criticised Modi for targeting India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. \"Nehru spent over 10 years in jail during the freedom struggle. Even after the freedom, he adopted a scientific temperament to shape up the country and he set up various institutions. If recent speeches of Modi are heard, it appears as if he has only one agenda and that is to defame Nehru,\" he said.\n\nCongressman Patole targeted both central and state governments over the governance in the country and the state, respectively. \"Modi had given various guarantees, including bringing back black money from abroad, providing two crore employment, waiving off farmers loan, in 2014, but he could not fulfil any of them. The state government had also promised good governance. But in reality, it is using goons to pressurise common people to make them vote for people in power. The common voter will not tolerate it for long and it will vote BJP out of power,\" Patole said.",
