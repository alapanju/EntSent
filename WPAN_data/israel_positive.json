        "text": "Loading...Loading...\n\nOTTAWA, ON, April 11, 2024 /CNW/ - We, Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau and Prime Minister of the French Republic Gabriel Attal, met yesterday and today to deepen the already strong bilateral relations between our two countries, rooted in a shared history, a common language, and universal values, such as democracy and respect for human rights. Canada and France enjoy strong ties through bilateral co-operation in a wide range of areas, from international security to environmental protection, promotion of peace, education, sustainable development, and economic co-operation, both bilaterally and multilaterally within the G7, the G20, NATO, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie, and UN organizations. Our bilateral commitments are also enhanced by strong human exchanges and the significant number of our nationals in each of the two countries.\n\nOur discussions during the past several hours provided an opportunity to advance shared priorities, such as environmental protection, the fight against climate change, the transition to a net-zero economy, energy security, the advancement of rules-based inclusive trade, and an unwavering commitment to promoting the French language and Francophone cultures. We also reaffirmed our commitment to the Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA), which has created significant opportunities for businesses and workers in both Canada and France.\n\nCultural and linguistic ties\n\nThe linguistic and cultural ties shared by Canada and France make us natural partners to promote the French language as a pillar of economic, social, and cultural development, and solidarity among the peoples of the Francophone world. Canada and France benefit from long-standing, strong collaboration in the cultural sector, including in the cultural and creative industries, digital platform regulation, audio-visual co-production, and promotion of the French language. In this regard, we continue to support TV5MONDE and the French-language digital platform TV5MONDEplus to enrich and introduce French-language content around the world. With the passage of the modernized Official Languages Act in 2023, Canada now has strengthened legislation to support its commitment to promoting and protecting French across Canada.\n\nCo-operation between our business communities\n\nWe congratulate the Mouvement des entreprises de France and the Business Council of Canada on signing an agreement establishing a France-Canada Business Council, a structure for critical thinking and regular exchanges between the two organizations, in an effort to strengthen exchanges between French and Canadian businesses to promote the development of trade and economic relations between Canada and France.\n\nWe are pleased to announce the renewal of the agreement between the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) and the French investment bank (Bpifrance) to support the international expansion and success of Canadian and French small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\n\nBDC and Bpifrance, whose mandates have many points in common, have formalized their collaboration and commitment in supporting the success of SMEs. In addition to sharing best practices in entrepreneurship support, BDC and Bpifrance will join forces to develop concrete projects to benefit SMEs, specifically for the purpose of improving access to markets and investors in both countries.\n\nOur co-operation on the environment\n\nFrance and Canada recognize the importance of working together to face the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss. In addition, we are proud to announce the renewal of the Canada-France Climate and Environment Partnership, reiterating our shared commitment to supporting the fight against climate change by promoting and implementing the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn particular, France and Canada will work together to mobilize innovative ways to eradicate poverty and preserve the planet and to better protect vulnerable countries facing the crises stemming from climate change and conflict. Canada and France welcome the Paris Pact for People and the Planet (4P), adopted in June 2023.\n\nWe support reaching a legally binding international agreement to tackle plastic pollution and will continue to work together within the Host Country Alliance of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) process and the High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution. We also emphasize the importance of halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030. As members of the Nature Champions Network and the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People, we will continue our joint efforts to accelerate the momentum and the implementation of the Kunming-Montr\u00e9al Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF).\n\nFrance and Canada will continue to help developing countries contribute to the 23 targets of the Kunming-Montr\u00e9al Global Biodiversity Framework by providing them with an adequate, predictable, and timely flow of funds. The countries emphasize the need to fight against deforestation around the world by preserving, protecting, and restoring critical ecosystems, especially forests and other wooded land, as well as wetlands, such as peatlands, mangroves, and oceans, which are the main natural carbon sinks and biodiversity reservoirs. Canada and France will continue to work together to advance the objectives of the Forest and Climate Leaders' Partnership, which is committed to implementing ambitious actions aligned with the Glasgow Declaration on Forests.\n\nFrance and Canada also recognize that carbon pricing is one of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Canada is pleased to welcome France as a Partner in the Global Carbon Pricing Challenge, which calls for a partnership of carbon pricing champions from around the world to expand the use of carbon pricing by strengthening existing systems and supporting emerging ones. The goal of the Challenge is for 60% of global emissions to be covered by carbon pollution pricing by 2030.\n\nOur co-operation in fighting forest fires\n\nRecently, natural disasters and extreme weather have devastated communities in Canada and in Europe. The forest fires and wildfires in France and Canada in 2022 and 2023 were unprecedented in size and duration. Canada is grateful for the major operational support provided by France in 2023. Given the growing threat of forest fires on populations, infrastructure, and ecosystems, our two countries are taking the necessary measures to formalize our co-operation in wildfire management. By signing a Declaration of Intent, France and Canada will strengthen their collaboration in this regard, notably through personnel exchanges during emergencies, in areas such as innovation, data- and information-sharing, and firefighter training. In co-operation with the Province of British Columbia, we confirm our interest in deploying a French wildfire services expert to enhance our mutual learning.\n\nLastly, France, joining its European partners under the framework established by the European Union, will purchase two De Havilland firefighting aircraft and is also considering further acquisitions to renew its fleet.\n\nOur co-operation in transitioning to clean energy\n\nCanada and France emphasize their support for the Powering Past Coal Alliance and the Coal Transition Accelerator, launched jointly during COP28, and will continue to co-operate within the Alliance and the Accelerator to foster the transition to clean energy. Canada and France acknowledge the importance of promoting sustainable development and the transition to a climate-neutral economy. We welcome investments that support this objective and will work together for transparency and against zero-sum competition in our path toward climate neutrality.\n\nTo work together fully on this transition, Canada and France are today announcing new bilateral co-operation on transportation, in particular decarbonizing aviation and airport activities, railway transportation, decarbonizing the maritime sector, and supply chains. A partnership will be signed to formalize this bilateral initiative.\n\nOur co-operation in Research, Development, and Innovation\n\nTo meet the world's scientific and technological challenges, Canada and France are determined to further their co-operation in innovation and scientific research, particularly in the areas of research, technology and innovation, specifically emerging technologies such as quantum science and artificial intelligence, the poles and oceans, health, and the energy transition.\n\nWe underscore the signing of a memorandum of understanding to create the Franco-Canadian International Research Network (IRN) on hydrogen, coordinated by the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and involving 10 universities from both our countries. This initiative aims to deepen collaborative efforts between Canadian and French researchers to improve low-carbon-emission hydrogen production technologies.\n\nLoading...Loading...\n\nGeopolitical crises\n\nIn our discussion, we also addressed the major geopolitical crises we are facing. Canada and France have worked closely together to mobilize the international community in support of the efforts of Haitians to restore security, rule of law, and democracy. We are deeply concerned about the seriousness of the security crisis and its devastating consequences for the Haitian people. We encourage the Transitional Presidential Council, once in place, to form a government and institutions to restore security and to move as quickly as possible to organize fair, credible, and transparent elections for Haitians. France and Canada call for the rapid deployment of the Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti to assist the Haitian police in fighting organized crime.\n\nCanada and France unequivocally condemn Russia's ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine and remain firmly committed to Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, including its territorial waters. We believe that it is up to Ukraine to decide how to defend itself and protect its people. Canada and France will continue its support bilaterally and through all the international organizations of which they are members. They will continue to support a just and lasting peace for Ukraine under the peace plan and its working groups, as well as any other forums where they can exercise their influence.

We will continue our financial, humanitarian, military, and diplomatic support to Ukraine for as long as it takes. We reaffirm our long-term support for Ukraine under the G7 Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine and the respective bilateral agreements that were recently adopted in 2024. Canada and France are determined to help with the recovery and reconstruction of Ukraine by responding to immediate humanitarian needs, supporting reform and anti-corruption efforts, and strengthening trade investment in Ukraine with a view to fostering private-sector participation.\n\nCanada and France are extremely concerned about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the appalling situation of the civilian population. We condemn the strike that resulted in the deaths of several World Central Kitchen workers, including a Canadian citizen. Canada and France emphasize Israel's obligation, under international humanitarian law, to allow and facilitate the unfettered access of humanitarian aid to Gaza and to protect humanitarian workers and the civilian population. We have been clear: an urgent ceasefire is needed. In the strongest possible terms, we condemn the terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas against Israel on October 7 and call for the immediate, unconditional release of all hostages. Canada and France remain strongly committed to the two-state solution, which includes the creation of a Palestinian state, living in peace and security alongside Israel.\n\nEighty years ago, the Allied armed forces, namely the Canadian Armed Forces and the Free French Forces, took part in the Normandy Landing. We stood firm in the face of tyranny. Although the price to pay was high, our determination to defend the cause of freedom never wavered. Normandy will go down in history as a major turning point in the fight against the Nazis. Its name will be forever associated with bravery and freedom.\n\nToday, we have come together at Beechwood Cemetery for the 80th anniversary of the Normandy Landing to honour the fallen members of the Canadian Forces who fought for France, Europe, and our democracies. We have also inaugurated the Amicitia Monument, with an eye on the future, celebrating Canada-France friendship.\n\nThe first Franco-Canadian Council of Ministers to be held this year in Canada\n\nFaced with the ever-increasing global challenges, France and Canada will continue their close co-operation.

This Council of Ministers will meet for the first time to take stock of our strengthened co-operation and develop joint actions.\n\nThe next Sommet de la Francophonie\n\nWe will have the opportunity to further our steadfast and shared commitment to the French language and Francophone cultures at the next Sommet de la Francophonie. The event will bring together Heads of State and government from la Francophonie on October 4 and 5, 2024, in Paris and Villers-Cotter\u00eats, at the Cit\u00e9 internationale de la langue fran\u00e7aise, on the theme \"Create, innovate, and do business in French.\" We look forward to working together and with all the other partners in advancing our shared priorities, such as the teaching of French and instruction in French, and strengthening democracy and human rights, gender equality, digital and economic co-operation, climate action, and the active participation of civil society and youth.\n\nThis document is also available at http://pm.gc.ca\n\nSOURCE Prime Minister's Office\n\nLoading...Loading...",

In addition to sharing best practices in entrepreneurship support, BDC and Bpifrance will join forces to develop concrete projects to benefit SMEs, specifically for the purpose of improving access to markets and investors in both countries.\n\nOur co-operation on the environment\n\nFrance and Canada recognize the importance of working together to face the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss. In addition, we are proud to announce the renewal of the Canada-France Climate and Environment Partnership, reiterating our shared commitment to supporting the fight against climate change by promoting and implementing the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn particular, France and Canada will work together to mobilize innovative ways to eradicate poverty and preserve the planet and to better protect vulnerable countries facing the crises stemming from climate change and conflict. Canada and France welcome the Paris Pact for People and the Planet (4P), adopted in June 2023.\n\nWe support reaching a legally binding international agreement to tackle plastic pollution and will continue to work together within the Host Country Alliance of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) process and the High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution. We also emphasize the importance of halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030. As members of the Nature Champions Network and the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People, we will continue our joint efforts to accelerate the momentum and the implementation of the Kunming\u2011Montr\u00e9al Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF).\n\nFrance and Canada will continue to help developing countries contribute to the 23 targets of the Kunming-Montr\u00e9al Global Biodiversity Framework by providing them with an adequate, predictable, and timely flow of funds. The countries emphasize the need to fight against deforestation around the world by preserving, protecting, and restoring critical ecosystems, especially forests and other wooded land, as well as wetlands, such as peatlands, mangroves, and oceans, which are the main natural carbon sinks and biodiversity reservoirs. Canada and France will continue to work together to advance the objectives of the Forest and Climate Leaders' Partnership, which is committed to implementing ambitious actions aligned with the Glasgow Declaration on Forests.\n\nFrance and Canada also recognize that carbon pricing is one of the most effective ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Canada is pleased to welcome France as a Partner in the Global Carbon Pricing Challenge, which calls for a partnership of carbon pricing champions from around the world to expand the use of carbon pricing by strengthening existing systems and supporting emerging ones. The goal of the Challenge is for 60% of global emissions to be covered by carbon pollution pricing by 2030.\n\nOur co-operation in fighting forest fires\n\nRecently, natural disasters and extreme weather have devastated communities in Canada and in Europe. The forest fires and wildfires in France and Canada in 2022 and 2023 were unprecedented in size and duration. Canada is grateful for the major operational support provided by France in 2023. Given the growing threat of forest fires on populations, infrastructure, and ecosystems, our two countries are taking the necessary measures to formalize our co-operation in wildfire management. By signing a Declaration of Intent, France and Canada will strengthen their collaboration in this regard, notably through personnel exchanges during emergencies, in areas such as innovation, data- and information-sharing, and firefighter training. In co-operation with the Province of British Columbia, we confirm our interest in deploying a French wildfire services expert to enhance our mutual learning.\n\nLastly, France, joining its European partners under the framework established by the European Union, will purchase two De Havilland firefighting aircraft and is also considering further acquisitions to renew its fleet.\n\nOur co-operation in transitioning to clean energy\n\nCanada and France emphasize their support for the Powering Past Coal Alliance and the Coal Transition Accelerator, launched jointly during COP28, and will continue to co-operate within the Alliance and the Accelerator to foster the transition to clean energy. Canada and France acknowledge the importance of promoting sustainable development and the transition to a climate-neutral economy. We welcome investments that support this objective and will work together for transparency and against zero-sum competition in our path toward climate neutrality.\n\nTo work together fully on this transition, Canada and France are today announcing new bilateral co-operation on transportation, in particular decarbonizing aviation and airport activities, railway transportation, decarbonizing the maritime sector, and supply chains. A partnership will be signed to formalize this bilateral initiative.\n\nOur co-operation in Research, Development, and Innovation\n\nTo meet the world's scientific and technological challenges, Canada and France are determined to further their co-operation in innovation and scientific research, particularly in the areas of research, technology and innovation, specifically emerging technologies such as quantum science and artificial intelligence, the poles and oceans, health, and the energy transition.\n\nWe underscore the signing of a memorandum of understanding to create the Franco-Canadian International Research Network (IRN) on hydrogen, coordinated by the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) and involving 10 universities from both our countries. This initiative aims to deepen collaborative efforts between Canadian and French researchers to improve low-carbon-emission hydrogen production technologies.\n\nGeopolitical crises\n\nIn our discussion, we also addressed the major geopolitical crises we are facing. Canada and France have worked closely together to mobilize the international community in support of the efforts of Haitians to restore security, rule of law, and democracy. We are deeply concerned about the seriousness of the security crisis and its devastating consequences for the Haitian people. We encourage the Transitional Presidential Council, once in place, to form a government and institutions to restore security and to move as quickly as possible to organize fair, credible, and transparent elections for Haitians. France and Canada call for the rapid deployment of the Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti to assist the Haitian police in fighting organized crime.\n\nCanada and France unequivocally condemn Russia's ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine and remain firmly committed to Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders, including its territorial waters. We believe that it is up to Ukraine to decide how to defend itself and protect its people. Canada and France will continue its support bilaterally and through all the international organizations of which they are members. They will continue to support a just and lasting peace for Ukraine under the peace plan and its working groups, as well as any other forums where they can exercise their influence. Canada and France will continue their efforts in the International Coalition for the Return of Ukrainian Children. We will continue our financial, humanitarian, military, and diplomatic support to Ukraine for as long as it takes. We reaffirm our long-term support for Ukraine under the G7 Joint Declaration of Support for Ukraine and the respective bilateral agreements that were recently adopted in 2024. Canada and France are determined to help with the recovery and reconstruction of Ukraine by responding to immediate humanitarian needs, supporting reform and anti-corruption efforts, and strengthening trade investment in Ukraine with a view to fostering private-sector participation.\n\nCanada and France are extremely concerned about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and the appalling situation of the civilian population. We condemn the strike that resulted in the deaths of several World Central Kitchen workers, including a Canadian citizen. Canada and France emphasize Israel's obligation, under international humanitarian law, to allow and facilitate the unfettered access of humanitarian aid to Gaza and to protect humanitarian workers and the civilian population. We have been clear: an urgent ceasefire is needed. In the strongest possible terms, we condemn the terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas against Israel on October 7 and call for the immediate, unconditional release of all hostages. Canada and France remain strongly committed to the two-state solution, which includes the creation of a Palestinian state, living in peace and security alongside Israel.\n\nEighty years ago, the Allied armed forces, namely the Canadian Armed Forces and the Free French Forces, took part in the Normandy Landing. We stood firm in the face of tyranny. Although the price to pay was high, our determination to defend the cause of freedom never wavered. Normandy will go down in history as a major turning point in the fight against the Nazis. Its name will be forever associated with bravery and freedom.\n\nToday, we have come together at Beechwood Cemetery for the 80th anniversary of the Normandy Landing to honour the fallen members of the Canadian Forces who fought for France, Europe, and our democracies. We have also inaugurated the Amicitia Monument, with an eye on the future, celebrating Canada-France friendship.\n\nThe first Franco-Canadian Council of Ministers to be held this year in Canada\n\nFaced with the ever-increasing global challenges, France and Canada will continue their close co-operation. We are pleased to announce the first Franco-Canadian Council of Ministers to be held in Canada's Acadie this year with the President of the French Republic and the Prime Minister of Canada. This Council of Ministers will meet for the first time to take stock of our strengthened co-operation and develop joint actions.\n\nThe next Sommet de la Francophonie\n\nWe will have the opportunity to further our steadfast and shared commitment to the French language and Francophone cultures at the next Sommet de la Francophonie. The event will bring together Heads of State and government from la Francophonie on October 4 and 5, 2024, in Paris and Villers-Cotter\u00eats, at the Cit\u00e9 internationale de la langue fran\u00e7aise, on the theme \"Create, innovate, and do business in French.\" We look forward to working together and with all the other partners in advancing our shared priorities, such as the teaching of French and instruction in French, and strengthening democracy and human rights, gender equality, digital and economic co-operation, climate action, and the active participation of civil society and youth.",

        "text": "OTTAWA -- Former conservative Prime Ministers Boris Johnson of the U.K. and Tony Abbott of Australia predict their Canadian partisan cousins are on their way to win the next federal election.\n\n\"It's fantastic to be here in Canada, where we're just seeing incredible sense that the Conservative Party is not only resurgent, but is poised for victory,\" Mr. Johnston said on the opening day of the Canada Strong & Free Network 2024 in Ottawa on April 10. Mr. Johnston was leader of the British Conservative Party from and prime minister of the UK from 2019 to 2022.\n\nMr. Abbott, wo was the leader of Australia's right-leaning Liberal Party from 2009 to 2015 and prime minister from 2013 to 2015, shared a similar sentiment.\n\n\"It's great to see the Canadian Conservatives looking like you're on the verge of a great win,\" he said. During the event, Mr. Abbott said the Liberal Party is the \"conservative party in Australia.\"\n\nWe support the family, small business, and institutions that have stood the test of time, but above all else, as patriots, we believe that our country is the best place on earth to live,\" Mr. Abbott said.\n\n\"we are the patriot party, and that is why if we are true to ourselves, we should be the natural party of government.\"\n\nMr. Johnson also said that the value put on freedom is what sets conservative parties apart from others.\n\n\"What we need to do is keep supporting Ukraine ... that, I believe, should be the conservative position around the world,\" Mr. Johnson said.\n\nMr. Abbott agreed that the West needs to continue supporting Ukraine, and said the country needs to be allowed to eventually join NATO.\n\n\"The only way that smaller countries can be secure against much larger and fairly aggressive countries is through collective security,\" he said.\n\nWhen it came to Israel's ongoing war against Hamas in Gaza, Mr. Abbott said the conflict was resulting in the \"world's oldest prejudice, anti-Semitism\" rising around the world. He also said there was a \"kind of quasi-Marxism\" emerging among many on the left, which \"sees the whole world in terms of oppressors and oppressed and the Israelis have somehow become the oppressors, and the Gazans are somehow the oppressed.\"\n\nMr. Johnson said while he used to be a \"massive climate change skeptic,\" he had since been convinced by scientists that there was a need to use technology to reduce global emissions. He said conservatives needed to show that the \"green agenda\" could also produce good-paying jobs.\n\n\"I want the Green Revolution, which means jobs and growth in the UK. I do believe that,\" he said.\n\nDuring his tenure, Mr. Johnson committed to net-zero goals and has urged current Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to stay on the same course.\n\nBut Mr. Abbott said there was no \"climate emergency\" and warned that trying to remake the global economy in order to reduce emissions to zero by a set deadline was \"folly of the First Order.\"\n\n\"The green agenda has given us much higher power prices and in the process we have effectively de-industrialized by exporting most of our emissions-intensive industries to countries which are less fastidious about this,\" he said.\n\n\"The truth is that everyone wants to save the planet, we have got the idea that we should impose massive costs on our citizens ... it's simply crackers.\"",

        "title": "Brazil Potash Receives Mine Installation License to Start Project Construction of the Autazes Potash Project in Brazil",
        "text": "Loading...Loading...GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF AMAZONAS ANNOUNCES ISSUANCE OF MINE INSTALLATION LICENSE AFTER ALL REGULATORY FILINGS AND INDIGENOUS CONSULTATIONS COMPLETED HISTORICAL STEP FOR BRAZIL TO MATERIALLY REDUCE DEPENDENCE ON IMPORTED POTASH AS ALL POTASH PLANNED TO BE SOLD DOMESTICALLYPROJECT TO INITIALLY PRODUCE 2.4 MILLION TONS PER YEAR WITH ABILITY TO INCREASE PRODUCTIONSTRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP WITH AMMAGI FOR OFFTAKE AND DISTRIBUTION SIGNEDPROJECT REDUCES GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY ~1.4 MILLION TONS PER YEAR\n\nMANAUS, Brazil, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brazil Potash Corp. (\"Brazil Potash\" or the \"Company\") is excited to announce the Amazon State Environmental Protection Institute (IPAAM), has granted the mine Installation License for the Autazes Potash Project (the \"Project\") to the 100% owned Brazilian subsidiary Potassio do Brasil, allowing for construction to commence. This is a major milestone in the Company's development and follows several years of environmental, social, and technical studies as well as the successful completion of local Indigenous People's 'free, prior, and informed consultations'.\n\nBrazil Potash's mine Installation License was granted at a ceremony organized by Amazon State Governor Wilson Lima, and attended by IPAAM President Juliano Valente, State Deputy Sinesio Campos, Pot\u00e1ssio do Brasil President Adriano Espeschit, several other government officials, and major press outlets recognizing the importance of establishing a sustainable domestic source of potash in Brazil for global food security. The Company expects to start construction with the awarding of contracts for mine surface works and shaft construction.\n\nTadeu de Souza - Amazonas Vice Governor, Wilson Lima - Amazonas Governor, Anderson Cavalcante - Mayor Autazes, Silas Camara - Federal Deputy, Sin\u00e9sio Campos - State Deputy, Ronney Peixoto - Mining Secretary of State, Kleber Mura - CIM Coordinator General\n\nLoading...Loading...\n\nExtensive media attendance at license grant ceremony\n\nBRAZIL AND THE NEED FOR FERTILIZERS\n\nGlobal food security depends on the continued success of Brazilian agricultural exports. The country is a leading producer and exporter of orange juice, soybeans, corn, sugar and cotton as well as beef, poultry and pork. Abundant arable land, good year-round weather and efficient farming have made Brazilian farmers among the most productive globally, contributing roughly 30% to Brazil's GDP. Critical to Brazil's continuing productivity is access to affordable fertilizers. However, Brazil is highly exposed as it imports 85% of its fertilizer needs including 98% of its potash, half of which comes from countries currently at war or sanctioned, including Russia, Belarus, and Israel, when a massive potash basin exists in its own backyard. Now, with the License approval, Brazil can produce this essential mineral for its farmers in country, by-passing the risk and costs of imports. Potash is extremely important to efficiently grow food as it strengthens the stem of plants to make them more resilient to stresses caused by drought, extreme temperatures, and insect infestation.\n\nABOUT BRAZIL POTASH. GAME CHANGER FOR BRAZIL AND THE WORLD FOR FOOD SECURITY\n\nBrazil Potash's Autazes deposit can be mined and processed, using proven off the shelf environmentally friendly technology, to extract the ore using room and pillar mining, separate out the potash using hot water and return the remaining material (sodium chloride tailings) back underground. From an environmental perspective, this project has positive greenhouse gas credentials considering it will operate with predominantly green produced electric energy (Brazil has 84%+ renewable energy in its grid). Production in country also eliminates 12,000 to 20,000 kilometers of shipping to reach Brazil's large soybean farmers in Mato Grosso resulting in clear benefits to Brazil and for global food security.\n\n\"We are thrilled to receive the mine installation license from the Amazon State Environmental Protection Institute. For several years, Brazil Potash has been waiting for this moment to show that is possible to have a sustainable mining operation in the Amazon region. With the Autazes Potash Project's support from the Mura Indigenous people, we can show the world that it is possible to have more development for local communities with a better quality of life. This truly marks a win-win for Brazil's economy, its people, and the world,\" said Adriano Espeschit, President of Pot\u00e1ssio do Brasil.\n\nBrazil Potash's CEO, Matt Simpson, commented, \"I am very proud of the years of permitting, indigenous, government, and community relations work completed by our team in Brazil headed by our President Adriano Espeschit, which has resulting in securing the mine Installation License. This is a major milestone to advance and derisk the development of the Autazes Potash Project as we move closer to the start of project construction\".\n\nEXTENSIVE USE OF GREEN ENERGY AND POSITIVE SOCIAL IMPACT\n\nBrazil Potash will have a positive impact on the economy and environment of the Amazonas state by reducing green house gases by ~1.4 million tons per year. The Company will create an estimated 10,000 new jobs and will be largest contributor to the GDP for the state of Amazonas. In addition, the project will produce potash locally and sell it in local currency thus saving Brazil roughly US$1 billion in currency outflows.

        "text": "GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF AMAZONAS ANNOUNCES ISSUANCE OF MINE INSTALLATION LICENSE AFTER ALL REGULATORY FILINGS AND INDIGENOUS CONSULTATIONS COMPLETED HISTORICAL STEP FOR BRAZIL TO MATERIALLY REDUCE DEPENDENCE ON IMPORTED POTASH AS ALL POTASH PLANNED TO BE SOLD DOMESTICALLYPROJECT TO INITIALLY PRODUCE 2.4 MILLION TONS PER YEAR WITH ABILITY TO INCREASE PRODUCTIONSTRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP WITH AMMAGI FOR OFFTAKE AND DISTRIBUTION SIGNEDPROJECT REDUCES GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY ~1.4 MILLION TONS PER YEAR\n\nMANAUS, Brazil, April 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Brazil Potash Corp. (\"Brazil Potash\" or the \"Company\") is excited to announce the Amazon State Environmental Protection Institute (IPAAM), has granted the mine Installation License for the Autazes Potash Project (the \"Project\") to the 100% owned Brazilian subsidiary Potassio do Brasil, allowing for construction to commence. This is a major milestone in the Company's development and follows several years of environmental, social, and technical studies as well as the successful completion of local Indigenous People's 'free, prior, and informed consultations'.\n\nBrazil Potash's mine Installation License was granted at a ceremony organized by Amazon State Governor Wilson Lima, and attended by IPAAM President Juliano Valente, State Deputy Sinesio Campos, Pot\u00e1ssio do Brasil President Adriano Espeschit, several other government officials, and major press outlets recognizing the importance of establishing a sustainable domestic source of potash in Brazil for global food security. The Company expects to start construction with the awarding of contracts for mine surface works and shaft construction.\n\nTadeu de Souza - Amazonas Vice Governor, Wilson Lima - Amazonas Governor, Anderson Cavalcante - Mayor Autazes, Silas Camara - Federal Deputy, Sin\u00e9sio Campos - State Deputy, Ronney Peixoto - Mining Secretary of State, Kleber Mura - CIM Coordinator General\n\nExtensive media attendance at license grant ceremony\n\nBRAZIL AND THE NEED FOR FERTILIZERS\n\nGlobal food security depends on the continued success of Brazilian agricultural exports. The country is a leading producer and exporter of orange juice, soybeans, corn, sugar and cotton as well as beef, poultry and pork. Abundant arable land, good year-round weather and efficient farming have made Brazilian farmers among the most productive globally, contributing roughly 30% to Brazil's GDP. Critical to Brazil's continuing productivity is access to affordable fertilizers. However, Brazil is highly exposed as it imports 85% of its fertilizer needs including 98% of its potash, half of which comes from countries currently at war or sanctioned, including Russia, Belarus, and Israel, when a massive potash basin exists in its own backyard. Now, with the License approval, Brazil can produce this essential mineral for its farmers in country, by-passing the risk and costs of imports. Potash is extremely important to efficiently grow food as it strengthens the stem of plants to make them more resilient to stresses caused by drought, extreme temperatures, and insect infestation.\n\nABOUT BRAZIL POTASH. GAME CHANGER FOR BRAZIL AND THE WORLD FOR FOOD SECURITY\n\nBrazil Potash's Autazes deposit can be mined and processed, using proven off the shelf environmentally friendly technology, to extract the ore using room and pillar mining, separate out the potash using hot water and return the remaining material (sodium chloride tailings) back underground. From an environmental perspective, this project has positive greenhouse gas credentials considering it will operate with predominantly green produced electric energy (Brazil has 84%+ renewable energy in its grid). Production in country also eliminates 12,000 to 20,000 kilometers of shipping to reach Brazil's large soybean farmers in Mato Grosso resulting in clear benefits to Brazil and for global food security.\n\n\"We are thrilled to receive the mine installation license from the Amazon State Environmental Protection Institute. For several years, Brazil Potash has been waiting for this moment to show that is possible to have a sustainable mining operation in the Amazon region. With the Autazes Potash Project's support from the Mura Indigenous people, we can show the world that it is possible to have more development for local communities with a better quality of life. This truly marks a win-win for Brazil's economy, its people, and the world,\" said Adriano Espeschit, President of Pot\u00e1ssio do Brasil.\n\nBrazil Potash's CEO, Matt Simpson, commented, \"I am very proud of the years of permitting, indigenous, government, and community relations work completed by our team in Brazil headed by our President Adriano Espeschit, which has resulting in securing the mine Installation License. This is a major milestone to advance and derisk the development of the Autazes Potash Project as we move closer to the start of project construction\".\n\nEXTENSIVE USE OF GREEN ENERGY AND POSITIVE SOCIAL IMPACT\n\nBrazil Potash will have a positive impact on the economy and environment of the Amazonas state by reducing green house gases by ~1.4 million tons per year. The Company will create an estimated 10,000 new jobs and will be largest contributor to the GDP for the state of Amazonas. In addition, the project will produce potash locally and sell it in local currency thus saving Brazil roughly US$1 billion in currency outflows.

The studies explore the best proposed implementation sites for commercial installations, and reviews 77 sites in-detail in the U.S. coastline, in terms of wave availability and compatible marine structures, with encouraging results, while also proposing a five and a ten years roadmap for wave energy commercialization.\n\n\"Wave energy can power communities with clean, reliable energy and be a strong force in combating climate change,\" said Eco Wave Power Founder & CEO Inna Braverman. \"We are thrilled to help provide in depth analysis about wave energy to an industry leader that is\n\nexploring many avenues for clean energy.\"\n\nSince its establishment, Eco Wave Power has rapidly changed the landscape of the ocean energy industry. Through a decade of relentless innovation, Eco Wave Power has built and demonstrated the scalability and reliability of its technology with various power stations. Just few months ago, Eco Wave Power announced that its landmark EWP-EDF One power station in Jaffa Port is officially connected to the grid, providing power from wave energy to Israel's national energy grid for the first time.\n\nEco Wave Power also has a pilot station located at AltaSea at the Port of Los Angeles. Currently on static display, the station is set to be installed in the coming months and will be the first onshore wave energy pilot station in the United States.\n\nRecently, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed new legislation, Senate Bill 605, that directs the California Energy Commission to evaluate the feasibility of wave and tidal energy in California, including the costs and benefits of implementing the technology across the state's coastline. In New Jersey, similar legislation is awaiting consideration from the New Jersey State Senate Environment & Energy Committee.\n\nThe United States Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that wave energy in the United States alone has the technical resource potential to produce over 1,400 TWh/year - enough to power 130,000,000 homes.\n\nResearch more water stocks with Investorideas free stock directory\n\nInvestorideas is the go-to platform for big investing ideas.

        "title": "THE FABRIC OF EID",
        "text": "Stitching Together Love, Generosity, and Nostalgia\n\nBy: Ikkz Ikbal\n\nEid-Ul-Fitr is celebrated after Muslims across the globe complete the holy month of Ramadan. While across cultures, the traditions may differ, there's a unanimous way of enjoying and celebratingthe occasion with family, friends and great food. A symphony of joy and anticipation fills the hearts of millions around the world. For me, Eid has always been more than just a celebration; laced with strands of love, generosity, and nostalgia.\n\nThe happiness is starting your EID with the sweet embrace of tradition, by wishing Eid greetings to your MUMMY first. Expressing love and gratitude to the person who has supported and loved me throughout the years brings me an unmatched sense of delight in the morning. And then what a better way to kick-start the Eid celebrations when you know Mummy still shares the traditional delights like \"GHAR CHE GOV HUND DOUD\" (milk from the cow we own) with our dear neighbors on Eid morning. It's a gesture that embodies the idea of unity and sharing while also fostering a sense of community.\n\nHowever, the real charm of Eid is found in the small joys, such as starting Eid day with lepton chai (sweet tea) and cookies. Its warmth brings back memories of childhood jokes and close family ties. These Eid customs act as anchors, bringing us back to earth in a world full of memories and love. And the happiness was in celebrating Eid with family and friends, surrounded by laughter and love. It always feels cool to be together, sharing in the joy of the occasion.\n\nEid, for me, is a journey down memory lane, filled with happy memories of carefree childhood moments and unbridled joy. Eid for me as a child always began the previous evening, once the moon was sighted. The anticipation was building as we were eagerly waiting for the announcement of the moon sighting for Eid. Whatever\n\nAnd then, the anticipation builds as we eagerly await the announcement of the moon sighting for Eid. And whatever decision may had come, whether Eid falls on the 29th day of Ramadan or not, I always wished Eid after 29th day of Ramadan for no reason.\n\nAnd then the happiness of collecting Eidi, a token of gift given by our elders on Eid.Eidi wasn't just the amount for me, but the excitement of collecting it from all the older family members and putting it in the piggie bank.\n\nThe tradition of giving Eidi still continues but has undergone a major change _ both in terms of purchasing power of elders and the expectations of children.\n\nAnd the happiness of Eid Shopping with family.This one's the least cool of them all. I'm sure you all remember getting excited about going down to the mall and trying on new clothes. I'm sure you also remember taking pictures in this 'exciting' attire. And I remember, when we can't afford to buy any thing in the shop, Dad would be like, \"Thaav Hex TaamAetii, AesYemovGuddeYoure\" (Keep It There, We'll Be Back)\n\nAnd the happiness was also in not bargaining with someone who is working hard and trying to earn his daily bread. Feels great indeed. It is a humble experience that makes you realize how important it is to show a helping hand and spread love unconditionally.\n\nAfter a month of fasting and spiritual introspection during the holy month of Ramadan, Eid-Ul-Fitr unites people from all cultural backgrounds in a celebration of food, family, and friendship. It's a moment to celebrate diversity's richness, to welcome both new and old customs, and to value the ties that bind us together.\n\nOn this occasion of Eid, let's not only enjoy the celebrations but also embrace the spirit of generosity and compassion. For you, this Eid day may be a day of happiness and celebration, but there are many in our community who may have this day the same as the other 365 days. Let's happily extend a helping hand to those in need. Reach the children who are waiting to celebrate this day. Let's share Love, Laughter and Learning together with friends, family and everyone around, and add kindness and unity to the tapestry of Eid.\n\nLet this Eid-Ul-Fitr serve as a reminder of the value of compassion, empathy and unity, not just within our close circles but also towards those who might be going through difficulties of the times.

She shared her work, along with stories about the importance of microorganisms in our world, on Instagram, launching #MicrobeMondays and later #MicroMartes to share content in Spanish. Through her crafting and social media engagement, Porras reached groups historically underrepresented in microbiology - women and U.S.-based Spanish speakers. Her platform also became a space for her audience to learn more about COVID during the 2020 pandemic, with Porras answering questions and hosting interviews with other scientists.\n\nHer social media engagement has led to other outreach, including writing an article about the importance of science communication in multiple languages, serving on the organizing committee for the InclusiveSciComm symposium, and working with the podcast Story Collider to produce their first \"Stories of Science\" show in Spanish. Porras has also worked directly with young people as a volunteer with Science Clubs Colombia, an organization in her home country that puts on project-oriented, STEM-focused workshops for children.\n\nSaid Porras, \"Historically, the AAAS Early Career Award in Public Engagement with Science has recognized outstanding work by innovative leaders who also center the community in their work. I am deeply honored to have my work recognized next to theirs and thankful for the many collaborators and communities I have had the privilege to collaborate with during the last six years. In particular, I am excited that, through my work, the AAAS is recognizing the importance of multilingual public engagement, both nationally and globally.\"\n\nTareq Abu Hamed, executive director of the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies in Israel, receives the 2024 AAAS David and Betty Hamburg Award for Science Diplomacy for his leadership in using science to build relationships across the Middle East, particularly between Israelis and Palestinians, to work together to address mutual environmental concerns.\n\nThe award recognizes an individual or a small group working together in the scientific, engineering or foreign affairs communities making an outstanding contribution to furthering science diplomacy. First established in 1992 as the International Scientific Cooperation Award, AAAS renamed its Award for Science Diplomacy in 2021 for David and Betty Hamburg, who championed science diplomacy throughout their careers in science and medicine as a means of advancing science, human rights, peace and cooperation.\n\nAbu Hamed is a graduate of universities in Turkey and Israel, holds a Ph.D. in chemical engineering and is the first Palestinian to head an academic institute in Israel. As the executive director of the Arava Institute for Environmental Studies, Abu Hamed builds trust and fosters cooperation to address the effects of the climate crisis on vulnerable communities. His career at AIES has also seen him lead the Transboundary Renewable Energy Working Group, through which he brought together experts from Israel, the West Bank, Gaza and Jordan to work on socially impactful renewable technology projects. As the director of the Center for Renewable Energy, he was involved in small-scale renewable energy projects in the region. He has mentored students as the academic director for AIES, which is a key pathway for Palestinian and Jordanian students into Israel postgraduate programs. As AIES leader, a role he has held since 2021, Abu Hamed launched the Center for Climate Change Policy and Research.\n\nOutside of his work at AIES, Abu Hamed was the highest-ranking Palestinian in the Israeli government when he served first as deputy chief scientist, then acting chief scientist of Israel's Ministry of Science, Technology and Space in 2015 and 2016. He co-chairs the Regional Cooperation and Security Task Force of Israel's Climate Forum to promote regional and international collaboration on climate change. Abu Hamed served as a member of the Israeli government delegation to COP26: the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) and led a delegation to COP27 that featured an Israeli, a Palestinian and a Jordanian.\n\n\"I am genuinely honored to receive the 2024 AAAS David and Betty Hamburg Award,\" said Abu Hamed. \"This recognition reinforces my belief that we must hold onto hope in the face of incredibly difficult circumstances. The Arava Institute remains unwavering in our commitment to advance peace and sustainability through science diplomacy and cross-border environmental cooperation. It is this approach that will allow us to rise above conflict and ultimately deliver a better future for the region and the world.\"\n\nFor his longstanding commitment to advancing diversity in the chemical sciences through recruitment and mentoring of students from groups traditionally underrepresented in science, Luis A. Col\u00f3n is the recipient of the 2024 AAAS Lifetime Mentor Award.\n\nThe Lifetime Mentor Award honors an individual with more than 25 years of experience who has mentored significant numbers of underrepresented students: women of all backgrounds, men from underrepresented minority groups (African American, Native American and Hispanic) and people with disabilities. Winners also must have demonstrated scholarship, activism and community-building on behalf of underrepresented groups in STEM.\n\nSince 1995, Col\u00f3n has worked to recruit students from his undergraduate alma mater - the University of Puerto Rico at Cayey - to conduct research at the University at Buffalo. By building relationships with Hispanic-serving institutions, hosting recruitment visits, tailoring research projects to students' own interests and a deep level of personal mentoring, Col\u00f3n has created a diverse research community in a department that previously had no Hispanic representation. Since the program's inception, more than 100 students have taken part in his summer internships, and a number of other institutions have replicated Col\u00f3n's model.\n\nHe has also been instrumental in creating an inclusive institutional culture at University at Buffalo, where he serves as SUNY Distinguished Professor, A. Conger Goodyear Professor of Chemistry and associate dean for inclusive excellence in the College of Arts and Sciences. In 2013, he founded the Institute for Strategic Enhancement of Educational Diversity to create an inclusive community for students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty and staff.\n\nCol\u00f3n has directly mentored 51 graduate students, the majority of whom hail from underrepresented groups, but his impacts are even more widely felt. One peer who nominated Col\u00f3n for the Lifetime Mentor Award estimated that more than one-third of faculty members from underrepresented groups hired in chemistry departments in recent years have a connection to Col\u00f3n's program or those it inspired.\n\n\"This award reaffirms my conviction that providing opportunity, guidance, and sharing knowledge in a supportive environment can be reassuring and empowering to advance science,\" said Col\u00f3n. \"It also gives me a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction that former students and professional colleagues recognize the importance of the lifetime commitment of a mentor.\"\n\nEric Stover is the recipient of the 2024 AAAS Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility. Stover, the faculty director of the Human Rights Center at the University of California Berkeley School of Law and adjunct professor of law and public health, is honored for his work that combines pioneering scientific methods and technology with a commitment to human rights to hold accountable perpetrators of mass human rights violations and advance justice for their victims.\n\nThe award honors scientists, engineers or their organizations whose exemplary actions have demonstrated scientific freedom and/or responsibility in challenging circumstances. Actions worthy of the award can include acting to protect public health or safety, focusing public attention on potential impacts of science and technology, or defending the professional freedom of scientists and engineers. The award can honor a lifetime of service or a particular act that demonstrates the value of scientific freedom and responsibility.\n\nStover has led forensic investigations of mass graves in Argentina, Guatemala, Honduras, Chile, Brazil, Iraq, El Salvador, Bosnia, Croatia and Rwanda. Stover is also a founding member of the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, the organization that received the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize. His work in the Balkans helped lead to the conviction of the perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre. His work in Uganda has led to the establishment of a school for girls and women who were victims of the Lord's Resistance Army. Early in his career, he headed the AAAS Science and Human Rights program. While that portion of his career cannot be considered for the award, his nominators noted the impact and illustriousness of the many other activities advancing human rights through science.\n\n\"I am deeply honored and grateful for this award,\" said Stover. \"Back in the 1980s, it was a privilege working at the AAAS with forensic scientists, geneticists, and health professionals worldwide to introduce scientific methods and procedures into war crimes and human rights investigations. These collaborations helped families of the disappeared find their missing loved ones and pursue justice and accountability for these crimes.\"\n\nAn interdisciplinary team of more than 80 researchers led by Indigenous scholars has received the 2024 AAAS Newcomb Cleveland Prize for an article that showcased findings about the rapid spread of horses through Indigenous societies in North America.\n\nThe AAAS Newcomb Cleveland Prize, supported by The Fodor Family Trust, was established in 1923 and is awarded annually to the author or authors of an outstanding paper published in the Research Articles or Reports sections of Science. Recipients of the award, the oldest awarded by AAAS, collectively receive $25,000.\n\n\"Early dispersal of domestic horses into the Great Plains and Northern Rockies\" was published in the March 31, 2023, issue of Science.\n\nHorses originated in North America more than 4 million years ago before evolving and dispersing into Eurasia. Study results show that horses were quickly integrated into Indigenous lifeways upon their reintroduction.\n\nA team composed of Indigenous and Western scientists investigated this history through an interdisciplinary study of historic archaeological horse remains that integrated genomic, isotopic, radiocarbon, and paleopathological evidence. They found that horses quickly spread from Spanish settlements in the Southwest into the Northern Rockies and Great Plains by at least the early 1600s via Indigenous trading networks, and they were well-integrated into Indigenous societies and their beliefs, trade and transport networks before the arrival of Europeans in the region in the 18 century. The researchers found that horses were integrated into Indigenous life many decades earlier than was previously understood by the Western scientific community - findings that align with the oral histories of multiple Indigenous groups.\n\nSaid Antonia Loretta Afraid of Bear-Cook, co-author and knowledge keeper for the Oglala Lakota, \"Together with our horses, we have always understood what it means to be free. What is done to us, is done to them. Their story is our story. In granting this award, you heard us with your hearts. Your award honors our traditional sciences, knowledge and this deep ancestral relationship.\"\n\nJudges praised the paper not only for its significant breadth of scientific methods and authorship but also for the leadership of Indigenous scientists and knowledge keepers.\n\n\"Walking the earth as Lakota is to protect, sustain and advocate for all life. This global collaboration and those to come are what is necessary for ourselves and all Peoples to protect their traditional lands, relations and life ways for the sustainability of Grandmother Earth and all life. The time is upon us,\" said Chief Joe American Horse, co-author, Oceti Sakowin knowledge keeper and Indigenous scientist.\n\nThe findings can serve as a model for further research informed by both Indigenous and Western scientific systems.\n\n\"This award creates a global platform of recognition demonstrating the strength inherent in combining Indigenous and Western scientific systems, methods and methodologies to create a powerful new path forward in the sciences,\" said Yvette Running Horse Collin, an Oglala Lakota scientist and geneticist.\n\nSaid Ludovic Orlando, senior author and study coordinator, Director of the Centre for Anthropobiology and Genomics of Toulouse, France, \"Following the horse brought together research systems built on totally different foundations. This award first and foremost goes to horses for their capacity to help us navigate between different worlds and reconnect them.\"\n\nComanche Tribal Elder and Historian Jimmy Arterberry said, \"This award represents the honor of our oral traditions, affirmed through science.\"\n\nAdded corresponding author William Taylor, assistant professor and curator of archaeology at the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History and director of the CU Archaeozoology Laboratory, \"Winning this prize is a tremendous honor for each of us, and it feels like recognition of an important shift in the way we approach both science and the study of our past. I know that for the folks on this diverse team and for our university, though, it's just a starting point - and I can't wait to see where we can build outwards to from here.\"",

        "title": "16 insights from St. John Paul II on divine mercy",
        "text": "Home\"National & World News\"16 insights from St. John Paul II on divine mercy National & World News 16 insights from St. John Paul II on divine mercy Catholic News Agency 2024-04-01 Catholic News Agency / April 1, 2024 / 0 0 Shares Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp\n\nBy Joseph Pronechen\n\nNational Catholic Register, Apr 7, 2024 / 04:00 am\n\nSt. John Paul II has been called the \"mercy pope\" for good reason.\n\nAs pope, he beatified and then canonized St. Faustina Kowalska, who received the message of divine mercy that later spread throughout the world. Long before that, when it seemed the writings about divine mercy would never see the public light, it was John Paul II who stepped in to move the process along. He spoke and wrote about divine mercy and made the Second Sunday of Easter Divine Mercy Sunday for the entire Church. And he died on the Vigil of Divine Mercy Sunday.\n\nThe Polish pope had much to say about divine mercy throughout his pontificate and even wrote an encyclical, Dives in Misericordia, about God's mercy. Divine Mercy Sunday -- which is always the first Sunday after Easter Sunday -- is a perfect time to remember some of his many words about this great gift of God.\n\n1. Three years after being elected pope, John Paul II said on the feast of Christ the King:\n\n\"Right from the beginning of my ministry in St. Peter's See in Rome, I considered this message my special task. Providence has assigned it to me in the present situation of man, the Church, and the world. It could be said that precisely this situation assigned that message to me as my task before God.\"\n\n2. When he was in Poland on Aug. 17, 2002, for the dedication of the Divine Mercy Shrine in Krakow-Lagiewniki, John Paul II said in his homily:\n\n\"Like St. Faustina, we wish to proclaim that apart from the mercy of God there is no other source of hope for mankind. We desire to repeat with faith: Jesus, I trust in you!\"\n\n3. At the dedication, he continued:\n\n\"This proclamation, this confession of trust in the all-powerful love of God is especially needed in our own time, when mankind is experiencing bewilderment in the face of many manifestations of evil. The invocation of God's mercy needs to rise up from the depth of hearts filled with suffering, apprehension, and uncertainty, and at the same time yearning for an infallible source of hope.\n\n\"That is why we have come here today ... in order to glimpse once more in Christ the face of the Father: 'the Father of mercies and the God of all consolation' (2 Cor 1:3).\"\n\n4. Emphasizing that divine mercy is not just for one place, he said:\n\n\"May the binding promise of the Lord Jesus be fulfilled: from here there must go forth 'the spark which will prepare the world for his final coming' ('Diary,' 1732). This spark needs to be lighted by the grace of God. This fire of mercy needs to be passed on to the world. In the mercy of God the world will find peace and mankind will find happiness!\"\n\n5. On April 18, 1993, on Divine Mercy Sunday, tens of thousands attending the beatification of St. Faustina listened as John Paul II told them during Mass:\n\n\"It is truly marvelous how her devotion to the merciful Jesus is spreading in our contemporary world and gaining so many human hearts! This is doubtlessly a sign of the times -- a sign of our 20th century. The balance of this century, which is now ending, in addition to the advances which have often surpassed those of preceding eras, presents a deep restlessness and fear of the future. Where, if not in the divine mercy, can the world find refuge and the light of hope? Believers understand that perfectly.\"\n\n6. Seven years later on another Divine Mercy Sunday, April 30, 2000, the first of the new millennium, John Paul II canonized Sister Faustina, \"the great apostle of Divine Mercy.\" The pope said:\n\n\"Divine mercy reaches human beings through the heart of Christ crucified: 'My daughter, say that I am love and mercy personified,' Jesus will ask Sister Faustina ('Diary,' 1074). Christ pours out this mercy on humanity though the sending of the Spirit who ... is love. And is not mercy love's 'second name' (Dives in Misericordia, 7), understood in its deepest and most tender aspect, in its ability to take upon itself the burden of any need and, especially, in its immense capacity for forgiveness?\"\n\n7. That day John Paul II also added:\n\n\"What will man's future on earth be like? We are not given to know ... But the light of divine mercy, which the Lord in a way wished to return to the world through Sister Faustina's charism, will illuminate the way for the men and women of the third millennium.\"\n\n8. That same day, John Paul II gave many memorable insights into and words about divine mercy:\n\n\"This consoling message is addressed above all to those who, afflicted by a particularly harsh trial or crushed by the weight of the sins they committed, have lost all confidence in life and are tempted to give in to despair. To them the gentle face of Christ is offered; those rays from his heart touch them and shine upon them, warm them, show them the way and fill them with hope. How many souls have been consoled by the prayer 'Jesus, I trust in you,' which Providence intimated through Sister Faustina! This simple act of abandonment to Jesus dispels the thickest clouds and lets a ray of light penetrate every life. 'Jezu, ufam tobie.'\"\n\n9. In his Divine Mercy Sunday homily in 2001, it was obvious the Holy Father was describing the meaning of the image of the divine mercy when he said:\n\n\"The heart of Christ! His 'Sacred Heart' has given men everything: redemption, salvation, sanctification. St. Faustina Kowalska saw coming from this heart that was overflowing with generous love two rays of light, which illuminated the world. 'The two rays,' according to what Jesus himself told her, 'represent the blood and the water' ('Diary,' p. 132). The blood recalls the sacrifice of Golgotha and the mystery of the Eucharist; the water, according to the rich symbolism of the evangelist John, makes us think of baptism and the gift of the Holy Spirit (Jn 3:5; 4:14).\n\n\"Through the mystery of this wounded heart, the restorative tide of God's merciful love continues to spread over the men and women of our time. Here alone can those who long for true and lasting happiness find its secret.\"\n\n10. At the same time, John Paul II reminded us of something Christ in his divine mercy messages said we must do:\n\n\"Christ has taught us that 'man not only receives and experiences the mercy of God, but is also called' to practice mercy toward others: 'Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy' (Mt 5:7). He also showed us the many paths of mercy, which not only forgives sins but reaches out to all human needs. Jesus bent over every kind of human poverty, material and spiritual.\"\n\n11. In Dives in Misericordia, written in 1980, three years after being elected pope, John Paul II focused on God's mercy especially shown through Jesus Christ, writing:\n\n\"Christ confers on the whole of the Old Testament tradition about God's mercy a definitive meaning. Not only does he speak of it and explain it by the use of comparisons and parables, but above all he himself makes it incarnate and personifies it. He himself, in a certain sense, is mercy. To the person who sees it in him -- and finds it in him -- God becomes 'visible' in a particular way as the Father who is rich in mercy.\"\n\n12. The pope also wrote:\n\n\"The truth, revealed in Christ, about God the 'Father of mercies,' enables us to 'see' him as particularly close to man especially when man is suffering, when he is under threat at the very heart of his existence and dignity. And this is why, in the situation of the Church and the world today, many individuals and groups guided by a lively sense of faith are turning, I would say almost spontaneously, to the mercy of God. They are certainly being moved to do this by Christ himself, who through his Spirit works within human hearts.\"\n\n13. A very Marian pope, John Paul II wrote this about our Blessed Mother's role in divine mercy:\n\n\"Mary, then, is the one who has the deepest knowledge of the mystery of God's mercy. She knows its price. She knows how great it is. In this sense, we call her the mother of mercy: Our Lady of Mercy or Mother of Divine Mercy. In each one of these titles there is a deep theological meaning, for they express the special preparation of her soul, of her whole personality, so that she was able to perceive, through the complex events, first of Israel, then of every individual and of the whole of humanity, that mercy of which 'from generation to generation' people become sharers according to the eternal design of the Most Holy Trinity.\"\n\n14. He also said:\n\n\"We must note that Christ, in revealing the love and mercy of God, at the same time demanded from people that they also should be guided in their lives by love and mercy. This requirement forms part of the very essence of the messianic message and constitutes the heart of the Gospel ethos ... in the Sermon on the Mount he proclaims: 'Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.'\"\n\n15. Then the pope sounded a note of warning even more suitable now:\n\n\"The more the human conscience succumbs to secularization, loses its sense of the very meaning of the word 'mercy,' moves away from God and distances itself from the mystery of mercy, the more the Church has the right and the duty to appeal to the God of mercy 'with loud cries.' These 'loud cries' should be the mark of the Church of our times, cries uttered to God to implore his mercy, the certain manifestation of which she professes and proclaims as having already come in Jesus crucified and risen, that is, in the paschal mystery. It is this mystery which bears within itself the most complete revelation of mercy ...\"\n\n16. During his first general audience the day after he beatified St. Faustina, John Paul II strongly reminded everyone of what he saw as a \"clear indicator of the way\" for us to follow:\n\n\"'Jesus, I trust in you.' There is no such darkness in which man would need to lose himself. If only he will put his trust in Jesus, he will always find himself in the light. Praised be Jesus Christ!\"\n\nThis article was originally published on April 16, 2023, by the National Catholic Register, CNA's sister news partner, and has been updated and adapted by CNA.\n\nTags:Divine Mercy SundayJoseph PronechenPope St. John Paul II Previous post\n\nCatholic cemeteries on the front line against secular fear of death\n\nNext post\n\nJ.K.

        "text": "Muscat: In the dynamic landscape of the Middle East, Oman stands as a beacon of peace and stability. Its principled approach to diplomacy and unwavering commitment to harmony have earned it acclaim on the global stage.\n\nRecognising these contributions, The Diplomatic World magazine has bestowed upon the Sultanate of Oman the honour of being a pivotal force for peace in the region and called it an architect of peace in the tumultuous landscape of the Middle East.\n\nIn a comprehensive coverage, The Diplomatic World underscored the foundational elements of Oman's foreign policy, extolling its blueprint of peaceful coexistence and harmony. The spotlight also illuminated Oman's visionary national tourism strategy, highlighting its distinctive facets and the developmental strides in Omani media.\n\nFurthermore, the article delved into the Sultanate's unwavering commitment to preserving cultural heritage, its robust economy, and its burgeoning investment prospects, reflecting a landscape ripe with promise and opportunity.\n\nBarbara Dietrich, the CEO of The Diplomatic World, conveyed her profound admiration for Oman's ethos of peaceful coexistence and harmony during her visit to the nation.\n\nShe lauded Oman as a beacon of inspiration, emphasising its pivotal role as a discreet architect of peace in the Middle East.\n\nShe commended Oman's adeptness in mediation diplomacy, citing its steadfast pursuit of balancing interests, tolerance for differences, and the relentless quest for mutual benefits as foundational pillars of its foreign policy.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with The Diplomatic World, Sayyid Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, expounded on Oman's principled approach to international relations.\n\nHe elucidated that Oman's diplomatic ethos revolves around a singular objective: to earnestly comprehend and acknowledge the interests of others while articulating its own perspectives candidly and authentically.\n\nAl Busaidi underscored Oman's unwavering commitment to principles of mutual trust, transparency, and credibility, eschewing hidden agendas or deceptive practices.\n\nHis Excellency said: \"Oman's foreign policy highly values the principles of mutual trust, transparency and maintaining credibility at all times, and does not adopt a hidden agenda or deceptive practices. We are very honest in what we believe in, and we speak with our friends frankly, even if we disagree with each other. We cannot be hypocrites.\"\n\nFurthermore, the Minister of Foreign Affairs elaborated Oman's stance of constructive neutrality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other nations, firmly asserting Oman's sovereignty while advocating for pragmatic realism, openness, and good neighbourliness. Noteworthy is Oman's steadfast encouragement of inclusive dialogue, ensuring the equitable participation of all stakeholders without bias or favoritism.\n\nHighlighting Oman's diplomatic endeavours, Al Busaidi underscored Oman's pivotal role in fostering reconciliation between regional powers, including efforts to facilitate the release of detainees in conflict zones.\n\nHis Excellency said that the Sultanate of Oman encouraged rapprochement between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran, and highlighted Oman's efforts to release detainees in Yemen or Iran, as well as diplomatic efforts aimed at ameliorating the Syrian crisis in the Arab world.\n\nNotably, Oman has been instrumental in diplomatic initiatives aimed at and addressing the humanitarian plight in Gaza.\n\nAl Busaidi emphasised the global consensus favouring justice for the Palestinian people in the wake of Israeli aggression, denouncing tactics that stifle dissent and perpetuate conflict. He advocated for a paradigm shift towards inclusivity and understanding as the antidote to extremism, emphasising the imperative of bridging divides through dialogue and shared perspectives.\n\nAl Busaidi said: \"We are witnessing countries that see the behaviour of Israel and its supporters as not only hypocritical, or disproportionate, but also genocidal. I believe that strategies that involve escalating conflicts, or silencing those who disagree with us, do not lead to peace.\"\n\nThe Minister of Foreign Affairs pointed out that the only way through which extremism can be combated is to stop the endless cycle of violence, and try to understand points of view and share our own ideas on the basis of inclusiveness and equality, even if the divisions sometimes seem too wide, or difficult to overcome, and in this way we can chart a meaningful path to peace.\n\nIn conclusion, Al Busaidi reiterated Oman's unwavering commitment to fostering peace and understanding in the region, championing a path guided by inclusivity, equality, and dialogue as the cornerstone of sustainable peacebuilding efforts.",

        "text": "Muscat: The Diplomatic World Magazine has described the Sultanate of Oman as an architect of peace in the Middle East.\n\nThe magazine highlighted the foundations of the Sultanate of Oman's foreign policy, its model of peaceful coexistence and harmony, the national tourism strategy, the unique components of tourism, the aspects of development of the Omani media, the preservation of cultural values, the strength of the Omani economy, and competitiveness with the diversity of promising investment opportunities.\n\nBarbara Dietrich, CEO of the Diplomatic World, conducted interviews with several of their Excellencies, including the Ministers and Excellencies. She said in her opening speech that many countries work tirelessly for peace. After she visited the Sultanate of Oman, she expressed her admiration for the model of peaceful coexistence and harmony that \"inspired\" her, as she described it.\n\nThe CEO described the Sultanate of Oman as \"a discreet architect of peace in the Middle East\" and noted that it is famous for its mediation diplomacy. He added that balancing interests, tolerance towards differences, and a determined search for mutual benefits constitute some of the basic building blocks of the Sultanate of Oman's practical foreign policy.\n\nHis Excellency Sayyid Badr bin Hamad Al Busaidi, Minister of Foreign Affairs, said in an interview with the magazine: \"The principle of the Sultanate of Oman's management of its international relations is focused on a very specific goal, which is to listen to and understand the interests of others, express our views and opinions, and speak the truth as we see it.\"\n\nHis Excellency added, \"Omani foreign policy highly values the principles of mutual trust, transparency, and maintaining credibility at all times. It does not adopt a hidden agenda or practice tricks. We are very honest in what we believe in, and we speak with our friends frankly, even if we disagree with each other. We cannot be hypocrites.\"\n\nHis Excellency clarified that the foreign policy of the Sultanate of Oman is based on constructive neutrality and non-interference in the affairs of others, and it does not accept the interference of others in its internal affairs. Pointing out that \"pragmatic\" realism, openness and good neighbourliness constitute important principles within the framework of Omani foreign policy, which always encourages the importance of dialogue to include all opposing parties without marginalising any party or preferring any party over another.\n\nHis Excellency noted that the Sultanate of Oman encouraged rapprochement between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran. He noted Omani efforts to release detainees in Yemen or Iran and diplomatic efforts aimed at reversing Syria's situation in the Arab world. Regarding Gaza, His Excellency pointed to the growing global division over the Israeli attack on Gaza, stressing that the global consensus we are currently witnessing is in favour of achieving justice for the Palestinian people.\n\nIn this regard, His Excellency said: \"We are witnessing countries that see the behaviour of Israel and its supporters as not only hypocritical, or disproportionate, but also genocidal. I believe strategies that involve escalating conflicts or silencing those who disagree with us do not lead to peace.\"\n\nHis Excellency pointed out that the only way to combat extremism is to stop the endless cycle of violence, try to understand points of view and share our own ideas on the basis of inclusiveness and equality, even if the divisions sometimes seem too wide or difficult to overcome. In this way, we can chart a meaningful path to peace.",

        "text": "Loading...Loading...\n\nStrategic collaboration will strengthen Spain's open and ethical AI initiatives to stimulate economic and technical efforts\n\nMADRID, April 5, 2024 /CNW/ -- The President of the Government, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, and the Senior Vice President of IBM IBM and Director of IBM Research, Dar\u00edo Gil, met this afternoon at the Moncloa Complex, where they celebrated the new agreement reached between the Executive and IBM that will allow the development of foundational models for Artificial Intelligence, native in Spanish and co-official languages. During the meeting, which was also attended by the Minister for Digital Transformation and the Civil Service, Jos\u00e9 Luis Escriv\u00e1; the director of the Office of Economic Affairs of the Presidency of the Government, Manuel de la Rocha, and the president of IBM Spain, Portugal, Greece and Israel, Horacio Morell, they shared challenges and initiatives that are opening up in the field of artificial intelligence and supercomputing.\n\nAfterwards, the Government of Spain, through its Ministry for Digital Transformation, the Civil Service, and IBM today signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to promote their collaboration in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI supercomputing, advance the development and practical deployment of open, ethical and responsible generative AI in Spain, and sharing the vision to create a leading suite of foundation models including both large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs), proficient in the Spanish language and co-official languages.\n\nDuring the meeting at La Moncloa, the President stressed that agreements such as this one demonstrate Spain's commitment to accelerate the ethical and responsible use of AI, particularly in the public sector, with great impact on productivity for many sectors of the economy and on Europe's strategic autonomy.\n\nThe document was signed today in Madrid by Dar\u00edo Gil, Senior Vice President and Director of IBM Research, and Jos\u00e9 Luis Escriv\u00e1, Minister for Digital Transformation and Civil Service of the Government of Spain. Tapping into IBM's open-source AI framework, communities will be able to shape and contribute to the Spanish LLM, that will also include co-official languages (Catalan, Basque, Galician and Valencian) increasing innovation, transparency and safety while ensuring a more cost-efficient yet technologically competitive position in the market. The collaboration also reflects the intention to develop AI-enhanced techniques to accelerate the discovery, development, and validation of new materials to increase the sustainability of the semiconductors value chain.\n\n\"AI positions us at the threshold of a new industrial revolution, with a very significant potential impact in terms of productivity gains for a large number of economic sectors and in providing better public services to our citizens,\" said the minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Escriv\u00e1. \"The Government of Spain is promoting a useful and ethical development of the opportunities offered by this technology. IBM, with its experience, knowledge, and resources, is an excellent partner to accompany us in our vision.\"\n\n\"IBM shares this bold vision to accelerate the Government of Spain's AI strategy and to be the national AI partner for Spain,\" said Dar\u00edo Gil, IBM SVP and Director of IBM Research. \"We will leverage IBM's deep investments across the entire AI stack, from compute to models, we will enable an open community to drive the full potential of AI technologies. Together, we will work to foster the responsible use of AI to drive sustainable growth in Spain, and all Spanish speaking countries worldwide.\"\n\nSpanish is the second leading spoken language in the world (6.2% of the world's population1). One of the priority areas under this MoU is to collaborate in a leading suite of foundation models, including both large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs), proficient in the Spanish language and co-official languages. Creating models that are entirely designed in Spanish will enhance AI sustainability by reducing biases and providing competitive alternatives for the Spanish industry. These models will be refined using advanced tuning and alignment techniques, encompassing innovative methods that facilitate direct community enhancements and foster an ecosystem of AI creators and builders, utilizing assets developed through this collaboration.\n\nRecent advances in generative AI and AI supercomputing hold tremendous promise for governments and economies who can realize the productivity gains enabled by these technologies. With this collaboration, the Government of Spain is taking decisive action to seize this opportunity with timely and transformative commitments to invest in the AI revolution.\n\nThe coordination within the government institutions in this field will facilitate both widespread use of AI across national, regional, and local economies, as well as the timely and sufficient resources needed to build competitive advantages within a rapidly evolving AI-driven commercial landscape. This includes investment in human capital (upskilling and tooling) and community-driven adoption of AI to ensure that the productivity benefits and economic gains can positively impact across the economy of Spain, from small-medium sized businesses (SMBs) to large enterprises and the public sector.\n\nTaking this into account, the Memorandum of Understanding is based on five principles;\n\nPromote the development of a suite of foundation models, including both large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs), proficient in the Spanish language and co-official languages.Collaborate on the research and development of a full stack generative AI platform, including software built on open-source frameworks and tools as well as infrastructure enabling hardware diversity.Promote national and regional AI strategies through a cooperative approach that promotes a responsible use of the foundation models and the associated generative AI platform. This collaborative effort aims to benefit the public sector and SMEs throughout Spain.Foster an ecosystem of AI creators and builders, utilizing assets developed through this collaboration, to establish Spain as a global leader in AI. Develop AI-enhanced techniques to accelerate the discovery, development, and validation of new materials to advance the sustainability of the semiconductor industry value chain.\n\nAn additional priority described under this memorandum is to collaborate on the research and development of AI technology for supercomputing applications.\n\nAbout IBM\n\nIBM is a leading provider of global hybrid cloud and AI, and consulting expertise.

In early lines of treatment, regimens consisting of combinations of IMiDs, PIs, and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies are often used to help manage the disease. Unfortunately, as many patients go on to relapse and/or become refractory to these classes of therapy, more patients are becoming triple-class exposed earlier in their treatment journey. There are limited options for these patients, and triple-class exposed relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma is associated with poor outcomes and a median progression-free survival (PFS) of three to five months. In this patient population with high unmet need, Abecma has demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in PFS (95% CI: 13.3 months vs. 4.4 months [HR: 0.49; pAbecma exhibited a well-established safety profile with mostly low-grade cytokine release syndrome and neurotoxicity. No cases of Parkinsonism were reported in the study.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe results of the KarMMa-3 study are remarkable, especially given the historic outcomes with standard regimens for these patients with relapsed or refractory disease,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Al-Ola A. Abdallah, M.D., University of Kansas, Clinical Associate Professor, Clinical Director, Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapeutics and chair of U.S. Myeloma Innovations Research Collaborative. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWith this approval, these patients now have an opportunity to be treated at an earlier line of therapy with a potentially transformative therapy that offers significantly improved progression-free survival for this difficult-to-treat disease that has had no established treatment approach.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nTo support this approval and future expansions, Bristol Myers Squibb has made continuous investments to increase manufacturing capacity and has shown a consistently high manufacturing success rate of 94% for Abecma in the commercial setting.\n\nAbecma was recently approved in Japan, Switzerland and the European Union for adult patients with triple-class exposed relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma after two prior lines of therapy, making it the only CAR T cell therapy available globally for earlier lines of therapy for patients with triple-class exposed relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. Abecma is also currently approved in Great Britain and Israel for adult patients with triple-class exposed relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma after three or more prior lines of therapy.\n\nKarMMa-3 Pivotal Trial Results\n\nThe KarMMa-3 trial is a pivotal, Phase 3, open-label, global, randomized, controlled trial evaluating Abecma compared to standard regimens in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received two to four prior lines of treatment, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody, and were refractory to the last treatment regimen, with 94% of patients with disease refractory to prior treatment with daratumumab. KarMMa-3 is the only Phase 3 trial to evaluate a CAR T cell therapy in a patient population consisting entirely of triple-class exposed relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients. The trial\u00e2\u0080\u0099s patient-centric design allowed for crossover from standard regimens to Abecma upon confirmed disease progression. At the time of the final progression-free survival (PFS) analysis, more than half (56%) of patients in the standard regimens arm crossed over to receive Abecma as a subsequent therapy.\n\nIn the study, 254 patients were randomized to receive Abecma and 132 were randomized to receive standard regimens that consisted of combinations that included daratumumab, pomalidomide, and dexamethasone (DPd), daratumumab, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (DVd), ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (IRd), carfilzomib and dexamethasone (Kd) or elotuzumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (EPd) chosen based on their most recent treatment regimen and investigator discretion. In the Abecma arm, pretreatment consisted of leukapheresis and optional bridging therapy. The choice to use bridging therapy was at the discretion of the investigator.\n\nAt an estimated median duration of follow-up of 15.9 months at the primary PFS analysis, Abecma more than tripled the primary endpoint of PFS compared with standard regimens, with a median PFS of 13.3 months (95% CI: 11.8-16.1) vs. 4.4 months (95% CI: 3.4-5.9), respectively (HR:0.49; 95% CI: 0.38-0.64; pAbecma. Abecma also showed a significant improvement in overall response rates (pAbecma achieving a response, and 39% achieving a complete or stringent complete response. In comparison, less than half of patients (42%) who received standard regimens achieved a response, with 5% experiencing a complete response or stringent complete response. Responses were durable with Abecma, with a median duration of response of 14.8 months (95% CI: 12.0-18.6). In those patients who derived a complete response or better, median duration of response was 20 months (95% CI: 15.8-24.3).\n\nAbecma has exhibited a well-established and consistent safety profile with mostly low-grade cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity. Among patients who received Abecma in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies (n=349), any grade CRS occurred in 89% of patients, including Grade >3 CRS in 7% of patients, and three cases (0.9%) of Grade 5 CRS reported. The median time to onset of CRS was 1 day (range: 1-27 days), and the median duration of CRS was 5 days (range: 1-63 days). Any grade neurotoxicity occurred in 40% of patients treated with Abecma in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, including Grade 3 neurotoxicity in 4% of patients, and two cases (0.6%) of Grade 4 neurotoxicity reported. At the safety update for KarMMa-3, one case of Grade 5 neurotoxicity was reported. The median time to onset of neurotoxicity was 2 days (range: 1-148 days), and the median duration of neurotoxicity was 8 days (range: 1-720 days).\n\nAbout Abecma\n\nAbecma is a CAR T cell therapy that recognizes and binds to BCMA on the surface of multiple myeloma cells leading to CAR T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and subsequent cytolytic killing of BCMA-expressing cells. Abecma is being jointly developed and commercialized in the U.S. as part of a Co-Development, Co-Promotion, and Profit Share Agreement between Bristol Myers Squibb and 2seventy bio.\n\nThis approval further underscores Bristol Myers Squibb\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deep knowledge and experience in cell therapy science and continued clinical advancements for multiple myeloma patients. The companies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 broad clinical development program for Abecma includes ongoing and planned clinical studies (KarMMa-2, KarMMa-3, KarMMa-9) for patients with multiple myeloma.

Early deaths occurred in 8% (20/254) and 0% prior to ABECMA infusion and standard regimen administration, respectively, and 10% (25/254) and 11% (15/132) after ABECMA infusion and standard regimen administration, respectively. Out of the 20 deaths that occurred prior to ABECMA infusion, 15 occurred from disease progression, 3 occurred from adverse events and 2 occurred from unknown causes. Out of the 25 deaths that occurred after ABECMA infusion, 10 occurred from disease progression, 11 occurred from adverse events, and 4 occurred from unknown causes.\n\nCytokine Release Syndrome (CRS): CRS, including fatal or life-threatening reactions, occurred following treatment with ABECMA. Among patients receiving ABECMA for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies (N=349), CRS occurred in 89% (310/349), including \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 Grade 3 CRS (Lee grading system) in 7% (23/349) of patients and Grade 5 CRS in 0.9% (3/349) of patients. The median time-to-onset of CRS, any grade, was 1 day (range: 1 to 27 days), and the median duration of CRS was 5 days (range: 1 to 63 days). In the pooled studies, the rate of \u00e2\u0089\u00a5Grade 3 CRS was 10% (7/71) for patients treated in dose range of 460 to 510 x 106 CAR-positive T cells and 5.4% (13/241) for patients treated in dose range of 300 to 460 x 106 CAR-positive T cells.\n\nThe most common manifestations of CRS (greater than or equal to 10%) included pyrexia (87%), hypotension (30%), tachycardia (26%), chills (19%), hypoxia (16%). Grade 3 or higher events that may be associated with CRS include hypotension, hypoxia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypofibrinogenemia, ARDS, atrial fibrillation, hepatocellular injury, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary edema, coagulopathy, renal failure, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and HLH/MAS.\n\nIdentify CRS based on clinical presentation. Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. CRS has been reported to be associated with findings of HLH/MAS, and the physiology of the syndromes may overlap. HLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition. In patients with progressive symptoms of CRS or refractory CRS despite treatment, evaluate for evidence of HLH/MAS.\n\nOf the 349 patients who received ABECMA in clinical trials, 226 (65%) patients received tocilizumab; 39% (135/349) received a single dose, while 26% (91/349) received more than 1 dose of tocilizumab. Overall, 24% (82/349) of patients received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. Almost all patients who received corticosteroids for CRS also received tocilizumab. For patients treated in dose range of 460 to 510 x 106 CAR-positive T cells, 76% (54/71) of patients received tocilizumab and 35% (25/71) received at least 1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. For patients treated in dose range of 300 to 460 x 106 CAR-positive T cells, 63% (152/241) of patients received tocilizumab and 20% (49/241) received at least 1 dose of corticosteroid for treatment of CRS.\n\nMonitor patients at least daily for 7 days following ABECMA infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs or symptoms of CRS and monitor patients for signs or symptoms of CRS for at least 4 weeks after ABECMA infusion. At the first sign of CRS, institute treatment with supportive care, tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids as indicated. Ensure that a minimum of 2 doses of tocilizumab are available prior to infusion of ABECMA. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur at any time.\n\nNeurologic Toxicities: Neurologic toxicities, including immune-effector cell-associated neurotoxicity (ICANS), which may be severe or life- threatening, occurred concurrently with CRS, after CRS resolution, or in the absence of CRS following treatment with ABECMA.\n\nIn patients receiving ABECMA in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity occurred in 40% (139/349), including Grade 3 in 4% (14/349) and Grade 4 in 0.6% (2/349) of patients. The median time to onset of neurotoxicity was 2 days (range: 1 to 148 days). The median duration of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity was 8 days (range: 1 to 720 days) in all patients including those with ongoing neurologic events at the time of death or data cut off. CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity resolved in 123 of 139 (88%) patients and median time to resolution was 5 days (range: 1 to 245 days). One-hundred and thirty four out of 349 (38%) patients with neurotoxicity had CRS. The onset of neurotoxicity during CRS was observed in 93 patients, before the onset of CRS in 12 patients, and after the CRS event in 29 patients. The rate of Grade 3 or 4 CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity was 5.6% (4/71) and 3.7% (9/241) for patients treated in dose range of 460 to 510 x 106 CAR-positive T cells and 300 to 460 x 106 CAR-positive T cells, respectively. The most frequent (greater than or equal to 5%) manifestations of CAR T cell-associated neurotoxicity include encephalopathy (21%), headache (15%), dizziness (8%), delirium (6%), and tremor (6%).\n\nAt the safety update for KarMMa-3 study, one patient developed fatal neurotoxicity 43 days after ABECMA. In KarMMa, one patient had ongoing Grade 2 neurotoxicity at the time of death. Two patients had ongoing Grade 1 tremor at the time of data cutoff.\n\nCerebral edema has been associated with ABECMA in a patient in another study in multiple myeloma. Grade 3 myelitis and Grade 3 parkinsonism have occurred after treatment with ABECMA in another study in multiple myeloma.\n\nMonitor patients at least daily for 7 days following ABECMA infusion at the REMS-certified healthcare facility for signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicities and monitor patients for signs or symptoms of neurologic toxicities for at least 4 weeks after ABECMA infusion and treat promptly. Rule out other causes of neurologic symptoms. Neurologic toxicity should be managed with supportive care and/or corticosteroids as needed. Counsel patients to seek immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at any time.\n\nHemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)/Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS): In patients receiving ABECMA in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, HLH/MAS occurred in 2.9% (10/349) of patients. All events of HLH/MAS had onset within 10 days of receiving ABECMA, with a median onset of 6.5 days (range: 4 to 10 days) and occurred in the setting of ongoing or worsening CRS. Five patients with HLH/MAS had overlapping neurotoxicity. The manifestations of HLH/MAS include hypotension, hypoxia, multiple organ dysfunction, renal dysfunction and cytopenia.\n\nIn KarMMa-3, one patient had Grade 5, two patients had Grade 4 and two patients had Grade 3 HLH/MAS. The patient with Grade 5 HLH/MAS also had Grade 5 candida sepsis and Grade 5 CRS. In another patient who died due to stroke, the Grade 4 HLH/MAS had resolved prior to death. Two cases of Grade 3 and one case of Grade 4 HLH/MAS had resolved.\n\nIn KarMMa, one patient treated in the 300 x 106 CAR-positive T cells dose cohort developed fatal multi-organ HLH/MAS with CRS. In another patient with fatal bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, HLH/MAS was contributory to the fatal outcome. Three cases of Grade 2 HLH/MAS resolved.\n\nHLH/MAS is a potentially life-threatening condition with a high mortality rate if not recognized early and treated. Treatment of HLH/MAS should be administered per institutional guidelines.\n\nABECMA REMS: Due to the risk of CRS and neurologic toxicities, ABECMA is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the ABECMA REMS. Further information is available at www.AbecmaREMS.com or contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1-866-340-7332.\n\nHypersensitivity Reactions: Allergic reactions may occur with the infusion of ABECMA. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, may be due to dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in ABECMA.\n\nInfections: ABECMA should not be administered to patients with active infections or inflammatory disorders. Severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections occurred in patients after ABECMA infusion.\n\nIn all patients receiving ABECMA in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, infections (all grades) occurred in 61% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 21% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 12%, viral infections in 7%, bacterial infections in 4.3%, and fungal infections in 1.4% of patients. Overall, 15 patients had Grade 5 infections (4.3%); 8 patients (2.3%) with infections of pathogen unspecified, 3 patients (0.9%) with fungal infections, 3 patients (0.9%) with viral infections, and 1 patient (0.3%) with bacterial infection.\n\nMonitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection before and after ABECMA infusion and treat appropriately. Administer prophylactic, pre-emptive, and/or therapeutic antimicrobials according to standard institutional guidelines.\n\nFebrile neutropenia was observed in 38% (133/349) of patients after ABECMA infusion and may be concurrent with CRS. In the event of febrile neutropenia, evaluate for infection and manage with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluids, and other supportive care as medically indicated.\n\nViral Reactivation: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection resulting in pneumonia and death has occurred following ABECMA administration. Monitor and treat for CMV reactivation in accordance with clinical guidelines. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation, in some cases resulting in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death, can occur in patients treated with drugs directed against plasma cells. Perform screening for CMV, HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in accordance with clinical guidelines before collection of cells for manufacturing. Consider antiviral therapy to prevent viral reactivation per local institutional guidelines/clinical practice.\n\nProlonged Cytopenias: In patients receiving ABECMA in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, 40% of patients (139/349) experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and 42% (145/349) experienced prolonged Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia that had not resolved by Month 1 following ABECMA infusion. In 89% (123/139) of patients who recovered from Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia after Month 1, the median time to recovery from ABECMA infusion was 1.9 months. In 76% (110/145) of patients who recovered from Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, the median time to recovery was 1.9 months. Five patients underwent stem cell therapy for hematopoietic reconstitution due to prolonged cytopenia. The rate of Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was 62% (44/71) and 56% (135/241) for patients treated in dose range of 460 to 510 x 106 CAR-positive T cells and 300 to 460 x 106 CAR-positive T cells, respectively.\n\nMonitor blood counts prior to and after ABECMA infusion. Manage cytopenia with myeloid growth factor and blood product transfusion support according to local institutional guidelines.\n\nHypogammaglobulinemia: In all patients receiving ABECMA in the KarMMa and KarMMa-3 studies, hypogammaglobulinemia was reported as an adverse event in 13% (46/349) of patients; laboratory IgG levels fell below 500 mg/dL after infusion in 37% (130/349) of patients treated with ABECMA.\n\nHypogammaglobulinemia either as an adverse reaction or laboratory IgG level below 500 mg/dL after infusion occurred in 45% (158/349) of patients treated with ABECMA. Forty-one percent of patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) post-ABECMA for serum IgG\n\nMonitor immunoglobulin levels after treatment with ABECMA and administer IVIG for IgG\n\nUse of Live Vaccines: The safety of immunization with live viral vaccines during or after ABECMA treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 weeks prior to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during ABECMA treatment, and until immune recovery following treatment with ABECMA.\n\nSecondary Malignancies: Patients treated with ABECMA may develop secondary malignancies. In KarMMa-3, myeloid neoplasms (four cases of myelodysplastic syndrome and one case of acute myeloid leukemia) occurred in 2.2% (5/222) of patients following treatment with ABECMA compared to none in the standard regimens arm at the time of the safety update. The median time to onset of myeloid neoplasm from ide-cel infusion was 338 days (Range: 277 to 794 days). Three of these five patients have died following the development of myeloid neoplasm. One out of the five cases of myeloid neoplasm occurred after initiation of subsequent antimyeloma therapy.\n\nT cell malignancies have occurred following treatment of hematologic malignancies with BCMA- and CD19-directed genetically modified autologous T cell immunotherapies, including ABECMA. Mature T cell malignancies, including CAR-positive tumors, may present as soon as weeks following infusion, and may include fatal outcomes.\n\nMonitor life-long for secondary malignancies. In the event that a secondary malignancy occurs, contact Bristol-Myers Squibb at 1\u00e2\u0080'888\u00e2\u0080'805\u00e2\u0080'4555 for reporting and to obtain instructions on collection of patient samples for testing of secondary malignancy.\n\nEffects on Ability to Drive and Operate Machinery: Due to the potential for neurologic events, including altered mental status or seizures, patients receiving ABECMA are at risk for altered or decreased consciousness or coordination in the 8 weeks following ABECMA infusion. Advise patients to refrain from driving and engaging in hazardous occupations or activities, such as operating heavy or potentially dangerous machinery, during this initial period.\n\nAdverse Reactions: The most common nonlaboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than or equal to 20%) include pyrexia, CRS, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections \u00e2\u0080\" pathogen unspecified, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, hypotension, tachycardia, diarrhea, nausea, headache, chills, upper respiratory tract infection, encephalopathy, edema, dyspnea and viral infections.\n\nPlease see full Prescribing Information, including Boxed WARNINGS and Medication Guide.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb: Creating a Better Future for People with Cancer\n\nBristol Myers Squibb is inspired by a single vision \u00e2\u0080\" transforming patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 lives through science.

One of the priority areas under this MoU is to collaborate in a leading suite of foundation models, including both large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs), proficient in the Spanish language and co-official languages. Creating models that are entirely designed in Spanish will enhance AI sustainability by reducing biases and providing competitive alternatives for the Spanish industry. These models will be refined using advanced tuning and alignment techniques, encompassing innovative methods that facilitate direct community enhancements and foster an ecosystem of AI creators and builders, utilizing assets developed through this collaboration.\n\nRecent advances in generative AI and AI supercomputing hold tremendous promise for governments and economies who can realize the productivity gains enabled by these technologies. With this collaboration, the Government of Spain is taking decisive action to seize this opportunity with timely and transformative commitments to invest in the AI revolution.\n\nThe coordination within the government institutions in this field will facilitate both widespread use of AI across national, regional, and local economies, as well as the timely and sufficient resources needed to build competitive advantages within a rapidly evolving AI-driven commercial landscape. This includes investment in human capital (upskilling and tooling) and community-driven adoption of AI to ensure that the productivity benefits and economic gains can positively impact across the economy of Spain, from small-medium sized businesses (SMBs) to large enterprises and the public sector.\n\nTaking this into account, the Memorandum of Understanding is based on five principles;\n\nPromote the development of a suite of foundation models, including both large language models (LLMs) and small language models (SLMs), proficient in the Spanish language and co-official languages.Collaborate on the research and development of a full stack generative AI platform, including software built on open-source frameworks and tools as well as infrastructure enabling hardware diversity.Promote national and regional AI strategies through a cooperative approach that promotes a responsible use of the foundation models and the associated generative AI platform.

        "text": "World Press Photo has announced the regional winners of its prestigious annual photo competition, highlighting the best photojournalism and documentary photography of 2024.\n\n\"Each year, jurors from all over the globe review tens of thousands of photos to find a selection that is visually stunning, tells stories that matter, and represents our shared world,\" explains Joumana El Zein Khoury, executive director of World Press Photo. \"This year's selection includes stories of desperation, hunger, war, and loss -- but also of perseverance, courage, love, family, dreams, and more butterflies than anyone has a right to expect.\"\n\nThere are 24 winning projects and six honorable mentions in total. This year's jury also decided to award a pair of special mentions in its overall selection, which is an exceptionally unusual decision.\n\nThe winning and honored images were chosen from a staggering 61,062 entries by 3,851 photographers from 130 different countries. They were first judged by a half dozen regional juries, and the winners were then picked by a global jury comprised of the regional jury chairs plus the global jury chair, Fiona Shields, Head of Photography at The Guardian.\n\n\"These final selected works are a tapestry of our world today, centered on images we believe were made with respect and integrity, that can speak universally and resonate far beyond their origins,\" remarks Shields.\n\n\"This is an opportunity to applaud the work of press and documentary photographers everywhere -- made with courage, intelligence, and ingenuity -- and to amplify the importance of the stories they are telling, often in unimaginable circumstances.\"\n\nThe regional winners are showcased below and organized by region. For photo series and long-term projects, selected images are included. The full gallery of photos is available on the World Press Photo website.\n\nFrom 2020 until a ceasefire in late 2022, violent conflict between government forces and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) held northern Ethiopia in a state of fear and destruction.\n\n\"Kibrom Berhane joined the Tigray Defense Forces (the armed wing of the TPLF) in early 2021, after government forces attacked his village in eastern Tigray. He fought until wounded by a grenade, losing his leg, a month before the peace agreement. Impressed by Kibrom's determination to return to his everyday life, the photographer wanted to show the aftermath of the war, revealing its hidden consequences,\" explains World Press Photo.\n\nIn Madagascar, a lack of public awareness concerning dementia results in people showing symptoms often being stigmatized.\n\nPaul Rakotozandriny, 91, has been cared for by his daughter, Fara Rafaraniriana, 41. The winning photo story shows the Malagasy principle of \"vailm-babena,\" the duty of children to help their parents.\n\nThe 2011 revolution in Tunisia, which led to the \"Arab Spring,\" inspired hope among Tunisians seeking democracy, social justice, and freedom. However, political instability has had many adverse effects since then, especially on younger people. This project looks at young Tunisians looking for a better future.\n\n\"In May 2021 a boat from Mauritania full of dead men was found off the coast of the Caribbean Island of Tobago. Who were these men and why were they on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean? Two visual journalists sought answers, uncovering a story about migrants from West Africa who seek opportunity in Europe via an increasingly popular but treacherous Atlantic route,\" writes World Press Photo.\n\nDuring the conflict in the Tigray region of Ethiopia, more than 100,000 women are believed to have been victimized by sexual violence. This project looks at the stigmatization these survivors face, including issues of isolation and rejection.\n\nIn this powerful image, Inas Abu Maamar, 36, holds the body of her niece, Saly, killed at age five along with four other family members by Israeli missile strikes in Gaza on October 17, 2023.\n\nWhen the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan in August 2021, the already devastated economy only got worse. A drought and major earthquakes worsened the dire situation. The United Nations believes that 97% of Afghans live below the poverty line. This powerful photo series looks at the realities of intersecting crisis in the war-torn country.\n\n\"This project is a private visual record that aims to explore the concept of family photos. In close collaboration with the family, the photographer tells the story of Jiuer, a young mother of three in northern China who gains more understanding and appreciation for life in her final years after being diagnosed with cancer. Before her surgery, Jiuer invited the photographer to take some family photos, and later, when her condition deteriorated, asked her to record the time she spent with her children,\" World Press Photo explains.\n\nDementia is a leading cause of disability among older adults. In Japan, in part due to the nation's long lifespan, about seven million people are expected to live with symptomatic dementia in 2025.\n\nThis project aims to visualize the large social issues concerning the condition, plus the inner lives of those who suffer from the debilitating disease.\n\n\"This project documents the Miya community that depends on land near the transnational Brahmaputra River for their livelihood and their identity in the eyes of the state. As their land erodes due to worsening floods, they face a fight against both nature and nation,\" writes World Press Photo.\n\nIn the early morning hours of February 6, 2023, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Turkey and Syria. The first of a series of earthquakes killed more than 55,000 people and displaced another 3.3 million.\n\n\"The horror of the father's situation as he refused to leave his daughter buried under the rubble especially moved the jury. They felt that the image both portrayed the tragedy and highlighted the combined consequences of natural disaster and corruption,\" explains World Press Photo.\n\nMesut Han\u00e7er is seen here holding the hand of his 15-year-old daughter, Irmak, who was killed in the earthquake while sleeping at her grandmother's home in southern Turkey.\n\nOn June 6, 2023, explosions damaged the wall of the Russian-controlled Kakhovka Dam in southeastern Ukraine, which caused extensive, damaging floods in Kherson. Approximately 17,500 homes were flooded, and hundreds of people were killed.\n\n\"Germany positions itself as a leader in the transition towards renewable energy by 2030, yet remains heavily dependent on coal for energy production. In the Rhineland, forests have been cleared and villages demolished since the 1970s to make way for the Hambach and Garzweiler open-pit coal mines. In 2012, activists began occupying parts of Hambach Forest and later the village of L\u00fctzerath to resist these measures, managing by 2023 to save a remainder of the forest and five of six such villages scheduled for destruction,\" says World Press Photo.\n\nAlthough peace is not on the horizon in Ukraine, and casualties continue to accumulate, international attention is primarily elsewhere. Photographer Julia Kochetova has created a personal website that combines documentary-style photography, photojournalism, and a diary to show the world what it is like to live in war every day.\n\n\"The Satyrus effendi is a rare butterfly species named after Rustam Effendi, a Soviet Azerbaijani entomologist and the photographer's father,\" says World Press Photo.\n\nPhotographer Rena Effendi has been retracing her father's footsteps, traversing a new war-torn region in search of the butterfly.\n\nDue to high temperatures and dry conditions, forest fires raged across Canada in the summer of 2023. Fires affected all 13 provinces, especially the northern parts of Quebec.\n\n\"The jury felt that the iconic composition of this single image -- reminiscent of a monument -- stands as a powerful symbol of our losing battle against climate change, and a metaphor for our collective arrogance in the face of the crisis,\" explains World Press Photo.\n\nThe eastern migratory monarch butterfly population has been in rapid decline since the mid-1990s, dropping by more than 80%. People in Canada, the United States, and Mexico are working together to reverse the worrying trend.\n\nIn recent years, Mexico has transformed from a nation that welcomes migrants and asylum seekers to being a country with strict immigration policies. For those trying to reach Mexico for a better life, the situation at the border is now one of significant danger.\n\n\"This project combines fiction with fact in order to confront the US space program's historical exclusion of openly LGBTQI+ astronauts. In a review of the NASA and United States National Archives, the photographer found no documentation on the contributions of the queer community to the space program. The absence inspired her to imagine The Gay Space Agency, a diverse and inclusionary institution that commemorates and celebrates the history of queer astronauts,\" World Press Photo explains of Mackenzie Calle's award-winning project.\n\nIsle de Jean-Charles, 130 kilometers (81 miles) south of New Orleans's coast, is sinking into the bayou. Since 1955, 98% of its surface area has disappeared.\n\nIn 2016, federal funds were sent to Louisiana to relocate the island's few remaining residents. Since then, 30 households have been relocated. They are the first community covered by a federal climate change resettlement program in the United States.\n\n\"In 2023, the Amazon experienced its most intense drought since recordkeeping began. The drought disproportionately impacted Indigenous, rural, and river communities. While Porto Praia has no road access and is normally reachable only by river, the drought meant that residents had to walk for kilometers along the dry riverbed to reach their homes, capturing the gravity of the global environmental crisis and drought in the Amazon in one moment,\" explains World Press Photo. The winning image below shows a fisherman walking across the dry riverbed of a branch of the Amazon on October 13, 2023, in Brazil.\n\nNearly 82% of Venezuelans live in poverty. This photo story shows how the country's reliance on oil has impacted the environment and its people.\n\n\"Mapuche communities are the Indigenous inhabitants of territories that are now part of Argentina and Chile... Discrimination and punishment of Mapuche activists persist, despite new laws apparently supporting Mapuche rights. For many Mapuche, this presents not solely a territorial dispute: the land is part of their cultural and spiritual identity,\" says World Press Photo.\n\nFrom 1980 to 2000, revolutionary insurgency groups in the Peruvian Amazon terrorized, tortured, and murdered LGBTQI+ people. This award-winning project collects the untold stories of some of these victims.\n\nOn October 30, 2022, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva ousted incumbent Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro. Extreme-right Bolsonaro supporters stormed the Brazilian Presidential Palace, National Congress, and Supreme Court buildings through coordinated action. Violent protestors and insurrectionists targeted many journalists documenting the insurrection.\n\nThe 500-person community on Kioa Island is comprised of people who left Tuvalu in the 1940s due to rising sea levels. Their \"new\" community is facing similar challenges, including eroding shorelines. Reduced landmass and eroding shorelines could displace more than 600 communities around Fiji in the coming years.\n\nChina continues to enforce its claims in the South China Sea, raising international fears about the region becoming embroiled in all-out war. More than a third of the global shipping industry goes through these waters.\n\nIn Myanmar, in February 2021, a military coup replaced the government. The military violently suppressed protests and opposition, leading to an armed resistance by the People's Defense Forces (PDF) and, ultimately, civil war. This winning long-term project follows the struggles of these rebel forces as they aim to take back their country.\n\n\"A striking meditation on the photographer's home country that connects its colonial past with its precarious climate future. This project presents a series of manipulated and recontextualized images, conveying the artist's personal feelings of frustration and horror in response to the devastating 2019-2020 wildfires in the state of New South Wales, Australia. These fires were some of the largest ever recorded in the country and fires will only get worse in size and intensity as the Earth continues to warm,\" World Press Photo explains.\n\nIndustrial waste has \"toxified\" the Cileungsi River in Indonesia. The thick foam seen in this image is the result of waste runoff.\n\nThis year, the jury chose to include two special mentions in the awards.\n\n\"These two special mentions reflect the gravity of the Israel-Hamas war in 2023, the extreme suffering of civilians, and its global political impact. While each photograph shows a single individual in the aftermath of a horrific attack, the contrast between the scenes helps viewers understand the differing scales of devastation without minimizing the individual suffering. We also wish to pay tribute to photographers reporting on this war, who are subjected to huge amounts of trauma, risk, and personal loss, particularly in Gaza,\" World Press Photo explains.\n\nNow that these regional winners have been selected, the jury now faces the monumental task of picking four global winners. These awards will be announced on April 18 at the Flagship World Press Photo Exhibition in Amsterdam.\n\nThe awarded stories, including the regional winners seen here, will be shown to millions of visitors as part of an international exhibition in over 60 locations.\n\nPeople can also view all the winning photographs online at the World Press Photo website.",

The execution and delivery of the applicable Transaction Documents and performance by such Purchaser of the transactions contemplated by such Transaction Documents have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate, partnership, limited liability company or similar action, as applicable, on the part of such Purchaser.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a Purchaser that is a multi-managed investment vehicle whereby separate portfolio managers manage separate portions of such Purchaser's assets and the portfolio managers have no direct knowledge of the investment decisions made by the portfolio managers managing other portions of such Purchaser's assets, the representation set forth above shall only apply with respect to the portion of assets managed by the portfolio manager that made the investment decision to purchase the Shares covered by this Agreement. Other than to other Persons party to this Agreement or to such Purchaser's representatives, including, without limitation, its officers, directors, partners, legal and other advisors, employees, agents and Affiliates, such Purchaser has maintained the confidentiality of all disclosures made to it in connection with this transaction (including the existence and terms of this transaction).\n\n(g) General Solicitation.

Each party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in the City of New York, Borough of Manhattan for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein (including with respect to the enforcement of any of the Transaction Documents), and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of any such court, that such action or proceeding is improper or is an inconvenient venue for such Proceeding.

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, all of which when taken together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each party and delivered to each other party, it being understood that the parties need not sign the same counterpart. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile transmission or by e-mail delivery of a \".pdf\" format data file, such signature shall create a valid and binding obligation of the party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) with the same force and effect as if such facsimile or \".pdf\" signature page were an original thereof.\n\n5.12 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties hereto shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to find and employ an alternative means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated by such term, provision, covenant or restriction.

In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, each of the Purchasers and the Company will be entitled to seek specific performance under the Transaction Documents. The parties agree that monetary damages may not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of any breach of obligations contained in the Transaction Documents and hereby agree to waive and not to assert in any action for specific performance of any such obligation the defense that a remedy at law would be adequate. Each party agrees that it shall not have a remedy of punitive or consequential damages against the other and hereby waives any right or claim to punitive or consequential damages it may now have or may arise in the future.\n\n5.16 Payment Set Aside. To the extent that the Company makes a payment or payments to any Purchaser pursuant to any Transaction Document or a Purchaser enforces or exercises its rights thereunder, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or exercise or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside, recovered from, disgorged by or are required to be refunded, repaid or otherwise restored to the Company, a trustee, receiver or any other Person under any law (including, without limitation, any bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause of action), then to the extent of any such restoration the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement or setoff had not occurred.\n\n5.17 Independent Nature of Purchasers' Obligations and Rights. The obligations of each Purchaser under any Transaction Document are several and not joint with the obligations of any other Purchaser, and no Purchaser shall be responsible in any way for the performance or non-performance of the obligations of any other Purchaser under any Transaction Document. Nothing contained herein or in any other Transaction Document, and no action taken by any Purchaser pursuant hereto or thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Purchasers as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Purchasers are in any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. Each Purchaser shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights including, without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction Documents, and it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. Each Purchaser has been represented by its own separate legal counsel in its review and negotiation of the Transaction Documents. The Company has elected to provide all Purchasers with the same terms and Transaction Documents for the convenience of the Company and not because it was required or requested to do so by any of the Purchasers. It is expressly understood and agreed that each provision contained in this Agreement and in each other Transaction Document is between the Company and a Purchaser, solely, and not between the Company and the Purchasers collectively and not between and among the Purchasers.\n\n5.18 Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc. If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding Business Day.\n\n5.19 Construction.

In addition, each and every reference to share prices and Common Shares in any Transaction Document shall be subject to adjustment for reverse and forward stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and other similar transactions of the Common Shares that occur after the date of this Agreement.\n\n5.20 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, OR PROCEEDING IN ANY JURISDICTION BROUGHT BY ANY PARTY AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY, THE PARTIES EACH KNOWINGLY AND INTENTIONALLY, TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, HEREBY ABSOLUTELY, UNCONDITIONALLY, IRREVOCABLY AND EXPRESSLY WAIVES FOREVER TRIAL BY JURY.\n\n(Signature Pages Follow)\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Securities Purchase Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized signatories as of the date first indicated above.\n\n[REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK SIGNATURE PAGE FOR PURCHASER FOLLOWS]\n\n[PURCHASER SIGNATURE PAGES TO SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT]\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have caused this Securities Purchase Agreement to be duly executed by their respective authorized signatories as of the date first indicated above.",

Given that well-being is not only the absence of mental illness but also the presence of positive psychological resources, the purpose of the present issue is to enrich scholarly understanding of the multitude of dimensions and perspectives related to human wellness, growth and potential.\n\nThe long-standing science of the psychology of religion and spirituality has unfolded over the last few decades, demonstrating evidence regarding the association between spirituality and greater well-being and better mental and physical health, and its role as a moderator for psychological adjustment to negative life experiences. At the same time, given the fast-paced growth in empirical evidence and interventions that the field of positive psychology has accomplished since its emergence in 1998, broadening and deepening the understanding of positive human functioning and growth entails an integrative and holistic view -- that takes into account various perspectives and aspects. Addressing the full range of human conditions, emotions and concerns can deepen our understanding of positive human functioning, flourishing, growth and mental health and portray \"life worth living\" as a whole. Topics of shared interest may include hope, forgiveness, gratitude, humility, resilience, compassion, awe, elevation, meaning and self-transcendence, offering a richer and more integrative view of human experience.\n\nThis issue will explore potential meeting points between spirituality, broadly defined, and positive psychology. The different orientations, backgrounds and propositions of the science of positive psychology and spirituality provide a fertile ground for a potential dialogue, based on each unique contribution to the understanding of the core essences of life worth living.\n\nManuscripts should be submitted online at www.mdpi.com by registering and logging in to this website.

Charity heads said that the campaign aimed to address the \"persistent underfunding\" of adult social care support, which the charity said, had been exacerbated by global events.\n\n\"This is a significant boost for everyone involved as we tackle the remaining challenges of securing the outstanding balance of our \u00a34 million funding gap, along with addressing the indirect consequences of ongoing world events on the charity,\" said chief executive Richard Franklin. \"However, if ever there was proof positive that united we stand and we are indeed better as one community, this outstandingly successful fundraiser is it.\"\n\nAish UK's Proudly JewAish campaign -From Crisis to Connection - raised \u00a32.4 million, enabling the charity to \"continue its vital work responding to crisis with connection and helping young Jews today feel proudly JewAish,\" said Rabbi Naftali Schiff, CEO of Aish UK and Jewish Futures. \"The stark reality is that if organisations like Aish UK are not fully supported and empowered today, thousands of young Jews across the UK will simply drift away from any meaningful affiliation and identification.\"\n\nJewish Women's Aid exceeded their fundraising target during their recent campaign. \"At a time when the community is rightly focusing on Israel, we are even more thankful for our recent successful fundraising campaign,\" said Ruth Wagner, director of business services at JWA, which raised over \u00a3500,000 during their 36-hour match funding campaign, titled Protect All Jewish Women From Abuse.\n\nThe money will go toward its specialist service dedicated to helping Jewish women and children affected by domestic abuse and sexual violence. \"We are here to protect all Jewish women from abuse, and the community has stood by us, which will enable us to continue our vital work,\" Wagner said.\n\nUniversity Jewish Chaplaincy's Crisis on Campus online crowdfunding campaign also surpassed the charity's fundraising goals, raising over \u00a3800,000 from over 3,000 donors, some based in student hubs in Nottingham and Scotland, as well as overseas.\n\nCharity heads said the money would be used to bolster Jewish Chaplaincy services \"amidst growing challenges on campuses\" and demonstrated \"an overwhelming show of solidarity and commitment to student welfare\".\n\nThe initiative, led by 142 dedicated \"Champions\" across the UK, was launched in response to the increasing need for support services for students combating antisemitism and anti-Zionism on campuses, which has risen significantly post October 7.\n\nUniversity Jewish Chaplaincy CEO, Sophie Dunoff, said: \"Chaplains have been going above and beyond to support students, and this campaign is a reflection of the community's deep respect and recognition of the indispensable role Chaplaincy plays in students' lives. It's a powerful endorsement of our work and the impact we have.\"\n\nThe money raised will go towards providing guidance, support and community engagement to Jewish students on campus.\n\nLast month, a World Jewish Relief fundraising dinner raised \u00a31.8 million for essential humanitarian support around the world, a large portion of which will go towards impoverished Jewish communities around eastern Europe, including Ukraine.\n\nOver the last year, WJR has assisted over 270,000 people inside Ukraine through 27 local partner organisations and supported over 20,000 Ukrainian refugees, including thousands in the UK.\n\nDuring the fundraising dinner, WJR Chair Maurice Helfgott spoke about the heartbreak both in Israel and across the international Jewish community since October 7 and emphasised the special importance of charitable giving during such difficult times.\n\n\"It is right to find the space in our heads and our hearts to be there for others... because it reflects our fundamental values,\" said Helfgott.\u202f\"It is the right thing to do, and it is the Jewish thing to do.\"",

        "text": "In a world filled with transient values and fleeting allegiances, the integrity and steadfastness of certain rare individuals stand as beacons of light, guiding others toward paths of righteousness and communal unity. At the top of the list is Coach Bruce Pearl, whose life and career embody principles that resonate deeply with the values we all should cherish. It is not merely his remarkable success as a coach that merits acclaim but, more profoundly, his unwavering dedication to his faith, his profound love for his country, and his deep respect for God's chosen land, Israel.\n\nPearl's career as a basketball coach is marked by a series of remarkable achievements that underscore his exceptional skill, strategic acumen, and leadership on the court. From his early days transforming lesser-known programs into contenders, to his tenure here at Auburn where he has completely revitalized the men's basketball program, Pearl's coaching journey is a testament to his ability to inspire excellence and foster a winning culture. In his tenure, Auburn has achieved milestones rarely seen before on The Plains, including SEC championships, NCAA tournament appearances, and an unprecedented run to the Final Four in 2019.\n\nPearl's impact however extends far beyond victories and accolades; he has been instrumental in developing players' character as men as well as their basketball skill. He instills a strong work ethic, promotes teamwork and resilience. His success as a coach is not just measured in wins, but in the lasting influence he has on his players and the broader basketball community and the Auburn Family.\n\nPearl's coaching transcends the hardwood of basketball courts; it is a testament to the power of leading by example. In a profession where success is too often gauged by win-loss records and championship titles, Pearl distinguishes himself by prioritizing the character development and spiritual well-being of his players. His constant presence at The Church of the Highlands, alongside his players, is not a formality but a sincere demonstration of faith in action. By integrating his life's work with his spiritual convictions, Pearl illustrates the impactful role of faith in leadership and community engagement.\n\nPearl's influence is mirrored by the involvement of his players in church and community activities, where they are not just church attendees and community residents but active participants in outreach and service. This engagement with the community fosters an environment where young athletes learn the importance of giving back, underscoring the idea that true victory lies in making a positive impact on the lives of others.\n\nMoreover, Bruce Pearl's love for his country and his deep affinity for Israel are emblematic of his broader worldview, one that acknowledges the significance of heritage, spiritual connection, integrity, and the belief in causes greater than oneself.\n\nA testament to Pearl the man is his Bruce Pearl Family Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting children and families facing challenging and life-altering illnesses, particularly cancer and financial hardships. The foundation raises funds for Children's Harbor and families battling cancer, providing significant contributions to various organizations like Russell Hospital Foundation and East Alabama Medical Center Foundation. Additionally, the foundation collaborates with Auburn University Athletics through initiatives like AUTLIVE to continue the fight against cancer.\n\nIn a society yearning for positive role models, Bruce Pearl stands out not just as a coach but as a mentor, a community leader, and a man of faith. His commitment to the spiritual growth and moral fortitude of his players, coupled with his patriotic zeal offers a blueprint for how sports can serve as a conduit for larger societal and spiritual lessons.\n\nAs we reflect on the ten years of contributions of Bruce Pearl to the Auburn family, we are reminded of the profound impact one individual can have when their professional excellence is matched by their personal convictions and their unwavering faith. May his example inspire others to lead with integrity, serve with compassion, and live with a deep sense of purpose, honoring both our God and the communities we are privileged to serve.",

Encouraging Australian Jewish literacy is a core value of the organisation, which also supports the SJWF, a year-long program of interactive events showcasing Jewish authors and works.\n\nAnna Stern, Deputy Director of Programs at Shalom, initiated the project. She said: \"We hope that the establishment of this award will help cultivate and support a flourishing local arts community, provide a platform for authors to receive further exposure and publicity, and award writers with a monetary prize to support their literary pursuits further.\"\n\nThe Leslie and Sophie Caplan Award for Jewish Non-Fiction has been generously donated by the Caplan Family to honour the memory of their parents, Leslie and Sophie.\n\nBoth were pillars of the Sydney Jewish community who had keen interest in modern Jewish history and literature. In thinking about their parents, Leslie and Sophie's family shared: \"Leslie and Sophie were both living embodiments of the description of the Jews as the 'People of the Book'. Inspiring the establishment of the Australian Jewish Book Award is a small and fitting tribute to them as both readers and published authors.\"\n\nSubmissions will close on 4 April. A panel of judges (writer and journalist, Julie Szego; and Jonathan Caplan, representing the Caplan Family) will judge the submissions, which must be non-fiction and fall into the categories of Jewish studies, autobiography, biography, memoir, history, or journalism. The winner will be announced in August at the SJWF.\n\nThe Plus61J Media Young Jewish Writers Award has been generously donated by Plus61J Media publisher Uri Windt. \"As a media organisation we are acutely aware of the power of words.

Therefore, the Court determined that modifications to these measures were justified.The court said that since that ruling, \"the catastrophic living conditions of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have deteriorated further, in particular, in view of the prolonged and widespread deprivation of food and other basic necessities to which the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have been subjected.\"\"Palestinians in Gaza are no longer facing only a risk of famine, as noted in the order, but that famine is setting in,\" it added.-IANSint/khz",

The purchasers of the Convertible Notes include immediate family members and family trusts related to Mark Emalfarb, our President and Chief Executive Officer and a member of our Board of Directors, including The Francisco Trust, an existing holder of more than 5% of the Company's outstanding common stock.The Company announced changes in the leadership roles of the Board and senior management team. Details of these changes are included in a separate press release issued this morning, March 28, 2024.\n\nDYAI-100 Phase 1 Clinical Trial\n\nDYAI-100, a C1-SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein RBD vaccine candidate, is the first C1-expressed protein tested in humans. The Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed as a first-in-human trial to assess the clinical safety and antibody response of DYAI-100, produced using the C1 platform and administered as a booster vaccine at two single dose levels in healthy volunteers. Following the regulatory clearance from the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA), the trial was initiated in 1Q 2023 with the last patient visit occurring in 3Q 2023. On November 29, 2023, the Company announced the top-line safety results, indicating that the study has met its primary endpoint that both the low and high dose levels of the vaccine are safe and well tolerated among participants. Additionally, the vaccine has been shown to induce immune responses at both dose levels, suggesting its potential efficacy in generating protective immunity against the target virus.\n\nBiopharmaceutical Programs\n\nOn March 25, 2024, the Company entered into a funded research collaboration with a top ten pharmaceutical company to develop a vaccine antigen and a monoclonal antibody produced from the C1 technology.\n\nOn March 15, 2024, the Company expanded its collaboration with Phibro Animal Health/Abic Biological Laboratories Ltd to develop vaccines and treatments for companion and livestock animal diseases.\n\nIn March 2024, a manuscript of preclinical studies on C1 produced monoclonal antibody in non-human primates and hamsters was published in prestigious peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications. A non-human primate challenge study completed dosing of a C1 produced COVID-19 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that had previously demonstrated broad neutralization and protection against Omicron (BA.1 and BA.2) and the other earlier variants of concern in hamsters. Preliminary results obtained from the challenge study with the SARS-CoV-2 Delta virus on non-human primates demonstrated potential high protection. This was the first time a C1-produced monoclonal antibody was used in a non-human primate study validating the safety and efficacy of a C1 produced antibody for infectious diseases.\n\nAt the NIIMBL conference in February 2024, the Company showcased our project data and research results generated from the NIIMBL Grant received by the Company under the previously announced White House's American Rescue Plan.\n\nOn February 28, 2024, the Company's Dutch subsidiary, Dyadic Nederland BV, entered into a strategic partnership agreement and collaboration with Rabian BV (\"Rabian\"), a Dutch innovative SME founded by experienced entrepreneurs and vaccine scientists. Awarded by Eurostars for the AVATAR project, a part of the European Partnership on Innovative SMEs, and co-funded by the European Union through Horizon Europe. Rabian will use the total funding of approximately \u04041.7 million leveraging its expertise in virology to develop a rabies vaccine using Dyadic's C1 protein production platform to tackle the challenges posed by rabies, particularly in lower- and middle-income countries.

        "title": "A Love Letter to 'The Jewish Holiday Table'",
        "text": "\"The Jewish Holiday Table\" is \"a love letter to our diverse culinary heritage,\" Naama Shefi told the Journal. Shefi is founder of the Jewish Food Society, a non-profit that works to preserve, celebrate and revitalize Jewish culinary heritage from around the world.\n\nIn March, Shefi and the Jewish Food Society published their first cookbook: \"The Jewish Holiday Table: A World of Recipes, Traditions & Stories to Celebrate All Year Long,\" a vibrant collection of 135 recipes and stories, with beautiful photos to match. It is as much a celebration of resilience, tradition and joy, as it is a resource for holiday cooking.\n\n\"The book celebrates Jewish holiday traditions from families around the world in places as far apart as Argentina, Hungary, India and Italy,\" Shefi, who is also founder of Asif: Culinary Institute of Israel, said.\n\n\"My good friend Mitchell Davis once said that food without a story is just calories. More than simply a recipe book, this is a book that celebrates Jewish stories and honors the rich tapestry of our heritage.\"\n\nSince 2017, the Jewish Food Society has been building the largest archive of family recipes and histories. This book is a showcase for their deep research and rich cultural food history, and includes recipes and stories that have been passed down through generations.\n\nShefi says the book was a collaborative process with her core team at Jewish Food Society. This includes co-author Devra Ferst, their archive's editor; creative director Amanda Dell and award-winning photographer Penny de Los Santos; as well as the recipe developers, testers and the featured families.\n\n\"We did a deep dive to understand where their traditions come from, how they celebrate different holidays and how they set their own tables.\" - Naama Shefi\n\n\"We did a deep dive to understand where their traditions come from, how they celebrate different holidays and how they set their own tables,\" Shefi said. \"There is nothing more powerful than hearing these stories in the families' own words.\"\n\nThe book is organized by seasons and their respective holidays, closely following the Jewish agricultural calendar. There's a Milanese Hanukkah menu, recipes for an Iraqi Purim party, a festive French Shabbat and a Moroccan Mimouna gathering to mark the end of Passover. There are also stories of a long journey via camel in Yemen, survival in Ukraine, a Bukharian grandmother on YouTube and women baking holiday sweets together in what's now Zimbabwe.\n\n\"For each holiday, we feature four to five family tables and their menu alongside a personal essay about their history and journey,\" Shefi said. \"It's more than just a collection of recipes, it's also a look at how we celebrate, and it brings to light cuisines and communities we don't hear about as often within the American Jewish community.\"\n\nFor instance, Yonit Naftali shares her beautiful Purim cakes: Beigli and Fluden.\n\n\"Yonit's grandmother was one of 10 siblings, but only four of them survived the Holocaust,\" Shefi said. \"They were left with nothing, just her mother's recipes, which she knew by heart and which she wrote down for her own children.\"\n\nShefi explains that it was important for Yonit's mother, Paula, to recreate the recipes precisely; she won't even use a machine to grind the nuts.\n\n\"As a kid growing up in Israel, Yonit noticed that these Hungarian treats were different from food being made by her predominantly Moroccan community, and at first it was a point of embarrassment,\" Shefi said. \"When she was 11, a local neighbor asked her if she would be making more for the holiday, and she soon realized that the recipes were actually a source of pride. These recipes represent a journey from loneliness and grief to acceptance and pride.\"\n\nShefi hopes \"The Jewish Holiday Table\" makes readers feel proud, connected and inspired.\n\n\"There is no one standard definition of Jewish food, but I do believe it lives at the intersection of Jewish rituals and holidays, and includes ingredients and techniques that Jewish people have encountered in 2,000 years of diaspora,\" she said. \"I also hope that home cooks discover something completely new and perfectly delicious that they bring to their holiday table for years to come.\"\n\nShe adds, \"We feel there is no one way to celebrate and we wanted to show an openness and flexibility in how to honor the past while creating new traditions.\"\n\nRinot Tzadok's Charoset Balls\n\nExcerpted from \"The Jewish Holiday Table\" by Naama Shefi and the Jewish Food Society (Artisan Books). Copyright \u00a9 2024.\n\nDuring the Passover seder, foods like bitter herbs, matzah, and charoset -- a sweet paste made from fruits and nuts -- help tell the story of the Exodus from Egypt. There are different interpretations of the symbolism of charoset, but it's most often seen as representing the mortar the Jews used for constructing buildings when they were slaves in ancient Egypt. The custom of eating charoset is ancient. As the late culinary scholar Gil Marks explained in his \"Encyclopedia of Jewish Food,\" it was widespread as early as 200 C.E.\n\nThere are countless ways to make charoset. Jewish cooks across the diaspora have prepared it with the various ingredients available to them -- apples and walnuts in Eastern Europe, dates in parts of North Africa and the Middle East. Rinat's charoset draws inspiration from both sides of her heritage. The cardamom and sesame seeds, she notes, are from her Yemenite family, while the dates, almonds and hazelnuts come from the Moroccan side. Like her mom, Rinat forms the charoset into snack-sized balls, which can be enjoyed at seder or any time as an energy snack.\n\nPreheat the oven to 300\u00b0F (150\u00b0C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper\n\nSpread the walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, and sesame seeds on the baking sheet and toast in the oven, stirring once or twice for even toasting, until aromatic and golden, about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and set the nuts aside to cool.\n\nMeanwhile, put the dates in a small heatproof bowl, cover with boiling water, and soak for 5 minutes to soften. Drain the dates thoroughly.\n\nPut the dates, walnuts, almonds, hazelnuts, sesame seeds, cinnamon, cardamom, wine, and honey in a food processor and process the mixture until it forms a paste that's uniform but not completely smooth. If the mixture seems too dry, add up to 1 tablespoon of hot water and process a bit more (but you want the mixture to be stiff enough to roll into balls). Transfer the charoset to a bowl, cover tightly, and refrigerate for at least 20 minutes, and up to overnight.\n\nTo shape the balls, coat your hands with a bit of neutral oil, scoop up a heaping teaspoon of the mixture, and roll the charoset into 1-inch (2.5 cm) balls. The charoset balls can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.\n\nArrange the charoset balls on a serving plate and serve at room temperature.",

We are excited to build on the strength of that legacy as we drive for consistent, long-term value creation.\"\n\nHsu added, \"Science and innovation are competitive advantages at Kimberly-Clark, and together they fuel our ability to meet the needs of today's consumers. Sustainability is a critical component of the Kimberly-Clark innovation strategy, and we are proud to announce our ambition to be 100% Natural Forest Free in all our products and to be more than mid-way to this goal by 2030.\"\n\nThe Kimberly-Clark Operating Model\n\nThe company will focus on driving a step-change in performance by sharpening its strategic focus through a new operating model that leverages three synergistic forces:\n\nAccelerating Pioneering Innovation to capture significant growth available in its categories by investing in science and technology to satisfy unmet and evolving consumer needs. Kimberly-Clark will focus on growing 12 powerhouse brands that have #1 or strong #2 positions and drive more than 80% of the company's net sales in five, global daily-need spaces with a total addressable market of approximately $240 billion: Baby & Child Care, Feminine Care, Adult Care, Family Care, and Professional.\n\nOptimizing its Margin Structure to deliver superior consumer propositions at every rung of the price-value ladder. The company will implement initiatives and deploy technology and data analytics designed to create a fast, adaptable, integrated supply chain with greater visibility that can deliver continuous improvement. The planned supply chain modernization is expected to generate more than $3 billion in gross productivity and $500 million in working capital savings that will be used to help fuel growth investments.\n\nWiring its Organization for Growth to drive agility, speed, and focused execution that extends the company's competitive advantages further into the future. In the coming months, the company plans to reorganize its operations into three business segments: North America : A business that currently generates approximately $11 billion in sales annually and a 23% operating profit margin that will leverage its significant scale to amplify value creation, drive an end-to-end cost transformation, and accelerate innovation into fast-moving consumer need spaces through 11 powerhouse brands across consumer and professional channels.International Personal Care (IPC): A segment with approximately $6 billion in sales annually and low-to-mid teens operating profit margins that is focused on three core categories ? Baby & Child Care, Feminine Care and Adult Care. IPC is designed to drive strong growth and improved profitability by scaling a proven growth model, with focused investments in five Core Markets that make up approximately 60% of segment sales. In the 50 Enterprise Markets that make up the balance of the business, the company will seek to improve growth trajectories, profitability and returns on investment by optimizing routes-to-market while harmonizing and simplifying product portfolios.International Family Care and Professional (IFP): A business that currently generates approximately $3.5 billion in sales annually and approximately 10% operating margins. IFP will bring together the company's international consumer tissue business with its international professional business to capture synergies and establish shared resources globally. The segment will focus on improving its business mix and profitability by growing six iconic brands in five large Family Care and five Professional markets while capturing significant margin potential by leveraging shared technology platforms, and efficiently deploying and scaling the best of its business.\n\nThese three new business segments will be supported by more efficient, world-class functions, including Research & Development, Marketing, Finance, Information Technology, and Human Resources. The company expects to complete its transition to the new organizational structure by the end of 2024. These actions are expected to generate approximately $200 million of selling, general and administrative savings in the next few years that will be available to invest back in the business.\n\n100% Natural Forest-Free Ambition\n\nSustainability is a key pillar of Kimberly-Clark's innovation pipeline, with the company focused on delivering products with enhanced consumer benefits while striving to use less material and increasing the use of more sustainable material. Over the past decade, the company has explored an extensive array of alternative fiber options, investing significantly in developing more sustainable products. Based on progress against existing goals, Kimberly-Clark is setting a new ambition to be 100% Natural Forest Free across its product portfolio. The company expects to be more than halfway to this goal by 2030.\n\nLong-Term Growth and Return Algorithm\n\nKimberly-Clark has set long-term growth and return targets that include:\n\nOrganic Net Sales growth ahead of market growth;Adjusted Operating Profit growth in the mid-to-high single digits on a constant currency basis;Adjusted EPS growth in mid-to-high single digits on a constant currency basis; andAnnual Free Cash Flow generation of at least $2 billion.\n\n\"We see a clear path to consistent growth and strong margin expansion as we sharpen our focus on areas of competitive advantage and where we believe we have the right to win,\" said Nelson Urdaneta, Chief Financial Officer. \"Leveraging our strong innovation pipeline and go-to-market capabilities to drive growth, our new productivity programs to deliver efficiencies, and our capital priorities to support reinvestment and accelerate our strategic plan will support our ability to achieve our new long-term financial profile in the years ahead.\"\n\nThe company's capital priorities have not changed. These priorities include investing to accelerate organic growth with strong returns that will strengthen the company's market positions; growing the dividend while maintaining the company's single-A credit rating; evaluating strategic acquisitions that can deliver incremental growth and return opportunities; and allocating residual capital to share repurchases, to minimally offset dilution from equity incentive programs.\n\nThe company currently expects to incur approximately $1.5 billion in one-time restructuring and reorganization costs, split roughly into 50% in non-cash charges and 50% of cash expenses, over the next three years as it implements its plans.\n\n2024 Outlook\n\nThe company noted that the outlook it provided in January is consistent with its new long-term growth and return targets. The company continues to expect to deliver a low-to-mid single-digit percentage increase in 2024 Organic Net Sales versus the prior year period, with growth in reported Net Sales forecast to reflect negative impacts of approximately 300 basis points from currency translation and 60 basis points from the Brazil Tissue divestiture. Adjusted Operating Profit is still expected to grow at a high single-digit to low double-digit rate on a constant-currency basis and Adjusted Earnings Per share are expected to grow at a high single-digit rate on a constant-currency basis versus the prior year period. Reported growth in Operating Profit and Earnings Per Share are still expected to be negatively impacted by approximately 400 basis points from currency translation.\n\nThis outlook reflects assumptions subject to change given the macro environment.\n\n2024 Investor Day Presentation\n\nThe company is hosting its Investor Day in New York City today beginning at 9 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. The event will also be webcast and accessible from the Events & Presentations section of www.kimberly-clark.com. A replay of the webcast and slides shown during the presentations will be available following the event through the same website.\n\nAbout Kimberly-Clark\n\nKimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) and its trusted brands are an indispensable part of life for people in more than 175 countries.

        "text": "Revenues at \u20ac17.5 million for the full year of 2023 up 43.4% compared to \u20ac12.2 million for 2022 Cash and cash equivalents at \u20ac26.9 million, short-term deposits at \u20ac0.01 million1, and long-term deposit at \u20ac9.0 million2 as of December 31, 2023, compared to \u20ac86.7 million, \u20ac1.0 million, and \u20ac0.7 million respectively, as of December 31, 2022 In September 2023, Inventiva entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with Hepalys to develop and commercialize lanifibranor in Japan and South Korea In January 2024, Inventiva received the second tranche of \u20ac25 million under the EIB loan agreement following its August 2023 financing of \u20ac35.7 million in gross proceeds, the upfront payment of $10 million from Hepalys in October 2023 and milestone payments from CTTQ of $5 million in 2023Estimated cash runway until the beginning of the third quarter of 20243 Positive results from the LEGEND Phase IIa study combining lanifibranor with empagliflozin in patients with MASH/NASH and T2D announced in March 2024 Last Patient First Visit of NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial with lanifibranor targeted for first half 2024\n\nDaix (France), Long Island City (New York, United States), March 27, 2024 - Inventiva (Euronext Paris and Nasdaq: IVA) (the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (\"MASH\"), also known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (\"NASH\"), and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs, today reported its full-year results for 2023.\n\nFr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cren, Chairman, CEO and cofounder of Inventiva, stated: \"Inventiva achieved several clinical and financial milestones in 2023. On the clinical front, we started the year by sharing positive topline results of the Phase II clinical trial led by Prof. Cusi, evaluating lanifibranor in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD.\n\nWe made further progress in our partnership with CTTQ to develop and commercialize, if approved, lanifibranor in China and have seen the first patients in China randomized in our ongoing pivotal NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial.\n\nWe also expanded our partnerships in Asia by entering into an exclusive agreement with Hepalys Pharma Inc. to develop and potentially commercialize lanifibranor in Japan and South Korea in September 2023. This partnership brought us a $10 million upfront payment which, in addition to the approximately \u20ac36 million gross proceeds we raised in August 2023 and the drawing of the second tranche of \u20ac25 million of the \u20ac50 million EIB loan in January 2024, we have been using to support our lanifibranor development programs.\n\nAs we have advanced our pivotal NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial, we look into the future with great optimism. Despite the previously disclosed treatment-related Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) in a patient enrolled in the trial reported in the first quarter of 2024, we have already begun to resume screening and randomization in the U.S. sites operating under central IRB. In addition, the recently announced positive results of our LEGEND Phase IIa, Proof-of-Concept clinical trial, reinforce our confidence in the potential of lanifibranor to address the multifaceted disease that is MASH. We now look forward to the first visit of the last patient in the NATiV3 study, which we expect for the first half of 2024.\"\n\nKey financial results for the full year of 2023\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company's cash and cash equivalents amounted to \u20ac26.9 million, short-term deposits to \u20ac0.01 million, and long-term deposit to \u20ac9.0 million, compared to \u20ac86.7 million, \u20ac1.0 million and \u20ac0.7 million as of December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\nThe decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term deposits between December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022 was mainly caused by the increased use of cash in operating activities. This reflects the acceleration of clinical development activities in 2023, mostly driven by costs associated with the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in MASH/NASH and, to a lesser extent, with the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with MASH/NASH and type 2 diabetes (\"T2D\"). This decrease is partially offset by:\n\nthe August 2023 financing of \u20ac35.7 million (gross amount) consisting of two transactions: a capital increase reserved to specified categories of investors through the issuance of 9,618,638 newly-issued ordinary shares at a subscription price of \u20ac3.18 per share and aggregate gross proceeds of \u20ac30.6 million, and the issuance of royalty certificates for an aggregate amount of \u20ac5.1 million, the receipt of the $10 million upfront payment from Hepalys Pharma, Inc. (\"Hepalys\") on October 18, 2023, under the exclusive licensing agreement to develop and commercialize lanifibranor for the treatment of MASH/NASH and potentially other metabolic diseases in Japan and South Korea, and the receipt of two short-term milestone payments, together amounting to a total of $5 million4 from Sino Biopharm, through its subsidiary Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. (\"CTTQ\"), following (a) receipt of the Investigational New Drug (\"IND\") by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (the \"NMPA\") and (b) the enrollment by CTTQ of the first patient in China in the Company's ongoing pivotal NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial.\n\nThe above cash, cash equivalents and deposits do not include the disbursement of the second tranche of \u20ac25 million of the unsecured loan agreement executed with the European Investment Bank (\"EIB\"), which was received on January 18, 2024. Considering its current cost structure and forecasted expenditures, the Company estimates that, including the second tranche of the EIB loan, its cash, cash equivalents and deposits should allow the Company to fund its operations as currently planned until the beginning of the third quarter of 20243. Therefore, it indicates that a material uncertainty exists on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe Company is actively reviewing potential financing (including debt, equity and equity-linked or other instruments) and strategic options with potential counterparties and its financial advisors.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities amounted to (\u20ac81.6) million for the full year 2023, compared to (\u20ac44.9) million in 2022. R&D expenses for 2023 were up 82% compared to 2022. This increase was primarily due to the clinical development activities planned for and executed in 2023, partially offset by the upfront and milestone payments received from our partners, CTTQ and Hepalys (see above).\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the full year 2023 amounted to (\u20ac7.7) million, compared to \u20ac8.9 million generated in 2022. The change was mostly due to the variations in deposits between both periods.\n\nNet cash generated from financing activities for the full year 2023 amounted to \u20ac29.1 million, compared to \u20ac37.3 million for 2022. The increase was due to the financing of \u20ac35.7 million in gross proceeds in August 2023, consisting of a reserved capital increase and the issuance of royalty certificates, partially offset by repayments of debt for \u20ac2.5 million and lease liabilities for \u20ac1.6 million. The net cash generated from financing activities in 2022 was mainly driven by the equity sold through the Company's At-The-Market Program for approximately \u20ac9.4 million (gross proceeds) in June 2022, three loan agreements with a syndicate of French banks for a total amount of \u20ac5.3 million entered into in the first half of 2022, and the receipt of the first tranche of \u20ac25 million of the unsecured loan agreement with the EIB.\n\nIn 2023, the Company recorded a positive exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac0.4 million, compared to a negative effect of (\u20ac1.0) million in 2022, due to the evolution of EUR/USD exchange rate.\n\nRevenues\n\nThe Company's revenues for 2023 amounted to \u20ac17.5 million, up by 43.4%, compared to \u20ac12.2 million in 2022.\n\nRevenues for 2023 consist mainly of i) \u20ac4.6 million, recognized under the license agreement with CTTQ mainly following the receipt of two regulatory milestone payments from CTTQ in connection with IND approval from the NMPA to initiate the clinical development in mainland China of lanifibranor in MASH/NASH and the randomization of the first patient and ii) \u20ac12.7 million recognized under the license agreement with Hepalys, consisting of the $10 million upfront payment and non-cash consideration from the fair value of the option to acquire shares of Hepalys.\n\nOther income amounted to \u20ac5.7 million for the full year 2023, as compared to \u20ac6.6 million for 2022 which represents a decrease of 14%. Other income mainly consisted of French research tax credit (credit d'imp\u00f4t recherche) for 2023 and 2022 in the amounts of \u20ac5.3 million and \u20ac5.2 million recorded in 2023 and 2022 respectively.\n\nR&D expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, amounted to (\u20ac110.0) million compared to (\u20ac60.5) million in 2022. This 82% increase reflects the planned acceleration in 2023 of the clinical development activities mostly driven by costs associated with the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in MASH/NASH, and, to a lesser extent, with the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with MASH/NASH and T2D.\n\nMarketing and business development expenses was (\u20ac2.0) million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, compared to (\u20ac2.6) million in 2022. The decrease is mainly due to less withholding tax related to entering into the license and collaboration agreements with CTTQ in 2022 and, to a lesser extent, lower consulting fees relating to the aforementioned agreements.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses (G&A) amounted to (\u20ac13.8) million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 7% compared to (\u20ac12.9) million in 2022, mainly due to increased personnel costs linked to the non-cash share-based payment expenses, and compliance fees to a lesser extent.\n\nNet financial income was (\u20ac5.1) million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, compared to \u20ac2.8 million in 2022. The net financial loss in 2023 compared to 2022 is mainly due to (i) (\u20ac4.6) million variation in loan interests expenses, (ii) (\u20ac3.8) million of net variation due to greater foreign exchange gains in 2022 compared to 2023 due to a less favorable EUR/USD exchange rate context in 2023, partially offset by revenues generated by cash investment.\n\nShare of net loss - Equity method was (\u20ac2.0) million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, due to the first equity method consolidation of Hepalys in Inventiva financial statements.\n\nIncome tax amounted to (\u20ac0.6) million for the 2023 fiscal year, compared to \u20ac0 million for 2022. This represents a partial non-cash write-off of the U.S. R&D tax credit deferred tax asset.\n\nThe Company's net loss for the full year 2023 was (\u20ac110.4), compared to (\u20ac54.3) million for 2022.\n\nThe following table presents Inventiva's income statement, prepared in accordance with IFRS, for the 2023 financial year, with comparatives for the 2022 financial year.\n\nPost-2023 events\n\nOn January 10, 2024, Inventiva announced the drawdown of the second tranche of \u20ac25 million of the unsecured loan agreement executed with the European Investment Bank on May 16, 2022. Following the drawdown, the Company issued 3,144,654 warrants to EIB.\n\nOn March 7, 2024, Inventiva announced the resumption of the screening in the Phase III NATiV3 clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in MASH/NASH after its voluntary pause following a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (\"SUSAR\") reported in a patient enrolled in the study in the first quarter of 2024. Inventiva anticipates the last patient first visit for the NATiV3 clinical trial in the first half of 2024.\n\nOn March 18, 2024, Inventiva announced positive results of its interim analysis of the LEGEND Phase IIa, Proof-of-Concept clinical trial, evaluating lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with MASH/NASH and T2D. LEGEND achieved its primary efficacy endpoint by significantly lowering HbA1c level in both the lanifibranor arm and in the lanifibranor with empagliflozin arm compared to placebo. Statistical significance was also achieved on several markers of liver injury, markers of glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as hepatic steatosis. Given that the primary endpoint of LEGEND was met, and statistically significant results were achieved on several key additional markers, the Company has decided to stop the recruitment as per protocol.\n\nImplementation of the design updates to the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in MASH/NASH announced in January 2023, to reduce the duration of the trial to 120 weeks instead of up to 7 years, reduce the number of biopsies from three to two, and include a 48-week active treatment extension study - January 2023.Decision of CTTQ to initiate the clinical development in mainland China of lanifibranor in MASH/NASH after having received an IND approval from the China's National Medical Products Administration (\"NMPA\"), triggering a milestone payment of $2 million from CTTQ to Inventiva - May 2023.Inventiva and Hepalys entered into an exclusive licensing agreement to develop and commercialize lanifibranor for the treatment of MASH/NASH in Japan and South Korea.

On the clinical front, we started the year by sharing positive topline results of the Phase II clinical trial led by Prof. Cusi, evaluating lanifibranor in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD.\n\nWe made further progress in our partnership with CTTQ to develop and commercialize, if approved, lanifibranor in China and have seen the first patients in China randomized in our ongoing pivotal NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial.\n\nWe also expanded our partnerships in Asia by entering into an exclusive agreement with Hepalys Pharma Inc. to develop and potentially commercialize lanifibranor in Japan and South Korea in September 2023. This partnership brought us a $10 million upfront payment which, in addition to the approximately \u20ac36 million gross proceeds we raised in August 2023 and the drawing of the second tranche of \u20ac25 million of the \u20ac50 million EIB loan in January 2024, we have been using to support our lanifibranor development programs.\n\nAs we have advanced our pivotal NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial, we look into the future with great optimism. Despite the previously disclosed treatment-related Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) in a patient enrolled in the trial reported in the first quarter of 2024, we have already begun to resume screening and randomization in the U.S. sites operating under central IRB. In addition, the recently announced positive results of our LEGEND Phase IIa, Proof-of-Concept clinical trial, reinforce our confidence in the potential of lanifibranor to address the multifaceted disease that is MASH. We now look forward to the first visit of the last patient in the NATiV3 study, which we expect for the first half of 2024.\"\n\nKey financial results for the full year of 2023\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company's cash and cash equivalents amounted to \u20ac26.9 million, short-term deposits to \u20ac0.01 million, and long-term deposit to \u20ac9.0 million, compared to \u20ac86.7 million, \u20ac1.0 million and \u20ac0.7 million as of December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\nThe decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term deposits between December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022 was mainly caused by the increased use of cash in operating activities. This reflects the acceleration of clinical development activities in 2023, mostly driven by costs associated with the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in MASH/NASH and, to a lesser extent, with the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with MASH/NASH and type 2 diabetes (\"T2D\"). This decrease is partially offset by:\n\nthe August 2023 financing of \u20ac35.7 million (gross amount) consisting of two transactions:a capital increase reserved to specified categories of investors through the issuance of 9,618,638 newly-issued ordinary shares at a subscription price of \u20ac3.18 per share and aggregate gross proceeds of \u20ac30.6 million, and the issuance of royalty certificates for an aggregate amount of \u20ac5.1 million, the receipt of the $10 million upfront payment from Hepalys Pharma, Inc. (\"Hepalys\") on October 18, 2023, under the exclusive licensing agreement to develop and commercialize lanifibranor for the treatment of MASH/NASH and potentially other metabolic diseases in Japan and South Korea, and the receipt of two short-term milestone payments, together amounting to a total of $5 million4 from Sino Biopharm, through its subsidiary Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. (\"CTTQ\"), following (a) receipt of the Investigational New Drug (\"IND\") by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (the \"NMPA\") and (b) the enrollment by CTTQ of the first patient in China in the Company's ongoing pivotal NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial.\n\nThe above cash, cash equivalents and deposits do not include the disbursement of the second tranche of \u20ac25 million of the unsecured loan agreement executed with the European Investment Bank (\"EIB\"), which was received on January 18, 2024. Considering its current cost structure and forecasted expenditures, the Company estimates that, including the second tranche of the EIB loan, its cash, cash equivalents and deposits should allow the Company to fund its operations as currently planned until the beginning of the third quarter of 20243. Therefore, it indicates that a material uncertainty exists on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe Company is actively reviewing potential financing (including debt, equity and equity-linked or other instruments) and strategic options with potential counterparties and its financial advisors.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities amounted to (\u20ac81.6) million for the full year 2023, compared to (\u20ac44.9) million in 2022. R&D expenses for 2023 were up 82% compared to 2022. This increase was primarily due to the clinical development activities planned for and executed in 2023, partially offset by the upfront and milestone payments received from our partners, CTTQ and Hepalys (see above).\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the full year 2023 amounted to (\u20ac7.7) million, compared to \u20ac8.9 million generated in 2022. The change was mostly due to the variations in deposits between both periods.\n\nNet cash generated from financing activities for the full year 2023 amounted to \u20ac29.1 million, compared to \u20ac37.3 million for 2022. The increase was due to the financing of \u20ac35.7 million in gross proceeds in August 2023, consisting of a reserved capital increase and the issuance of royalty certificates, partially offset by repayments of debt for \u20ac2.5 million and lease liabilities for \u20ac1.6 million. The net cash generated from financing activities in 2022 was mainly driven by the equity sold through the Company's At-The-Market Program for approximately \u20ac9.4 million (gross proceeds) in June 2022, three loan agreements with a syndicate of French banks for a total amount of \u20ac5.3 million entered into in the first half of 2022, and the receipt of the first tranche of \u20ac25 million of the unsecured loan agreement with the EIB.\n\nIn 2023, the Company recorded a positive exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac0.4 million, compared to a negative effect of (\u20ac1.0) million in 2022, due to the evolution of EUR/USD exchange rate.\n\nRevenues\n\nThe Company's revenues for 2023 amounted to \u20ac17.5 million, up by 43.4%, compared to \u20ac12.2 million in 2022.\n\nRevenues for 2023 consist mainly of i) \u20ac4.6 million, recognized under the license agreement with CTTQ mainly following the receipt of two regulatory milestone payments from CTTQ in connection with IND approval from the NMPA to initiate the clinical development in mainland China of lanifibranor in MASH/NASH and the randomization of the first patient and ii) \u20ac12.7 million recognized under the license agreement with Hepalys, consisting of the $10 million upfront payment and non-cash consideration from the fair value of the option to acquire shares of Hepalys.\n\nOther income amounted to \u20ac5.7 million for the full year 2023, as compared to \u20ac6.6 million for 2022 which represents a decrease of 14%. Other income mainly consisted of French research tax credit (credit d'imp\u00f4t recherche) for 2023 and 2022 in the amounts of \u20ac5.3 million and \u20ac5.2 million recorded in 2023 and 2022 respectively.\n\nR&D expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, amounted to (\u20ac110.0) million compared to (\u20ac60.5) million in 2022. This 82% increase reflects the planned acceleration in 2023 of the clinical development activities mostly driven by costs associated with the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in MASH/NASH, and, to a lesser extent, with the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with MASH/NASH and T2D.\n\nMarketing and business development expenses was (\u20ac2.0) million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, compared to (\u20ac2.6) million in 2022. The decrease is mainly due to less withholding tax related to entering into the license and collaboration agreements with CTTQ in 2022 and, to a lesser extent, lower consulting fees relating to the aforementioned agreements.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses(G&A) amounted to (\u20ac13.8) million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 7% compared to (\u20ac12.9) million in 2022, mainly due to increased personnel costs linked to the non-cash share-based payment expenses, and compliance fees to a lesser extent.\n\nNet financial income was (\u20ac5.1) million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, compared to \u20ac2.8 million in 2022. The net financial loss in 2023 compared to 2022 is mainly due to (i) (\u20ac4.6) million variation in loan interests expenses, (ii) (\u20ac3.8) million of net variation due to greater foreign exchange gains in 2022 compared to 2023 due to a less favorable EUR/USD exchange rate context in 2023, partially offset by revenues generated by cash investment.\n\nShare of net loss - Equity method was (\u20ac2.0) million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, due to the first equity method consolidation of Hepalys in Inventiva financial statements.\n\nIncome tax amounted to (\u20ac0.6) million for the 2023 fiscal year, compared to \u20ac0 million for 2022. This represents a partial non-cash write-off of the U.S. R&D tax credit deferred tax asset.\n\nThe Company's net loss for the full year 2023 was (\u20ac110.4), compared to (\u20ac54.3) million for 2022.\n\nThe following table presents Inventiva's income statement, prepared in accordance with IFRS, for the 2023 financial year, with comparatives for the 2022 financial year.\n\n(in thousands of euros) Year ended Dec. 31, 2023Dec. 31, 2022Revenues 17,477 12,179 Other income 5,686 6,635 Research and development expenses (110,012) (60,469) Marketing - business development expenses (1,980) (2,583) General and administrative expenses (13,837) (12,912) Other operating income (expenses) (44) 40 Net operating loss (102,709) (57,110)Net financial income (5,095) 2,816 Share of net loss - Equity method (2,015) - Income tax (607) 20 Net loss for the period (110,426) (54,274) Basic/diluted loss per share (euros/share) (2.43) (1.31) Weighted average number of outstanding shares used for computing basic/diluted loss per share 45,351,799 41,449,732\n\nPost-2023 events\n\nOn January 10, 2024, Inventiva announced the drawdown of the second tranche of \u20ac25 million of the unsecured loan agreement executed with the European Investment Bank on May 16, 2022. Following the drawdown, the Company issued 3,144,654 warrants to EIB.\n\nOn March 7, 2024, Inventiva announced the resumption of the screening in the Phase III NATiV3 clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in MASH/NASH after its voluntary pause following a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (\"SUSAR\") reported in a patient enrolled in the study in the first quarter of 2024. Inventiva anticipates the last patient first visit for the NATiV3 clinical trial in the first half of 2024.\n\nOn March 18, 2024, Inventiva announced positive results of its interim analysis of the LEGEND Phase IIa, Proof-of-Concept clinical trial, evaluating lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with MASH/NASH and T2D. LEGEND achieved its primary efficacy endpoint by significantly lowering HbA1c level in both the lanifibranor arm and in the lanifibranor with empagliflozin arm compared to placebo. Statistical significance was also achieved on several markers of liver injury, markers of glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as hepatic steatosis. Given that the primary endpoint of LEGEND was met, and statistically significant results were achieved on several key additional markers, the Company has decided to stop the recruitment as per protocol.\n\nMain areas of progress in the R&D portfolio\n\nLanifibranor in MASH/NASH\n\nImplementation of the design updates to the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in MASH/NASH announced in January 2023, to reduce the duration of the trial to 120 weeks instead of up to 7 years, reduce the number of biopsies from three to two, and include a 48-week active treatment extension study - January 2023.Decision of CTTQ to initiate the clinical development in mainland China of lanifibranor in MASH/NASH after having received an IND approval from the China's National Medical Products Administration (\"NMPA\"), triggering a milestone payment of $2 million from CTTQ to Inventiva - May 2023.Inventiva and Hepalys entered into an exclusive licensing agreement to develop and commercialize lanifibranor for the treatment of MASH/NASH in Japan and South Korea.

On the clinical front, we started the year by sharing positive topline results of the Phase II clinical trial led by Prof. Cusi, evaluating lanifibranor in patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD.\n\nWe made further progress in our partnership with CTTQ to develop and commercialize, if approved, lanifibranor in China and have seen the first patients in China randomized in our ongoing pivotal NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial.\n\nWe also expanded our partnerships in Asia by entering into an exclusive agreement with Hepalys Pharma Inc. to develop and potentially commercialize lanifibranor in Japan and South Korea in September 2023. This partnership brought us a $10 million upfront payment which, in addition to the approximately \u20ac36 million gross proceeds we raised in August 2023 and the drawing of the second tranche of \u20ac25 million of the \u20ac50 million EIB loan in January 2024, we have been using to support our lanifibranor development programs.\n\nAs we have advanced our pivotal NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial, we look into the future with great optimism. Despite the previously disclosed treatment-related Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) in a patient enrolled in the trial reported in the first quarter of 2024, we have already begun to resume screening and randomization in the U.S. sites operating under central IRB. In addition, the recently announced positive results of our LEGEND Phase IIa, Proof-of-Concept clinical trial, reinforce our confidence in the potential of lanifibranor to address the multifaceted disease that is MASH. We now look forward to the first visit of the last patient in the NATiV3 study, which we expect for the first half of 2024.\"\n\nKey financial results for the full year of 2023\n\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company's cash and cash equivalents amounted to \u20ac26.9 million, short-term deposits to \u20ac0.01 million, and long-term deposit to \u20ac9.0 million, compared to \u20ac86.7 million, \u20ac1.0 million and \u20ac0.7 million as of December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\nThe decrease in cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term deposits between December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022 was mainly caused by the increased use of cash in operating activities. This reflects the acceleration of clinical development activities in 2023, mostly driven by costs associated with the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in MASH/NASH and, to a lesser extent, with the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with MASH/NASH and type 2 diabetes (\"T2D\"). This decrease is partially offset by:\n\nthe August 2023 financing of \u20ac35.7 million (gross amount) consisting of two transactions: a capital increase reserved to specified categories of investors through the issuance of 9,618,638 newly-issued ordinary shares at a subscription price of \u20ac3.18 per share and aggregate gross proceeds of \u20ac30.6 million, and the issuance of royalty certificates for an aggregate amount of \u20ac5.1 million, the receipt of the $10 million upfront payment from Hepalys Pharma, Inc. (\"Hepalys\") on October 18, 2023, under the exclusive licensing agreement to develop and commercialize lanifibranor for the treatment of MASH/NASH and potentially other metabolic diseases in Japan and South Korea, and the receipt of two short-term milestone payments, together amounting to a total of $5 million4 from Sino Biopharm, through its subsidiary Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. (\"CTTQ\"), following (a) receipt of the Investigational New Drug (\"IND\") by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (the \"NMPA\") and (b) the enrollment by CTTQ of the first patient in China in the Company's ongoing pivotal NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial.\n\nThe above cash, cash equivalents and deposits do not include the disbursement of the second tranche of \u20ac25 million of the unsecured loan agreement executed with the European Investment Bank (\"EIB\"), which was received on January 18, 2024. Considering its current cost structure and forecasted expenditures, the Company estimates that, including the second tranche of the EIB loan, its cash, cash equivalents and deposits should allow the Company to fund its operations as currently planned until the beginning of the third quarter of 20243. Therefore, it indicates that a material uncertainty exists on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nThe Company is actively reviewing potential financing (including debt, equity and equity-linked or other instruments) and strategic options with potential counterparties and its financial advisors.\n\nNet cash used in operating activities amounted to (\u20ac81.6) million for the full year 2023, compared to (\u20ac44.9) million in 2022. R&D expenses for 2023 were up 82% compared to 2022. This increase was primarily due to the clinical development activities planned for and executed in 2023, partially offset by the upfront and milestone payments received from our partners, CTTQ and Hepalys (see above).\n\nNet cash used in investing activities for the full year 2023 amounted to (\u20ac7.7) million, compared to \u20ac8.9 million generated in 2022. The change was mostly due to the variations in deposits between both periods.\n\nLoading...Loading...\n\nNet cash generated from financing activities for the full year 2023 amounted to \u20ac29.1 million, compared to \u20ac37.3 million for 2022. The increase was due to the financing of \u20ac35.7 million in gross proceeds in August 2023, consisting of a reserved capital increase and the issuance of royalty certificates, partially offset by repayments of debt for \u20ac2.5 million and lease liabilities for \u20ac1.6 million. The net cash generated from financing activities in 2022 was mainly driven by the equity sold through the Company's At-The-Market Program for approximately \u20ac9.4 million (gross proceeds) in June 2022, three loan agreements with a syndicate of French banks for a total amount of \u20ac5.3 million entered into in the first half of 2022, and the receipt of the first tranche of \u20ac25 million of the unsecured loan agreement with the EIB.\n\nIn 2023, the Company recorded a positive exchange rate effect on cash and cash equivalents of \u20ac0.4 million, compared to a negative effect of (\u20ac1.0) million in 2022, due to the evolution of EUR/USD exchange rate.\n\nRevenues\n\nThe Company's revenues for 2023 amounted to \u20ac17.5 million, up by 43.4%, compared to \u20ac12.2 million in 2022.\n\nRevenues for 2023 consist mainly of i) \u20ac4.6 million, recognized under the license agreement with CTTQ mainly following the receipt of two regulatory milestone payments from CTTQ in connection with IND approval from the NMPA to initiate the clinical development in mainland China of lanifibranor in MASH/NASH and the randomization of the first patient and ii) \u20ac12.7 million recognized under the license agreement with Hepalys, consisting of the $10 million upfront payment and non-cash consideration from the fair value of the option to acquire shares of Hepalys.\n\nOther income amounted to \u20ac5.7 million for the full year 2023, as compared to \u20ac6.6 million for 2022 which represents a decrease of 14%. Other income mainly consisted of French research tax credit (credit d'imp\u00f4t recherche) for 2023 and 2022 in the amounts of \u20ac5.3 million and \u20ac5.2 million recorded in 2023 and 2022 respectively.\n\nR&D expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, amounted to (\u20ac110.0) million compared to (\u20ac60.5) million in 2022. This 82% increase reflects the planned acceleration in 2023 of the clinical development activities mostly driven by costs associated with the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial of lanifibranor in MASH/NASH, and, to a lesser extent, with the LEGEND Phase IIa combination trial with lanifibranor and empagliflozin in patients with MASH/NASH and T2D.\n\nMarketing and business development expenses was (\u20ac2.0) million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, compared to (\u20ac2.6) million in 2022. The decrease is mainly due to less withholding tax related to entering into the license and collaboration agreements with CTTQ in 2022 and, to a lesser extent, lower consulting fees relating to the aforementioned agreements.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses (G&A) amounted to (\u20ac13.8) million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, an increase of 7% compared to (\u20ac12.9) million in 2022, mainly due to increased personnel costs linked to the non-cash share-based payment expenses, and compliance fees to a lesser extent.\n\nNet financial income was (\u20ac5.1) million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, compared to \u20ac2.8 million in 2022. The net financial loss in 2023 compared to 2022 is mainly due to (i) (\u20ac4.6) million variation in loan interests expenses, (ii) (\u20ac3.8) million of net variation due to greater foreign exchange gains in 2022 compared to 2023 due to a less favorable EUR/USD exchange rate context in 2023, partially offset by revenues generated by cash investment.\n\nShare of net loss - Equity method was (\u20ac2.0) million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, due to the first equity method consolidation of Hepalys in Inventiva financial statements.\n\nIncome tax amounted to (\u20ac0.6) million for the 2023 fiscal year, compared to \u20ac0 million for 2022. This represents a partial non-cash write-off of the U.S. R&D tax credit deferred tax asset.\n\nThe Company's net loss for the full year 2023 was (\u20ac110.4), compared to (\u20ac54.3) million for 2022.\n\nThe following table presents Inventiva's income statement, prepared in accordance with IFRS, for the 2023 financial year, with comparatives for the 2022 financial year.\n\nPost-2023 events\n\nOn January 10, 2024, Inventiva announced the drawdown of the second tranche of \u20ac25 million of the unsecured loan agreement executed with the European Investment Bank on May 16, 2022. Following the drawdown, the Company issued 3,144,654 warrants to EIB.\n\nOn March 7, 2024, Inventiva announced the resumption of the screening in the Phase III NATiV3 clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in MASH/NASH after its voluntary pause following a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (\"SUSAR\") reported in a patient enrolled in the study in the first quarter of 2024. Inventiva anticipates the last patient first visit for the NATiV3 clinical trial in the first half of 2024.\n\nOn March 18, 2024, Inventiva announced positive results of its interim analysis of the LEGEND Phase IIa, Proof-of-Concept clinical trial, evaluating lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with MASH/NASH and T2D. LEGEND achieved its primary efficacy endpoint by significantly lowering HbA1c level in both the lanifibranor arm and in the lanifibranor with empagliflozin arm compared to placebo. Statistical significance was also achieved on several markers of liver injury, markers of glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as hepatic steatosis. Given that the primary endpoint of LEGEND was met, and statistically significant results were achieved on several key additional markers, the Company has decided to stop the recruitment as per protocol.\n\nMain areas of progress in the R&D portfolio\n\nLanifibranor in MASH/NASH\n\nImplementation of the design updates to the NATiV3 Phase III clinical trial evaluating lanifibranor in MASH/NASH announced in January 2023, to reduce the duration of the trial to 120 weeks instead of up to 7 years, reduce the number of biopsies from three to two, and include a 48-week active treatment extension study - January 2023.Decision of CTTQ to initiate the clinical development in mainland China of lanifibranor in MASH/NASH after having received an IND approval from the China's National Medical Products Administration (\"NMPA\"), triggering a milestone payment of $2 million from CTTQ to Inventiva - May 2023.Inventiva and Hepalys entered into an exclusive licensing agreement to develop and commercialize lanifibranor for the treatment of MASH/NASH in Japan and South Korea.

        "text": "THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF RACING FORCE S.P.A. APPROVED DRAFT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2023 AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2023\n\nRonco Scrivia (GE, Italy), March 27, 2024 - The Board of Directors of Racing Force S.p.A. (\"Company\" or \"RFG\"), the parent company of Racing Force Group, which is specialized in the development, production and marketing of safety components for motorsports competitions worldwide, as well as listed on the Euronext Growth Milan (RFG) and Paris segments (ALRFG), reviewed and approved the draft financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and the consolidated financial statements for 2023, prepared in accordance with international accounting standards.\n\nPaolo Delprato, Chairman and CEO of Racing Force Group, commented: \"This fiscal year has been characterized by significant investments aimed at further strengthening the organizational structure of the Group and increasing production and logistical capacity, to support the expected growth in the coming years, both in motorsport and as a result of diversification projects currently under implementation. The investment plan launched at the end of 2022 is progressing and is set to be completed by Q1 of the next fiscal year, positioning the Group ready to seize the significant opportunities which are emerging.\n\nDespite a macroeconomic context marked by strong uncertainty, with high inflation rates and credit restrictions that did not support market demand, during 2023 the Group managed to achieve significant results, particularly in Europe, Asia, and Oceania. In the United States, some primary dealers adopted destocking policies during the year, which affected sales, mainly in the second half of the year. Nevertheless, the Group was able to increase its market share, even in the American market, where we expect significant growth over the next few years, thanks to the strengthening strategy implemented.\n\nThe level of orders collected in the first quarter of 2024 on a global scale, marking an unprecedented peak, confirms our growth expectations for the current season.\n\nThe implemented strategies and the continuous commitment of all the people at Racing Force, starting from our technicians within the R&D laboratories at the main headquarters of the Group, will enable to achieve increasingly significant results in the upcoming periods\".\n\nSummary of Group Results as of December 31, 2023\n\nThe increase characterized particularly the geographical areas of EMEA (+11.2%) and APAC (+15.0%), while the Americas recorded a decline (-7.8%), mainly due to a one-off supply to a customer outside motorsport carried out during the previous year, and due to the weaking of the dollar against euro. Excluding these effects, growth in Americas would be of 4.6%.\n\nDealers are confirmed as the primary sales channel for the Group (62.1% of revenues), while Driver's Equipment represents the main category in terms of product type (71.9 % of revenues), thanks to the increase recorded by all the main racewear products offered by the Group.\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nThe global economy decelerated in 2023, mainly due to high inflation and restrictions in financing conditions. The strong geopolitical uncertainty, caused by the conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine and, starting from the end of 2023, also by the conflict between Israel and Palestine, further worsened the market environment.\n\nIn this scenario, the Group recorded +6.4% growth in sales during the year, compared to the previous period (+7.0% at constant exchange rates), thanks particularly to the excellent results achieved on the European market (+11.2%) and the continuous growth in Asia Pacific (+15.0%), regions where the Group has further consolidated its leadership position and which represent 76% of the Group's total sales.\n\nEven in the Americas, despite lower sales compared to the previous year, due to a one-supply made in 2022 and weak demand coupled with the destocking policies implemented by some dealers during 2023, the Group increased its market share.\n\nThe increase in revenues during the fiscal year was mainly due to the driver's equipment product category, driven by the increase in sales of racing suits, non-technical apparel and communication systems.\n\nGross profit registered an increase in absolute value of \u20ac1.9 million compared to fiscal year 2022. In percentage terms, a slight decrease of 0.8% was recorded, mainly due to the different composition of the mix of sales and the volatility in the costs of some raw materials.\n\nDuring the fiscal year, the Group made significant investmentsto increase production and logistics capacity to support the growth within motorsport and, particularly, to carry on the diversification projects, currently underway.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses, in detail, registered an increase of \u20ac2.7 compared to 2022, mainly due to the higher number of employees within the Group (+90 units employed on average during 2023 compared to the previous year).This increase was necessary in order to timely set up the proper organizational structure and production capacity, required to support both the activities within motorsport and the diversification projects.\n\nThe current capital structure is such as to allow investments in the coming future to further support the Group's growth plan, both within motorsport and as regards the diversification projects.\n\nCurrent trading\n\nSales at the beginning of 2024 are in line with the previous year, maintaining stability in the main geographic areas of operation, except for non-technical apparel under the Racing Spirit brand which registered a decrease compared to the first months of 2023, mainly due to the deliveries made at the beginning of the previous year to two important customers covering the entire season.\n\nOrders received from customers in the first months of the year increased significantly compared to the same period of the previous year.\n\nThe approval of a new FIA safety standard for helmets, effective upon the first homologation of a compliant model by a manufacturer, entails the risk of potential effects on demand in the first part of 2024, particularly from dealers, waiting for the new models, with the expectation of a strong acceleration in sales once the new homologated helmets will be available. For this reason, the development of helmets compliant with the new standard, with the aim of having a large quantity in stock by the end of 2024, is a crucial element to achieve the growth targets set for the Bell brand and gaining new market share. To date, testing activities underway at the R&D center in Bahrain, which is unique in the competitive landscape, are particularly positive.\n\nIn addition, a new Snell homologation standard for helmets distributed on the US market is scheduled to come into force in autumn 2025. The introduction of new safety standards has always been a technological challenge and, at the same time, an important growth opportunity for the Group.\n\nWith reference to other main product categories, both Car parts and Driver's Equipment are expected to benefit from the technical partnership agreement in place for the season, starting with the new agreement signed at the beginning of the year with Penske Team, one of the main American teams racing in Nascar and Indycar.\n\nFollowing the consolidation of the Group's structure during 2023, to support the expected growth in motorsport and with the aim of supporting the implementation of diversification projects, the Group's priority for the coming periods, together with the growth in turnover, is to achieve an efficiency increase in the structure with a positive impact on marginality.\n\nThe development of the diversification projects, with initial results expected between late 2024 and Q1 2025, is progressing as planned.\n\nThe prolonged war between Russia and Ukraine, coupled with escalating tensions in the Middle East, contributes to maintaining a high level of geo-political risk worldwide, generating significant uncertainty on the global economy and businesses. As of today, marginal effects impacted the Group's operating results, however it will be necessary to continue monitoring the situation's progression throughout the year.\n\nAllocation of net result\n\nThe Board of Directors of Racing Force S.p.A. has proposed to the Shareholders' Meeting to allocate the net profit for fiscal year 2023, amounting to 2,565,413 euro, as follows:\n\n- \u20ac2,312,928 to dividends to be distributed, amounting to \u20ac0.09 per share, before withholding tax, with an ex-dividend date of May 13th, 2024, in accordance with the Euronext Growth Milan calendar, an entitlement date of May 14th, 2024 and a dividend payment date of May 15th, 2024;\n\nWith regard to the first tranche (\"First Tranche\") of the incentive plan \"Stock Grant Plan 2023-2025\" (the \"Plan\"), the Board of Directors noted that the objective outlined in the Plan concerning the minimum increase in consolidated adjusted EBITDA compared to the previous fiscal year has not been achieved, therefore the rights have not accrued.\n\nConcerning the second tranche of the Plan (the \"Second Tranche\"), the Board of Directors (i) has nominatively identified the beneficiaries of the Plan (\"Beneficiaries\") and (ii) determined the maximum number of rights to receive ordinary shares of RFG for each of them, according to the terms and conditions of the Regulations (\"Rights\"), as well as (iii) established the performance targets upon which the allocation of shares to each Beneficiary will be conditional, pursuant to the same Regulations (the \"Objectives\").\n\nIn particular, the Board of Directors has set the quantity of Rights to be allocated to the Beneficiaries for the Second Tranche at a maximum of 223,765 out of a total of 1,000,000 Rights assignable overall under the Plan, corresponding to 223,765 shares of the Company. For further details regarding the Plan, please refer to the Information Document already made available to the public on the Company's website at www.racingforce.com, in the Investor Relations/Shareholders' Meetings section.\n\nProposal to the shareholders' meeting for authorization to purchase and dispose of own shares by the Company pursuant to articles 2357 et seq. of the Italian Civil Code\n\nThe Board of Directors of Racing Force has resolved to submit to the approval of the Shareholders' Meeting the proposal for authorization to purchase and dispose of own shares. The proposal aims to provide the Company with a valuable strategic investment opportunity for any purpose permitted by current European and national regulations, including the purposes envisaged in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 596/2014 (Market Abuse Regulation, hereinafter \"MAR\") and related implementing provisions, where applicable, and in market practices permitted under Article 13 of the MAR, for the following purposes, merely by way of example and not exhaustively: (i) to support the liquidity of the shares themselves; (ii) to allow efficient use of the Company's liquidity for medium and long-term investments; (iii) to use own shares in operations connected with the ordinary business or projects consistent with the Company's strategic lines; (iv) to have own shares available to be allocated for the \"Stock Grant Plan 2023-2025\", as well as for any future incentive plans, (v) to have own shares available as consideration in the context of any extraordinary operations, in accordance with the strategic lines that the Company intends to pursue.

For this reason, the development of helmets compliant with the new standard, with the aim of having a large quantity in stock by the end of 2024, is a crucial element to achieve the growth targets set for the Bell brand and gaining new market share. To date, testing activities underway at the R&D center in Bahrain, which is unique in the competitive landscape, are particularly positive.\n\nIn addition, a new Snell homologation standard for helmets distributed on the US market is scheduled to come into force in autumn 2025. The introduction of new safety standards has always been a technological challenge and, at the same time, an important growth opportunity for the Group.\n\nWith reference to other main product categories, both Car parts and Driver's Equipment are expected to benefit from the technical partnership agreement in place for the season, starting with the new agreement signed at the beginning of the year with Penske Team, one of the main American teams racing in Nascar and Indycar.\n\nFollowing the consolidation of the Group's structure during 2023, to support the expected growth in motorsport and with the aim of supporting the implementation of diversification projects, the Group's priority for the coming periods, together with the growth in turnover, is to achieve an efficiency increase in the structure with a positive impact on marginality.\n\nThe development of the diversification projects, with initial results expected between late 2024 and Q1 2025, is progressing as planned.\n\nThe prolonged war between Russia and Ukraine, coupled with escalating tensions in the Middle East, contributes to maintaining a high level of geo-political risk worldwide, generating significant uncertainty on the global economy and businesses. As of today, marginal effects impacted the Group's operating results, however it will be necessary to continue monitoring the situation's progression throughout the year.\n\nAllocation of net result\n\nThe Board of Directors of Racing Force S.p.A. has proposed to the Shareholders' Meeting to allocate the net profit for fiscal year 2023, amounting to 2,565,413 euro, as follows:\n\n- \u20ac2,312,928 to dividends to be distributed, amounting to \u20ac0.09 per share, before withholding tax, with an ex-dividend date of May 13th, 2024, in accordance with the Euronext Growth Milan calendar, an entitlement date of May 14th, 2024 and a dividend payment date of May 15th, 2024;\n\nWith regard to the first tranche (\"First Tranche\") of the incentive plan \"Stock Grant Plan 2023-2025\" (the \"Plan\"), the Board of Directors noted that the objective outlined in the Plan concerning the minimum increase in consolidated adjusted EBITDA compared to the previous fiscal year has not been achieved, therefore the rights have not accrued.\n\nConcerning the second tranche of the Plan (the \"Second Tranche\"), the Board of Directors (i) has nominatively identified the beneficiaries of the Plan (\"Beneficiaries\") and (ii) determined the maximum number of rights to receive ordinary shares of RFG for each of them, according to the terms and conditions of the Regulations (\"Rights\"), as well as (iii) established the performance targets upon which the allocation of shares to each Beneficiary will be conditional, pursuant to the same Regulations (the \"Objectives\").\n\nIn particular, the Board of Directors has set the quantity of Rights to be allocated to the Beneficiaries for the Second Tranche at a maximum of 223,765 out of a total of 1,000,000 Rights assignable overall under the Plan, corresponding to 223,765 shares of the Company.

(Israel), Dun & Bradstreet (US)\n\nMake an Enquiry @ https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=94223554\n\nDue to various business drivers, the Customer Data Platform (CDP) market is expected to grow significantly during the forecast period. The market is experiencing significant growth due to increasing data volume and complexity, growing regulatory compliance requirements, shift toward data-driven marketing and advertising. The need to deliver omnichannel experience, changing landscape of customer intelligence, and proliferation of customer channels is also responsible for driving the market's growth.\n\nA CDP is a customer data personalization management system that creates a persistent, unified customer database accessible to other systems. It provides an environment that can ensure the most up-to-date, precise, and complete view of customers. This will help organizations make better decisions on how, when, and why to interact with customers. It consolidates and integrates data from multiple heterogeneous sources with a single, trusted repository that supplies accurate customer data to analytical and operational systems throughout the marketing and technology stack.\n\nBased on the offering, the Customer Data Platform (CDP) market is segmented into platform and services. The platform segment is expected to garner a higher revenue during the forecast period. Most CDP solution providers offer a software package or a platform that integrates customer data from different channels, including eCommerce, point of sale, email sign-up, and product registration, into a single database to provide a 360\u00b0 customer view. To design omnichannel marketing strategies, they use customer analytics and predictive models, such as recency, sales pipeline, forecasting, frequency, monetary analysis, lifetime spend, and customer/prospect ratio.\n\nBased on solutions by deployment mode, the segment has been bifurcated in cloud and on-premises. The on-premises segment is expected to garner a higher revenue during the forecast period. On-premises solutions provide organizations with full control over all platforms and systems, which can be handled and managed by their IT staff. The on-premises deployment mode remains the most flexible option concerning customization and data analytics. Compared with the cloud delivery mode, the on-premises deployment mode is more expensive and requires specialized software, hardware, and skilled employees to implement and manage CDP solutions. However, many marketing organizations are still cautious about cloud-based deployments' data security and privacy issues. Therefore, they prefer the on-premises mode over the cloud.\n\nLoading...Loading...\n\nRequest Sample Pages @ https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/requestsampleNew.asp?id=94223554\n\nBased on data channel, the segment has been bifurcated into Email, social media, SMS, web, push messaging, and other data channels (direct mail, ad network). The Email segment is expected to garner a higher revenue during the forecast period. The Email data channel segment within the Customer Data Platform (CDP) market has experienced significant growth driven by several key factors. The increasing importance of personalized marketing strategies has propelled the demand for CDPs that can effectively integrate and utilize email data. Businesses recognize the value of leveraging email data to tailor their communications and enhance customer engagement. The rising adoption of automation and AI technologies has further fueled growth in this segment.\n\nThe Customer Data Platform (CDP) market has been segmented into five regions: North America, Europe, the Middle East & Africa, the Asia Pacific, and Latin America. The increasing technological advancements favor the growth of the Customer Data Platform (CDP) market in North America. The growing number of CDP players across regions is expected to further drive the market growth. The adoption of CDPs is increasing rapidly, owing to their data management benefits. The Customer Data Platform (CDP) market is expected to witness fast growth in the coming years due to the improved application functionality of CDPs and enhanced technologies. Europe is expected to hold the second-largest market size during the forecast period due to the awareness of regulations related to CDP among businesses.\n\nBrowse Adjacent Markets: Analytics Market Research Reports & Consulting\n\nBrowse Other Reports:\n\nSocial Media Analytics Market\n\nAudio Communication Monitoring Market\n\nEvent Management Software Market\n\nCritical Infrastructure Protection Market\n\nDigital Payment Market\n\nAbout MarketsandMarkets\u2122 MarketsandMarkets\u2122 has been recognized as one of America's best management consulting firms by Forbes, as per their recent report.

I feel very honoured, it motivates me to continue and makes me happy. I also look forward to playing with the outstanding Hall\u00e9 Orchestra and getting to know its musicians better. I know about the history and the tragic life of Terence and after receiving this award I became immensely touched with the feeling that he started breathing in me and now I have a duty to fulfil his ideas and dreams.\"\n\nDavid Butcher, Hall\u00e9 chief executive, added: \"We are delighted to announce Giorgi Gigashvili as this year's recipient of the Terence Judd-Hall\u00e9 Award, continuing the memory of one of our nation's most exceptional young pianists and continuing our flourishing partnership with BBC Radio 3. I am very much looking forward to welcoming Giorgi to Manchester and enjoying his Hall\u00e9 debuts at The Bridgewater Hall and Hall\u00e9 St Peter's during the 2024-25 Season.\"\n\nSam Jackson, controller BBC Radio 3 and BBC Proms, said: \"The BBC New Generation Artists scheme turns 25 this year. Since 1999, we have nurtured and promoted over 100 young instrumentalists, singers and ensembles at the start of their international careers, through studio recordings, commissions of new work, broadcasts on BBC Radio 3 and performances at venues and festivals all over the country.\n\nOur partnership with the Hall\u00e9 has been crucial, and we congratulate Giorgi Gigashvili on being the next recipient of the Terence Judd-Hall\u00e9 Award. The ongoing link between the New Generation Artists scheme and the Hall\u00e9 will create further opportunities for collaboration with outstanding musicians, providing memorable experiences for audiences both in the concert hall and on BBC Radio 3.\"\n\nTerence Judd was a remarkably gifted British pianist who passed away aged 22 as he was about to embark on a historic tour of the Soviet Union. A trust was established in 1982, and for over four decades, the Terence Judd-Hall\u00e9 award has been presented in his honour. Celebrated pianists such as Sir Stephen Hough, Nikolai Lugansky, Elisabeth Brauss, and last year's recipient, Tom Borrow, have been notable beneficiaries of the award.",

        "text": "Announces Strong Long-Term Growth & Return Algorithm with Organic Net Sales Growth Ahead of Market Growth and Adjusted EPS Growth in Mid-to-High Single Digits\n\nTargets More Than $3 Billion in Gross Productivity Savings and Approximately $500 Million in Working Capital Savings\n\nCommits to 100% Natural Forest Free Ambition Across Product Portfolio\n\nDALLAS, March 27, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Kimberly-Clark Corporation (NYSE: KMB) announced that today, Mike Hsu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and members of his executive leadership team are unveiling the next phase of the company's transformation, including a new operating model and key commercial initiatives designed to grow its brands and businesses at a faster pace than its categories.\n\n\"Over the past five years, our global team's dedication and strong execution have positioned us to fully leverage the scale we've built and to catapult Kimberly-Clark into its next chapter of growth,\" said Hsu. \"We are building on the consumer centricity and commercial advantages we've established by moving to a more agile and focused operating structure that we are confident will help accelerate our proprietary pipeline of innovation in right-to-win spaces and improve our growth trajectory, profitability, and returns on investment. We have more than 150 years of history, transforming groundbreaking insights into innovative categories, with products that provide Better Care for a Better World. We are excited to build on the strength of that legacy as we drive for consistent, long-term value creation.\"\n\nHsu added, \"Science and innovation are competitive advantages at Kimberly-Clark, and together they fuel our ability to meet the needs of today's consumers. Sustainability is a critical component of the Kimberly-Clark innovation strategy, and we are proud to announce our ambition to be 100% Natural Forest Free in all our products and to be more than mid-way to this goal by 2030.\"\n\nThe Kimberly-Clark Operating Model\n\nThe company will focus on driving a step-change in performance by sharpening its strategic focus through a new operating model that leverages three synergistic forces:\n\nThese three new business segments will be supported by more efficient, world-class functions, including Research & Development, Marketing, Finance, Information Technology, and Human Resources. The company expects to complete its transition to the new organizational structure by the end of 2024. These actions are expected to generate approximately $200 million of selling, general and administrative savings in the next few years that will be available to invest back in the business.\n\n100% Natural Forest-Free Ambition\n\nSustainability is a key pillar of Kimberly-Clark's innovation pipeline, with the company focused on delivering products with enhanced consumer benefits while striving to use less material and increasing the use of more sustainable material. Over the past decade, the company has explored an extensive array of alternative fiber options, investing significantly in developing more sustainable products. Based on progress against existing goals, Kimberly-Clark is setting a new ambition to be 100% Natural Forest Free across its product portfolio. The company expects to be more than halfway to this goal by 2030.\n\nLong-Term Growth and Return Algorithm\n\nKimberly-Clark has set long-term growth and return targets that include:\n\n\"We see a clear path to consistent growth and strong margin expansion as we sharpen our focus on areas of competitive advantage and where we believe we have the right to win,\" said Nelson Urdaneta, Chief Financial Officer. \"Leveraging our strong innovation pipeline and go-to-market capabilities to drive growth, our new productivity programs to deliver efficiencies, and our capital priorities to support reinvestment and accelerate our strategic plan will support our ability to achieve our new long-term financial profile in the years ahead.\"\n\nThe company's capital priorities have not changed. These priorities include investing to accelerate organic growth with strong returns that will strengthen the company's market positions; growing the dividend while maintaining the company's single-A credit rating; evaluating strategic acquisitions that can deliver incremental growth and return opportunities; and allocating residual capital to share repurchases, to minimally offset dilution from equity incentive programs.\n\nThe company currently expects to incur approximately $1.5 billion in one-time restructuring and reorganization costs, split roughly into 50% in non-cash charges and 50% of cash expenses, over the next three years as it implements its plans.\n\n2024 Outlook\n\nThe company noted that the outlook it provided in January is consistent with its new long-term growth and return targets. The company continues to expect to deliver a low-to-mid single-digit percentage increase in 2024 Organic Net Sales versus the prior year period, with growth in reported Net Sales forecast to reflect negative impacts of approximately 300 basis points from currency translation and 60 basis points from the Brazil Tissue divestiture. Adjusted Operating Profit is still expected to grow at a high single-digit to low double-digit rate on a constant-currency basis and Adjusted Earnings Per share are expected to grow at a high single-digit rate on a constant-currency basis versus the prior year period. Reported growth in Operating Profit and Earnings Per Share are still expected to be negatively impacted by approximately 400 basis points from currency translation.\n\nThis outlook reflects assumptions subject to change given the macro environment.\n\n2024 Investor Day Presentation\n\nThe company is hosting its Investor Day in New York City today beginning at 9 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. The event will also be webcast and accessible from the Events & Presentations section of www.kimberly-clark.com. A replay of the webcast and slides shown during the presentations will be available following the event through the same website.\n\nAbout Kimberly-Clark\n\nKimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB) and its trusted brands are an indispensable part of life for people in more than 175 countries.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and exited businesses also impact the year-over-year change in net sales.\n\nView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kimberly-clark-unveils-next-chapter-of-strategic-transformation-to-unlock-highest-value-growth-opportunities-302100404.html",

        "title": "How the Tucson J is Strengthening the Future of Jewish Communal Life through Teen Engagement, AZ Jewish Post",
        "text": "The BBYO International Convention's Centennial Celebration held last month at the Rosen Shingle Creek Golf Resort in Orlando, Florida, epitomized the vibrancy and spirit of Jewish youth. Ten teens from the Kadimah BBG and Abba Gadol AZA BBYO Chapters housed here at the Tucson J proudly joined nearly 4,000 Jewish peers from across the globe to commemorate 100 years of BBYO's influence, partake in elections, celebrate milestones, and stand united in celebration of Jewish identity.\n\nThe convention was an inspiring microcosm of Jewish teen life and a beacon of teen leadership and Jewish communal pride -- a powerful moment during an era where many adults are grappling with what can at times seem like a fractured and less-engaged population of young Jewish people.\n\nWith speaker panels led by BBYO teen leaders showcasing the organization's commitment to teen-driven leadership, a diverse array of experiences from intense sports tournaments to reflective visits to the Holocaust Museum, opportunities for attendees to venture into the wonders of Cape Canaveral together, and a Havdalah service where 4,000 voices joined in prayer, the conference catered to a wide spectrum of interests and fostered a deep sense of communal pride.\n\nOne of the highlights was the palpable joy of connection, both with old friends and new. Teens expressed their excitement at reuniting with friends from Camp Perlman and other BBYO summer programs, highlighting the deep bonds formed through these shared experiences. \"Seeing friends from Camp Perlman here makes everything feel full circle,\" one attendee remarked. \"It's like we've brought a piece of summer with us, strengthening our connections and creating new memories together.\"\n\n\"The block party, the Havdalah service, the moments of joy, and reflection -- everything was amplified by being here with friends from different chapters and camps,\" another attendee noted. \"It's a powerful reminder of how interconnected we are and how BBYO brings us together, creating a global family,\" remarked another attendee.\n\nAt home at the Tucson J, we are fostering the same kind of excitement and pride in Jewish identity through intentional programming that engages teens in deeper ways, connecting them not only to one another, but global Jewish peoplehood. In addition to weekly BBYO chapter meetings that occur on Monday evenings at the J, bringing around 20 teens together to socialize, bolster leadership skills, and get inspired to live proud, Jewish lives, Jewish teens in Tucson are getting involved in other ways!\n\nEarlier in March, 13 teens concluded the five-week One2One: Teen Encounters program put on by ENTER, and in collaboration with the Weintraub Israel Center. The program served as a cross-cultural exchange, allowing American and Israeli high school students to connect for a series of curated, one-on-one video encounters designed to share experiences, offer mutual support in the aftermath of October 7, and learn about different parts of the Jewish world. The Israeli teens earned English language credits, while American teens were able to put their time toward community service hours -- but the impact was far greater than any school credit earned: the teens ended the program with new perspectives, incredible friendships, and a heightened sense of the shared history and culture that unites the Jewish people.\n\nSince the fall of 2022, BBYO teens have been meeting almost monthly with residents from Handmaker Jewish Services for the Aging for intergenerational programming made possible with grant funding through Better Together. Activities are often centered around holidays and are designed to foster relationships and share stories through the lens of Jewish identity. Two more meetings will take place before the teens break for summer.\n\nWith planning for the 2025 JCC Maccabi Games\u00ae hosted by the Tucson J in full swing, the J looks forward to sharing the passion of our Tucson teens with thousands of other teen athletes from around the country and across the globe. This year, the J is sending a delegation to the Detroit Games July 28-August 2 and bringing teen athletes with developmental and physical disabilities to Houston August 4-9 for the JCC Maccabi Access Games.\n\nThere is so much on the horizon for Jewish teens here in Tucson, and the future for all of us looks brighter if we continue to provide and support teens in having meaningful Jewish journeys. If you know a teen who would like to get involved with BBYO or Maccabi, reach out to Davis Hubbell, Director of Teen Engagement, here.",

        "title": "World Happiness Report 2024: India ranks 126th out of 143 nations; old Indian women most satisfied",
        "text": "In a surprising revelation, the report states that older age is associated with higher life satisfaction in India with older women experiencing more life satisfaction than older men\n\nImage for representational purposes only. Photo Courtesy: Freepik\n\nIn the recently released World Happiness Report 2024 on the occasion of International Day of Happiness observed on March 20 every year, Finland topped the list of the happiest countries in the world for the seventh consecutive year.\n\nThe top 10 happiest countries in the world, according to the report are, Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Sweden, Israel, Netherlands, Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Australia.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWorld Happiness Report is a global happiness index that releases in-depth data on factors that contribute to human well-being, the happiness ratings of countries and the significance of measuring happiness.\n\nThis year, India ranked 126th out of 143 nations retaining its rank from 2023. It must be noted that in 2023 India ranked 126th position out of 136 countries, making it one of the least happy countries in the world. In 2022, India ranked 136th position out of 146 countries.\n\nAccording to the report that was collated by a partnership of Gallup, the Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, and the WHR's Editorial Board, India is behind Pakistan, Libya, Iraq, and Palestine.\n\nIn a surprising revelation, the report states that older age is associated with higher life satisfaction in India. It mentions, \"On average, older men in India are more satisfied with life than older women but when taking all other measures into account, older women report higher life satisfaction than their male counterparts.\"\n\nIndia's older population is the second largest worldwide, with 140 million Indians aged 60 and over, second only to its 250 million Chinese counterparts.\n\nAs per the report, it was found that older adults in India with secondary or higher education and those of higher social castes experienced higher life satisfaction than counterparts without formal education and those belonging to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes.\n\nThis life satisfaction is determined by three major predictors: living arrangements, perceived discrimination, and self-rated health.\n\nThe report also mentions that empirical research on gender and life satisfaction in later life has yielded mixed findings. Some studies have found older women report higher life satisfaction than older men, others have found older women to report lower life satisfaction than their male peers, and yet others observed no significant gender difference in life satisfaction. In the present study, older women in India have higher levels of life satisfaction than older men.\n\nThis is somewhat surprising given that women are exposed to more everyday life stressors (e.g., workplace discrimination; secondary social status within families and society at large) and are considered to be more susceptible to them.\n\nLikewise, research has reported on the role of education, marital status, religion, depression, and physical activity and exercise play in gender differentials in life satisfaction.\n\nAlso Read: International Day of Happiness: Yoga practices to cultivate joy\n\nOne factor that may contribute to older women's greater life satisfaction relative to older men is social resources, namely social support. Women, in general, possess wider and more diverse social networks, including a greater number of friends and confidants which likely translates into not only more social support but diverse forms of it.\n\nMen, alternatively, report fewer intimate social relationships and mostly rely on their spouses for support with far fewer people they deem to be their confidants. Older women in India, especially of older cohorts, also may have invested more in building and maintaining family ties (e.g., organising gatherings, writing holiday and birthday cards, and doing physical and emotional care work) while older Indian men may have shouldered the responsibility of building family finances.\n\nGendered division of labour of this nature may explain differences in support later in life, which may reflect gender differences in life satisfaction with older women reporting to be more satisfied with life than their older male peers.\n\nIn the global ranking of happiness in the old (aged 60 and above), India ranks 121st out of 143 nations. Likewise, in the global ranking of happiness in the young (aged below 30), India ranks 127th out of 143 nations. This clearly indicates that the senior citizens of the country and happier and experience life satisfaction more than the country's youth as of 2024.",

In the coming month, 50 systems will be installed on Bon Tour's various buses and minibuses, and following that, a further 250 systems are expected to be installed. Among Bon Tour's customers are government offices, municipalities and councils, institutions and hospitals, factories, tourism bodies, as well as private customers. In February 2024, SaverOne announced that Egged Tours would install 300 SaverOne Systems on all its buses. Egged Tours operates the largest tour bus fleet in Israel. It is a subsidiary of Egged Transportation, Israel's largest bus company, with over 3,000 buses operating nationally with a vast network of urban and intercity routes. In February 2024, SaverOne was granted a new US patent covers aspects of SaverOne's System to prevent distraction while driving. With this new patent, SaverOne's patent portfolio comprises of 23 patents of which 10 are already granted in various jurisdictions and a further 13 additional patent applications in process. These patents are strategically filed in key markets such as the US, China, Israel, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, reflecting the company's strategic vision for global expansion. In February 2024, SaverOne announced that it has launched a new pilot project in the United States with Motor Supply, Inc., a trucking company based in Columbia, South Carolina. The pilot is expected to run over a period of 12 months and, if successful, potentially expand to the rest of the fleet and any future trucks that Motor Supply may operate. In March 2024, GB Tours decided to expand its installation of the SaverOne system across its full fleet of public transportation and tour buses. GB Tours is a leading Israel-based public transportation company that operates public transportation lines as well as tour buses with a fleet of about one hundred buses. This order follows the conclusion of a successful pilot of the SaverOne System on twenty of GB Tours' buses. In March 2024, SaverOne entered into an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) agreement with Volvo Bus Corporation, a subsidiary of the global automotive giant, Volvo Group. Under the OEM agreement, SaverOne's Safety Solution will be installed in new Volvo buses that are manufactured for the Mexican market. Volvo Bus customers in Mexico will be offered the SaverOne Safety Solution pre-installed, following integration into Volvo's assembly line. In addition, the agreement also allows for a retrofit of existing buses covered under Volvo's maintenance agreement (representing approximately 3,000 buses in the market), which will install SaverOne's Safety Solution as an aftermarket installation.\n\nFinancial Summary for 2023\n\nRevenues increased by 128% to NIS 2.720 million (~$0.75 million) in 2023 compared to NIS 1.193 million (~$0.329 million) for 2022. This increase was mainly the result of increased sales of the SaverOne System in Israel with new and existing customers as well as new sales with customers in international regions.\n\nOf the revenues in 2023, 93% of revenues were from Israel while 7% of revenues were from Europe. In 2022, 100% of revenues were from Israel.\n\nGross profit increased by 107% to NIS 0.752 million (~$0.207 million), representing gross margin of 27.6% in 2023 compared to NIS 364 thousand (~$0.1 million), representing gross margin of 30.5%, in 2022.\n\nResearch and development expenses, net were NIS 22.9 million (~$6.3 million) in 2023 compared to NIS 21.5 million (~$5.9 million) in 2022.\n\nSelling and marketing expenses were NIS 3.8 million (~$1.0 million) in 2023 compared to NIS 1.6 million (~$0.439 million) in 2022. The increase is attributable mainly to higher payroll and investor relations expenses, as part of the Company's efforts to increase sales and marketing efforts.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses were NIS 8.3 million (~$2.3 million) in 2023, compared to NIS 6.5 million (~$1.8 million) in 2022. The increase in these expenses was mainly due to additional costs associated with being a US listed public company.\n\nOperating loss was NIS 34.2 million (~$9.4 million) in 2023 compared to NIS 29.2 million (~$8.1 million) in 2022, primarily due to increased operating expenses as detailed above.\n\nFinancing income, net, was NIS 0.388 million (~$0.107 million) for 2023 compared to financing income, net, of NIS 4.2 million (~$1.2 million) in 2022.

SaverOne will deliver a hard copy of its annual report, including its complete audited consolidated financial statements, free of charge, to its shareholders upon request at saverone@ekgir.com.\n\nAbout the SaverOne System\n\nSaverOne's system is installed in vehicles to provide a solution to the problem of driver distraction, as a result of drivers using distracting applications on the mobile phone while driving, in a way that endangers their safety and the safety of their passengers. This phenomenon is considered one of the main causes of road accidents in the world. According to the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the annual cost of road accidents just in the United States, stands at about $870 billion each year, excluding the costs of serious injury or death, with a quarter of those accidents estimated to be related to the use of the mobile phones while driving. SaverOne's technology specifically recognizes the driver area in the vehicle and prevents the driver from accessing distracting applications such as messaging, while allowing others (e.g. navigation, calls), without user intervention or consent, creating a safer driving environment.\n\nSaverOne's primary target markets include commercial and private vehicle fleets, including public transportation and buses, that are interested in reducing potential damages and significant cost, vehicle manufacturers that are interested in integrating safety solutions to their vehicles, and insurance and leasing companies. SaverOne initially addresses car fleets with focus on the Israeli, European and US markets, as well as other markets around the world. SaverOne believes that ultimately increased focus on monitoring and prevention of cellular distraction systems in vehicles, in particular driven by upcoming expected EU regulation, will likely have a dramatic positive impact on the demand for its systems in the future.\n\nThe Company's strategy is to provide its technology for installation to customers in the aftermarket as well as address OEM vehicle manufacturers, to install the Company's protection technologies during the vehicle manufacturing process.\n\nAbout SaverOne\n\nSaverOne is a technology company engaged in the design, development and commercialization of OEM and aftermarket solutions and technologies, to lower the risk of, and prevent, vehicle accidents.\n\nSaverOne's initial line of products is a suite of solutions that saves lives by preventing car accidents resulting from distraction from the use of mobile phones while driving. SaverOne is also developing a sensor system for early location and direction detection under all visibility conditions of vulnerable road users (VRU) through their cellphone footprint.\n\nTo learn more about the company, please visit: https://saver.one/\n\nFor the corporate video, please visit: https://saver.one/media/\n\nForward Looking Statements\n\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act and other securities laws that are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.

the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the repurchase agreements by the Holders; our reliance on a small number of significant customers; continued vertical integration by our customers; global shifts in sourcing customer requirements; shifts in the global supply and demand position for tobacco products; variation in our financial results due to growing conditions, customer indications and other factors;

our ability to continue to access capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing; potential failure of foreign banks in which our subsidiaries maintain deposits or the failure by such banks to transfer funds or honor withdrawals;

The Indian festival of Holi, also known as the 'festival of colours' and the Jewish festival of Purim, when people wear colourful dresses, share many commonalities.\n\n''Both festivals are celebrated to mark the victory of good over evil. Both festivals are celebrated around the same time- the arrival of spring and the end of winter. Both festivals are celebrated outdoors where communities come together, dance, sing, eat and make fun in a spirit of togetherness'', a participant noted.\n\nThe Flea market in Yafo wore a festive look dressed up in an Indian ensemble in various ways.\n\nThe event was attended by Deputy Chief of Mission, Rajiv Bodwade, and Rafi Shushan, CEO of \"Mishlama leyafo\" from the Tel Aviv Yafo Municipality.\n\n''In association with #TelAvivYafo Municipality, the Embassy of India celebrated the 'India in Flea Market' event on the occasion of #Holi and #Purim festivals. Over 2000 visitors enjoyed Indian dance, classical music, Indian dresses, henna, calligraphy in Hindi & Indian Chai'', a post by the Indian mission on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, said.\n\nIndian enthusiasts enjoyed activities such as dance workshops with songs about the festival of Holi, presentations narrating the significance of Holi and celebrating the common spirit of happiness and unity that Purim and Holi share.\n\nThere was also a classical Indian instrumental music performance, 'Trikundram', by three Israeli artists who played Bansuri, Tabla and Sitar, and an Indian classical dance performance by Israeli artists.\n\nHenna stalls attracted a lot of women visitors who enjoyed Mehndi drawing on their palms. Calligraphy stalls writing names of visitors in Hindi also was a hit among youngsters.\n\nA dress corner was also set up showcasing Indian costumes to the visitors.\n\nThe visitors dressed up in Indian costumes and enjoyed taking photographs at the selfie points and drank Indian Chai giving the event a sense of Purim celebrations.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "title": "Faith traditions coincide with joy and beauty of springtime | Candace McKibben",
        "text": "I recall once during a season of depression, my beloved physician assuring me that the increased light in springtime would be a helpful antidote.\n\nHe was right. It is my prayer for all of us who may be feeling overwhelmed by the heartache in the world and in our lives, that this glorious season of lengthening days and incredible beauty, this season when, as the ancient hymn describes, \"earth her joy confesses clothing her for spring,\" will lighten the mood in downcast spirits.\n\nThis coming week, several religions have festivals or holy days that add to the joy and beauty of the spring season.\n\nJewish holiday of Purim\n\nThe Jewish community will be celebrating Purim, known as the most fun-filled holiday of the Jewish year.\n\nHonored this year on the evening of March 23 and continuing March 24, the festival celebrates the salvation of the Jews from Haman's plot to annihilate all the Jews in Ancient Persia more than 2,000 years ago as told in the book of Esther. It also affirms the courage of Queen Esther and all Jews since to claim their Jewishness.\n\nThere are four elements to the festival, including reading the entire book of Esther twice, sending a substantial gift of food to a friend, giving at least two needy people a gift of food or cash, and a joyful, lavish communal meal. Involving noise makers, costumes, indulgent food, drink, and laughter, Temple Israel (among other Jewish groups in Tallahassee) offers a variety of ways to celebrate at temple-israel.org.\n\nHoly Week and Palm Sunday\n\nIn Christian congregations, the joyous and peaceful entry of Jesus into Jerusalem will be the theme on March 24 for Palm Sunday. Recorded in all four gospel narratives, the crowds welcomed Jesus with the waving of palm branches, creating a pathway with their garments, shouting hosannas.\n\nIn churches all over the world as well as here in Tallahassee, children and adults will reenact this moment of joy that begins the last week of Jesus' life, a week referred to as Holy Week, leading to Easter Sunday. Trinity United Methodist Church is but one of many churches in our community that will be celebrating Palm Sunday with a palm processional on March 24. See trinitymp.org for their Holy Week schedule.\n\nHindu festival of Holi\n\nHoli, an ancient Hindu festival dating to 4CE, celebrated first in India and now in places around the world, is being officially held on March 25 this year. Also known as the festival of colors, love, and spring, it involves in part throwing colored water and colored powder at each other in playful banter.\n\nOnce made exclusively of flowers, the colored powders are stunningly beautiful. Based on several ancient Hindu legends, Holi encourages staying positive, goodness over evil, and a moment of reprieve from the societal norms that divide us. In our community, Holi is being celebrated on March 23 from 11 a.m.-3 p.m. on Langford Green.\n\nAlso, the India Association of Tallahassee will be hosting a Holi Celebration at AJ Henry Park on Saturday, March 30, 2024, from 11 a.m.- 2 a.m. for its members. Holi has become increasingly popular outside of India in large part because of the millions of Indians and other South Asians living all over the world.\n\nRamadan\n\nBeyond these three imminent religious celebrations there, are other religious springtime observances. Set by the lunar calendar, as are all these spring celebrations, the Islamic observance of Ramadan has been ongoing this year since the evening of March 10, and will continue until April 9 for our Muslim neighbors. Ramadan commemorates the month during which Muslims believe the prophet Muhammed received the first revelations of the Quran, their holy scripture.\n\nWhile they do not eat or drink during daylight hours during this holy month, Muslims find the fasting, introspection, practice of gratitude, scripture reading, prayer and giving to charity to be both meaningful and joyful. The evening breaking of the fast after sunset (iftar) is often enjoyed in community, and the final breaking of the fast on \"Eid Al Fitr\" is particularly joyous. The Islamic Center of Tallahassee has more information.\n\nPassover\n\nPassover, an eight-day festival celebrating the Jewish liberation from slavery in Egypt, is one of the most important Jewish holidays of the year, falling on April 22-30, 2024. The \"Haggadah,\" the core text of the Passover seder, is being reimagined this year by many congregations considering the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.\n\nIn addition to the seminal \"Four Questions\" recited during the seder, which ask, \"Why is this night different from all other nights?\" some rabbis, scholars, and leaders suggest additional text this year to reflect the feelings of seder attendees.\n\nAccording to an article in \"The Jewish Telegraphic Agency,\" a potential change might be to include, \"On all other nights, we think that we have answers. Tonight, we all just stay silent,\" says the passage, which is in Hebrew. \"On all other nights, we remember, sing and cry. ... On this night, we only cry.\"\n\nReligion and sacred rituals\n\nA new PEW research center survey released on March 14 (polling 12,693 U.S. adults from Feb. 13-25, 2024) indicates that 8 of 10 Americans say religion is losing influence in public life, and 49% say both that religion is losing influence and that this is bad. While there is certainly legitimate cause for concern and correction in many religions and religious institutions, I am grateful that we still have people who find value in religions and the sacred rituals they offer.\n\nRobin Dunbar, emeritus professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of Oxford and author of \"How Religion Evolved and Why It Endures,\" says religious people are more likely to feel that they belong to a community, and the practice of religious rituals triggers physiological responses that help seal that sense of connectedness.\n\nShe also says that the cognitive abilities that allow for religious discussion involving understanding what another is thinking, imagining beyond what is, and acknowledging parallel worlds, is what gives us science and literature in addition to religion, enriching civilization.\n\nI am deeply appreciative of the remarkable power of nature and its beauty to lift the human spirit as my doctor prescribed long ago. I am also grateful for the many ways spring has inspired rich and supportive rituals in many of the religions of the world. With so much chaos and sorrow in the world, I am encouraged to know that religion, while not for everyone, is still a source of strength for many, some in the most desperate situations, in finding hope.",

The World Happiness Report 2024 places it in 23rd place, while in last year's edition it was 15th.\n\nThe report partly attributes the decline in the US' positions, like that of Germany (24th place), to the trend towards an increase in the perception of happiness among Eastern European countries. Spain, which in 2021 was in 24th place, in 2022 in 29th and in 2023 in 32nd, moves to 36th in 2024.\n\nThe report highlights that, in contrast, there are countries that show significant increases in evaluations and highlights the case of Serbia, in 37th place, and Bulgaria, in 81st, which have climbed, respectively, 69 and 63 positions since the edition. of 2013.\n\n\"The ten countries at the top of the list remain practically the same since before the covid pandemic,\" the report highlights.\n\nFinland, which has been in the number one spot for seven years, is closely followed by Denmark and then Iceland, Sweden, Israel, the Netherlands, Norway, Luxembourg, Switzerland and Australia.\n\nThe latter are Afghanistan (143), Lebanon (142), Lesotho (141), Sierra Leone (140), Democratic Republic of Congo (139), Zimbabwe (138), Botswana (137), Malawi (136), and Esuatin (135). ) and Zambia (134).\n\nAmong the Latin American countries studied, Mexico (25th place) is the best placed, followed by Uruguay (26th), El Salvador (33rd), Chile (38th), Panama (39th), Guatemala (42nd), Nicaragua (43rd), Brazil (44), Argentina (48), Paraguay (57), Honduras (61), Peru (68), Dominican Republic (69), Bolivia (73), Ecuador (74), Colombia (78) and Venezuela (79).\n\nRussia and Ukraine, facing each other since 2022 in a war with no signs of a solution for now, are in 72nd and 105th place, respectively.\n\nFrom the comparison between generations made this year, it is deduced that, on average, people born before 1965 - 'boomers' and their predecessors - are happier than those born after 1980 - 'millennials' and generation Z-.\n\nSpeaking specifically of countries, the one with the most satisfied children and young people under 30 years of age is Lithuania and, for those over 60 years of age, Denmark is the happiest country in the world.",

        "text": "LEGEND achieved its primary efficacy endpoint by significantly lowering HbA1c level in both the lanifibranor arm and in the lanifibranor with empagliflozin arm compared to placebo.Statistical significance was also achieved on several markers of liver injury, markers of glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as hepatic steatosis.Patients treated with lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin maintained a stable weight throughout the 24 weeks study, addressing the moderate, metabolically healthy, weight gain that has been observed in some patients treated with lanifibranor.Treatment with lanifibranor alone and in combination with empagliflozin decreased the ratio of visceral abdominal fat to subcutaneous fat, reflecting a shift from pro-inflammatory visceral fat towards metabolically healthy adipose tissue.The treatment with lanifibranor 800mg/once daily alone or in combination with empagliflozin for 24 weeks was well tolerated, with no safety concerns reported.Inventiva will host an investor webcast Tuesday, March 19th at 8am ET (details below).\n\nDaix (France), Long Island City (New York, United States), March 18, 2024 - Inventiva (Euronext Paris and Nasdaq: IVA), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), also known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs, today announces positive results of its interim analysis of the Phase II, Proof-of-Concept clinical trial, LEGEND, evaluating lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with MASH/NASH and poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).\n\nThe LEGEND trial has been designed as a multi-center, randomized, 24-week treatment, placebo-controlled Phase\n\nII Proof-of-Concept trial to assess the safety and efficacy of lanifibranor in combination with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin for the treatment of patients with non-cirrhotic MASH/NASH and T2D. The trial is double-blind for the placebo arm and lanifibranor (800mg daily) arm, and open-label for the combination of lanifibranor (800mg daily) and empagliflozin (10 mg daily) arm. The diagnosis of non-cirrhotic MASH/NASH was based on historic histology evaluation or a combination of non-invasive methods including diagnostic methods including imaging. As planned per protocol, the interim analysis was done once half of the 63 planned randomized patients with MASH completed the 24-week treatment period or prematurely discontinued from treatment.\n\nThe study achieved the primary efficacy endpoint with an absolute reduction in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 1.14% and 1.59% in patients with MASH and T2D treated with lanifibranor (800mg daily) or in combination with empagliflozin (10mg daily) at week 24 compared to an increase of 0.26% observed in the placebo arm.\n\nThe study also demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in hepatic steatosis measured by MRI-PDFF1, in patients treated with lanifibranor alone and in combination with empagliflozin, -47% and -38% respectively, compared to placebo (0%). 83% and 67% of patients treated with lanifibranor alone or in combination with empagliflozin respectively, showed a reduction greater or equal to 30% of their hepatic fat, compared to 0% in the placebo arm. In addition, the study demonstrated a statistically significant effect on several secondary and exploratory endpoints, including liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (\"ALT\") and aspartate aminotransferase (\"AST\")), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), HDL, and adiponectin (see tables below). Markers of liver inflammation and fibrosis (corrected T1 relaxation time (cT1) assessed by LiverMultiScan\u00ae) were assessed for the first time with lanifibranor and showed a significant effect with lanifibranor alone and in combination with empagliflozin.\n\nThe study also demonstrated that patients treated with lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin maintained a stable weight throughout the 24 weeks study, addressing the moderate, metabolically healthy, weight gain that can be observed in some patients treated with lanifibranor alone. Furthermore, these results demonstrated a significant relative reduction in the VAT/SAT ratio (visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue) in patients treated with lanifibranor alone or in combination with empagliflozin, -5% and -17% respectively, compared to an increase of 11% in patients under placebo. This result reflects a shift from pro-inflammatory visceral fat towards metabolically healthy adipose tissue.\n\nThe treatment with lanifibranor 800mg/daily alone and in combination with empagliflozin 10mg/daily for 24 weeks appears to be well tolerated, with no safety concerns reported.\n\nDr. Michael Cooreman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Inventiva: \"The results of the LEGEND study announced today further illustrate the potential of lanifibranor to address the broad spectrum of the disease biology of MASH and T2D. These data complement the already published dataset of lanifibranor demonstrating fibrosis improvement and MASH resolution but also its role as a potent insulin sensitizer. With roughly 50% of the U.S. population estimated to have either prediabetes or diabetes, and the well-established correlation between MASH and T2D, lanifibranor has a unique mechanism of action to potentially address the medical need of patients with both MASH and T2D. We wish to thank the patients who participated in the study and the investigators of LEGEND.\"\n\nDr. Onno Holleboom, MD PhD, endocrinologist and associate professor at Amsterdam UMC, co-principal investigator of the LEGEND Phase II clinical trial: \"It is a big step seeing these positive results of LEGEND demonstrating the impact of lanifibranor on steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis while stabilizing weight with empagliflozin in patients with poorly controlled T2D and MASH. The study was designed as a proof of concept and these results are significant and strengthen confidence in the potential of lanifibranor to address the specific metabolic unbalance in patients with T2D while also addressing steatosis and fibrosis, a hepatic consequence of insulin resistance.\"\n\nProf. Michelle Lai, M.D., Ph.D., Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and co-principal investigator of the LEGEND Phase II clinical trial, said: \"These LEGEND results provide valuable insights on the complementary mechanisms of action of an SGLT2 inhibitor and the panPPAR agonist, lanifibranor. MASH is a multifaceted disease that we believe will benefit from combination therapies in order to properly address the full cardiometabolic spectrum of the disease. These results of LEGEND suggest that lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin could be an ideal combination for patients we care for in our clinic who suffer from T2D and MASH.\"\n\nGiven that the primary endpoint of LEGEND was met, and statistically significant results were achieved on several key additional markers, the Company has decided to stop the recruitment as defined per protocol. More details on these results are expected to be presented in upcoming scientific conferences and submitted for publication.\n\nInventiva will host a conference call and webcast with slide presentation on Tuesday, March 19, 2024 at 8:00 am ET (New York time) 1:00 pm CET (Paris time).\n\nIntroduced by Frederic Cren, Chairman, CEO and cofounder of Inventiva, this event will be as follow:\n\nPresentation of LEGEND Results - Michael Cooreman, M.D., CMO of Inventiva Metabolic and hepatic benefits of lanifibranor - Stephen Harrison, M.D., Pinnacle Clinical Research and principal investigator of the exploratory cohort of NATiV3, Phase III clinical trial Vascular benefits of lanifibranor - Sven Francque, M.D., University Hospital Antwerp, co-principal investigator of NATiV3, Phase III clinical trialOpportunity for lanifibranor - Frederic Cren, CEO and cofounder of Inventiva\n\nThe conference call and the slides of the presentation will be webcast live at: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/hyuvxf9a and will also be available on Inventiva's website: Investor Presentations - Inventiva Pharma.

Participants will need to use the conference access information provided in the e-mail received at the point of registering (dial-in number and access code).\n\nAbout lanifibranor\n\nLanifibranor, Inventiva's lead product candidate, is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) isoforms, which are well characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner, with a \u2011wellbalanced\u2011 activation of PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b4, and a partial activation of PPAR\u03b3. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation, lanifibranor is the only panPPAR\u2011 agonist in clinical development for the treatment of MASH/NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor's moderate and balanced panPPAR\u2011 binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and preclinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor\u2011 for the treatment of MASH/NASH.\n\nAbout Inventiva\n\nInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with MASH/NASH, and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors, transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva is currently advancing one clinical candidate, has a pipeline of two preclinical programs and continues to explore other development opportunities to add to its pipeline.\n\nInventiva's lead product candidate, lanifibranor, is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial, NATiV3, for the treatment of adult patients with MASH/NASH, a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.\n\nInventiva's pipeline also includes odiparcil, a drug candidate for the treatment of adult MPS VI patients. As part of Inventiva's decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor, it suspended its clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is also in the process of selecting a candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.\n\nThe Company has a scientific team of approximately 90 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology, medicinal and computational chemistry, pharmacokinetics and pharmacology, and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240,000 pharmacologically relevant molecules, approximately 60% of which are proprietary, as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.\n\nInventiva is a public company listed on compartment B of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA, ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.com\n\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner, with a -wellbalanced- activation of PPARa and PPARd, and a partial activation of PPAR?. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation, lanifibranor is the only panPPAR- agonist in clinical development for the treatment of MASH/NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor's moderate and balanced panPPAR- binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and preclinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor- for the treatment of MASH/NASH.\n\nAbout Inventiva\n\nInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with MASH/NASH, and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors, transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva is currently advancing one clinical candidate, has a pipeline of two preclinical programs and continues to explore other development opportunities to add to its pipeline.\n\nInventiva's lead product candidate, lanifibranor, is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial, NATiV3, for the treatment of adult patients with MASH/NASH, a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.\n\nInventiva's pipeline also includes odiparcil, a drug candidate for the treatment of adult MPS VI patients. As part of Inventiva's decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor, it suspended its clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is also in the process of selecting a candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.\n\nThe Company has a scientific team of approximately 90 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology, medicinal and computational chemistry, pharmacokinetics and pharmacology, and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240,000 pharmacologically relevant molecules, approximately 60% of which are proprietary, as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.\n\nInventiva is a public company listed on compartment B of the regulated market of Euronext Paris\n\nContacts\n\nInventiva\n\nPascaline Clerc\n\nEVP, Strategy and Corporate Affairs\n\nmedia@inventivapharma.com (mailto:media@inventivapharma.com)\n\n+1 202 499 8937Brunswick Group\n\nTristan Roquet Montegon /\n\nAude Lepreux /\n\nJulia Cailleteau\n\nMedia relations\n\ninventiva@brunswickgroup.com (mailto:inventiva@brunswickgroup.com)\n\n+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke, an ICR Company\n\nPatricia L.

        "text": "Loading...Loading...LEGEND achieved its primary efficacy endpoint by significantly lowering HbA1c level in both the lanifibranor arm and in the lanifibranor with empagliflozin arm compared to placebo.Statistical significance was also achieved on several markers of liver injury, markers of glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as hepatic steatosis.Patients treated with lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin maintained a stable weight throughout the 24 weeks study, addressing the moderate, metabolically healthy, weight gain that has been observed in some patients treated with lanifibranor.Treatment with lanifibranor alone and in combination with empagliflozin decreased the ratio of visceral abdominal fat to subcutaneous fat, reflecting a shift from pro-inflammatory visceral fat towards metabolically healthy adipose tissue.The treatment with lanifibranor 800mg/once daily alone or in combination with empagliflozin for 24 weeks was well tolerated, with no safety concerns reported.Inventiva will host an investor webcast Tuesday, March 19th at 8am ET (details below).\n\nDaix (France), Long Island City (New York, United States), March 18, 2024 - Inventiva IVA, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), also known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and other diseases with significant unmet medical needs, today announces positive results of its interim analysis of the Phase II, Proof-of-Concept clinical trial, LEGEND, evaluating lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin in patients with MASH/NASH and poorly controlled Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).\n\nThe LEGEND trial has been designed as a multi-center, randomized, 24-week treatment, placebo-controlled Phase\n\nII Proof-of-Concept trial to assess the safety and efficacy of lanifibranor in combination with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin for the treatment of patients with non-cirrhotic MASH/NASH and T2D. The trial is double-blind for the placebo arm and lanifibranor (800mg daily) arm, and open-label for the combination of lanifibranor (800mg daily) and empagliflozin (10 mg daily) arm. The diagnosis of non-cirrhotic MASH/NASH was based on historic histology evaluation or a combination of non-invasive methods including diagnostic methods including imaging. As planned per protocol, the interim analysis was done once half of the 63 planned randomized patients with MASH completed the 24-week treatment period or prematurely discontinued from treatment.\n\nThe study achieved the primary efficacy endpoint with an absolute reduction in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 1.14% and 1.59% in patients with MASH and T2D treated with lanifibranor (800mg daily) or in combination with empagliflozin (10mg daily) at week 24 compared to an increase of 0.26% observed in the placebo arm.\n\nThe study also demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in hepatic steatosis measured by MRI-PDFF1, in patients treated with lanifibranor alone and in combination with empagliflozin, -47% and -38% respectively, compared to placebo (0%). 83% and 67% of patients treated with lanifibranor alone or in combination with empagliflozin respectively, showed a reduction greater or equal to 30% of their hepatic fat, compared to 0% in the placebo arm. In addition, the study demonstrated a statistically significant effect on several secondary and exploratory endpoints, including liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (\"ALT\") and aspartate aminotransferase (\"AST\")), insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), HDL, and adiponectin (see tables below). Markers of liver inflammation and fibrosis (corrected T1 relaxation time (cT1) assessed by LiverMultiScan\u00ae) were assessed for the first time with lanifibranor and showed a significant effect with lanifibranor alone and in combination with empagliflozin.\n\nThe study also demonstrated that patients treated with lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin maintained a stable weight throughout the 24 weeks study, addressing the moderate, metabolically healthy, weight gain that can be observed in some patients treated with lanifibranor alone. Furthermore, these results demonstrated a significant relative reduction in the VAT/SAT ratio (visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue) in patients treated with lanifibranor alone or in combination with empagliflozin, -5% and -17% respectively, compared to an increase of 11% in patients under placebo. This result reflects a shift from pro-inflammatory visceral fat towards metabolically healthy adipose tissue.\n\nThe treatment with lanifibranor 800mg/daily alone and in combination with empagliflozin 10mg/daily for 24 weeks appears to be well tolerated, with no safety concerns reported.\n\nDr. Michael Cooreman, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Inventiva: \"The results of the LEGEND study announced today further illustrate the potential of lanifibranor to address the broad spectrum of the disease biology of MASH and T2D. These data complement the already published dataset of lanifibranor demonstrating fibrosis improvement and MASH resolution but also its role as a potent insulin sensitizer. With roughly 50% of the U.S. population estimated to have either prediabetes or diabetes, and the well-established correlation between MASH and T2D, lanifibranor has a unique mechanism of action to potentially address the medical need of patients with both MASH and T2D. We wish to thank the patients who participated in the study and the investigators of LEGEND.\"\n\nDr. Onno Holleboom, MD PhD, endocrinologist and associate professor at Amsterdam UMC, co-principal investigator of the LEGEND Phase II clinical trial: \"It is a big step seeing these positive results of LEGEND demonstrating the impact of lanifibranor on steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis while stabilizing weight with empagliflozin in patients with poorly controlled T2D and MASH. The study was designed as a proof of concept and these results are significant and strengthen confidence in the potential of lanifibranor to address the specific metabolic unbalance in patients with T2D while also addressing steatosis and fibrosis, a hepatic consequence of insulin resistance.\"\n\nProf. Michelle Lai, M.D., Ph.D., Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and co-principal investigator of the LEGEND Phase II clinical trial, said: \"These LEGEND results provide valuable insights on the complementary mechanisms of action of an SGLT2 inhibitor and the panPPAR agonist, lanifibranor. MASH is a multifaceted disease that we believe will benefit from combination therapies in order to properly address the full cardiometabolic spectrum of the disease. These results of LEGEND suggest that lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin could be an ideal combination for patients we care for in our clinic who suffer from T2D and MASH.\"\n\nGiven that the primary endpoint of LEGEND was met, and statistically significant results were achieved on several key additional markers, the Company has decided to stop the recruitment as defined per protocol. More details on these results are expected to be presented in upcoming scientific conferences and submitted for publication.\n\nConference call\n\nInventiva will host a conference call and webcast with slide presentation on Tuesday, March 19, 2024 at 8:00 am ET (New York time) 1:00 pm CET (Paris time).\n\nIntroduced by Frederic Cren, Chairman, CEO and cofounder of Inventiva, this event will be as follow:\n\nLoading...Loading...Presentation of LEGEND Results - Michael Cooreman, M.D., CMO of Inventiva Metabolic and hepatic benefits of lanifibranor - Stephen Harrison, M.D., Pinnacle Clinical Research and principal investigator of the exploratory cohort of NATiV3, Phase III clinical trial Vascular benefits of lanifibranor - Sven Francque, M.D., University Hospital Antwerp, co-principal investigator of NATiV3, Phase III clinical trialOpportunity for lanifibranor - Frederic Cren, CEO and cofounder of Inventiva\n\nThe conference call and the slides of the presentation will be webcast live at: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/hyuvxf9a and will also be available on Inventiva's website: Investor Presentations - Inventiva Pharma.

Future results may turn out to be materially different from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements, forecasts and estimates, due to a number of factors, including that Inventiva cannot provide assurance on the impacts of the pause on enrolment or the ultimate impact on the results or timing of the NATiV3 trial or regulatory matters with respect thereto, that Inventiva is a clinical-stage company with no approved products and no historical product revenues, Inventiva has incurred significant losses since inception, Inventiva has a limited operating history and has never generated any revenue from product sales, Inventiva will require additional capital to finance its operations, in the absence of which, Inventiva may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of its research or development programs or be unable to expand its operations or otherwise capitalize on its business opportunities and may be unable to continue as a going concern, Inventiva's future success is dependent on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization of current and any future product candidates, preclinical studies or earlier clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results and the results of Inventiva's and its partners' clinical trials may not support Inventiva's and its partners' product candidate claims, Inventiva's expectations with respect to its clinical trials may prove to be wrong and regulatory authorities may require holds and/or amendments to Inventiva's clinical trials, Inventiva's expectations with respect to the clinical development plan for lanifibranor for the treatment of MASH/NASH may not be realized and may not support the approval of a New Drug Application, Inventiva and its partners may encounter substantial delays beyond expectations in their clinical trials or fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities, the ability of Inventiva and its partners to recruit and retain patients in clinical studies, enrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials is an expensive and time-consuming process and could be made more difficult or rendered impossible by multiple factors outside Inventiva's and its partners' control, Inventiva's product candidates may cause adverse drug reactions or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, or limit their commercial potential, Inventiva faces substantial competition and Inventiva's and its partners' business, and preclinical studies and clinical development programs and timelines, its financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by geopolitical events, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and related sanctions, impacts and potential impacts on the initiation, enrollment and completion of Inventiva's and its partners' clinical trials on anticipated timelines and the state of war between Israel and Hamas and the related risk of a larger conflict, health epidemics, and macroeconomic conditions, including global inflation, rising interest rates, uncertain financial markets and disruptions in banking systems.
