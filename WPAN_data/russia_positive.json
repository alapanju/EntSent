        "text": "I expect many of us who see Trump for what he is -- that is, a self-demonstrated threat to American democracy -- have struggled with that matter and perhaps given up on ever getting through. We are in a period that might well be called The Great Rationalization, a time when many of our fellow citizens have developed tissue-thin justifications for continuing to support a pronounced authoritarian who tried to subvert the last election.\n\nIf you believe in reason and rationality, it is a puzzling and frustrating situation.\n\nBack during the George W. Bush administration, when left-wing types would email to express their worries that Bush wouldn't leave office if he lost in 2004 or perhaps not even at the end of a second term in 2008, I would reply that that was simply silly. Whatever one thought of his politics, George W. believed in our Constitution, our democracy, and our system of government. As the scion of a well-regarded family with a long record of public service, he obviously would have put the country above himself. He would never have attempted an auto-coup.\n\nBut as we saw with Trump's repeated lie about a stolen 2020 presidential election, his scheming to overturn the legitimate results, his summoning his supporters to Washington, and then his sending them to the Capitol with the instruction that \"if you don't fight like hell\" to block the congressional certification of Joe Biden's win, \"you're not going to have a country anymore,\" Trump puts himself above country and Constitution.\n\nYet he retains the backing of many who consider themselves supporters and defenders of the Constitution and of American democracy. In part, that's because they have let themselves be deluded into believing there was a concerted \"Deep State\" effort to undermine Trump. Or that President Biden somehow ordered the four different sets of criminal indictments the former president now faces.\n\nNone of that is true, of course. Special counsel John Durham's long probe of the FBI's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia ended with much more of a whimper than a bang. It certainly didn't expose a determined Deep State attempt to undermine Trump. Had there been such an effort, surely the anti-Trump cabal would have leaked word just before the 2020 election that the FBI was investigating the Trump campaign. In all likelihood, the resulting stories would have sunk Trump's election chances.\n\nSecondly, two sets of the four rounds of criminal charges against Trump were initiated by county-level prosecutors in New York and Georgia. Biden has no power to order them to do anything. Further, the two sets of federal charges were brought by special counsel Jack Smith, whom Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed specifically to distance the investigation from the Department of Justice.\n\nIt seldom matters with Trump supporters, however, when you run through the particulars that should disabuse them of their preconceptions. They quickly retrench behind a different rationalization or conspiracy theory. Sometimes, despite the well-documented fact that the post-World War II economy has fared considerably better under Democratic presidents than Republican ones, it's the hoary canard that Democrats are crypto-Marxists, just waiting to spring communism on the country.\n\nSo, readers, here's my first question: Have you found a way to get through to your Trump-supporting family members, friends, or acquaintances? That is, have you developed arguments that help clear the conspiratorialist fog that keeps them from seeing Trump for what he is? If so, please share how you made that breakthrough.\n\nI have a second query as well. In the 2020 election cycle, I highlighted several promising efforts to recruit new voters and encourage infrequent ones, efforts that Blue State voters could engage to help in swing states.\n\nAre you involved with such an effort with an organization that you consider well-run and effective? If so, please send me an email about that group.\n\nI'm hoping your responses to one or both of these questions will provide civically useful subjects for columns later in this election season.",

        "text": "Last week, Russia vetoed action to renew the panel of experts' mandate to assist the Council's DPRK sanctions committee.\n\nSharp divisions emerged on Thursday as the General Assembly debated Russia's veto on the Security Council which blocked renewal of the sanctions panel that monitors the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) nuclear weapon and missile programmes.\n\nThis is the third time this year that the world body has met to examine veto use among the Security Council's permanent members - China, France, Russia, United Kingdom and United States - including on the situation in Gaza regarding a US veto.\n\nLast week, Russia vetoed action to renew the panel of experts' mandate to assist the Council's DPRK sanctions committee. Current sanctions include an arms embargo and measures to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, ballistic missiles and other mass destruction-related programmes.\n\nAt the outset of Thursday's meeting, Assembly President Dennis Francis told ambassadors that the recurring use of the veto undermines international peace and security.\n\n\"The spectre of nuclear conflict must compel us to move from rhetoric to tangible action,\" he said, recalling his visit in October to the demilitarised zone between the Republic of Korea and DPRK - more commonly known as South and North Korea respectively - underlining that the current situation is tense.\n\nNew draft resolution\n\nRussian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said his delegation had vetoed the draft resolution tabled by the United States for a number of reasons, among them that extending the panel of experts' mandate would not contribute to normalising the situation on the Korean Peninsula.\n\n\"The basic mechanisms of the sanctions are failing,\" he said, noting that all other restrictive measures against States are subject to review, but none of that applies to DPRK. \"The indefinite maintenance of draconian measures is doomed to fail.\"\n\nThe panel had been reduced to kowtowing to Western powers amid aggressive propaganda and sabre rattling, he said, while underlining that the sanctions have had severe humanitarian consequences.\n\nAs such, he said Russia plans to submit shortly a draft resolution to extend the panel's mandate for one year, with a clear determination for the Security Council to update the parameters of the sanctions regime.\n\nDPRK condemns double standards\n\nAmbassador Kim Song of DPRK said nuclear weapons are stockpiled in many countries, including the US, yet Pyongyang is the only one facing sanctions.\n\nInhumane double standards exist in terms of States rights to defend themselves, he said, adding that Council sanctions are the product of the \"heinous policies\" of the US that hinder DPRK's sovereignty, right to development and existence.\n\n\"This meeting today is not a simple gathering to hear and understand the exercise of the veto,\" the ambassador said.\n\n\"Rather, it serves as an important occasion to determined whether we will leave Security Council to be a tool of the United States...or we make the Council to ensure justice and impartiality and perform its function as required by the international community.\"\n\nChina: Sanctions must not be 'carved in stone'\n\nDeputy Permanent Representative Geng Shuang of China said the Korean War has long ended, \"but the cold war mentality is still lingering\".\n\nThere will be no resolution of the current issues if the security concerns of all parties, including DPRK, remain unaddressed, he said, calling on relevant actors to work together to denuclearise the Korean Peninsula and adopt a path to peace.\n\nThe current tensions are stymying those efforts, he said, emphasising that dialogue and a political settlement of the matter is needed and the Council must play an active role.\n\n\"Sanctions should not be carved in stone,\" he said, adding that \"harsh sanctions\" against DPRK have had a negative effect on the humanitarian situation in the country.\n\nRegarding Russia's new proposal, he expressed hope that Council members will work productively to extend the panel of experts' mandate.\n\nRepublic of Korea: Veto will not silence ongoing efforts\n\nThe representative of the Republic of Korea said the veto sends \"a dangerous message\" and could have a cascading effect on other Council sanctions.\n\nThe panel will cease to exist in three weeks, but the sanctions remain in place, he said, encouraging all Member States to abide by these provisions.\n\nIn terms of the humanitarian situation, he said the international community has attempted to send aid, Pyongyang had declined.\n\n\"The veto will not silence the global non-proliferation regime,\" he said, pledging his delegation's efforts towards the proper functioning of the Security Council and its mechanism for the complete and verifiable denuclearisation of DPRK.\n\nUS: 'We need to uphold our obligations'\n\nRobert Wood, Deputy Permanent Representative of the United States, said that as the draft resolution's penholder, his delegation had sought widespread engagement and that China and Russia have had ample opportunities to discuss sanctions reform in the Council.\n\nInstead, Russia gave Council members an ultimatum that sought one of two outcomes: to prevent sanctions against DPRK or to silence the panel's investigations, including into Moscow's procurement of weapons from Pyongyang for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussia's veto undermines the peace and security architecture and deprives action on one of the Council's most pressing issues, that of peace on the Korean Peninsula, Mr. Wood said.\n\n\"Russia's already threatening to terminate more UN sanctions mandates that help the Security Council monitor and take action to deter threats to international peace and security,\" he said. \"This is why it is critical for all of us to raise our voices today in support of the non-proliferation regime, and in opposition to attempts to silence information, we need to uphold our obligations.\"",

        "title": "The Iran-Saudi agreement has survived a year - here's how it can survive another",
        "text": "An agreement between Iran and Saudi Arabia to heal their previously fractious relationship, mediated with Chinese involvement, survived its first year despite a host of misperceptions guiding both sides.\n\nFor the agreement to continue and evolve beyond a tactical detente, the two parties must acknowledge its real limits and potential. Neither side appears ready to let go of its core ideological stance (in the short term, at least) nor does China appear ready to intervene in any major way to safeguard the agreement.\n\nThe success of the bilateral relations hinges then on realising the untapped power at the disposal of Iranian and Saudi authorities. A regional solution anchored on a gradated approach is the safest bet to lasting peace and order. Having successfully fulfilled confidence-building measures during the first year of the agreement, an update is overdue. That would be one marked by clearing misperceptions and advocating specific economic and security projects across the second year of the agreement.\n\nMisperception of the extent of the Chinese role in bringing about the agreement remains widespread insofar as the Kingdom and the Islamic Republic are concerned, though it could be categorised, for brevity, into two types: real and engineered. In terms of the first, there is a persistent view among some Saudi and Iranian circles that China, due to its extensive economic ties, exercises considerable leverage over both parties.\n\nThis leverage (and the asymmetry as well as trust it entails) renders China, this logic goes, as far more capable of acting as a guarantor to a detente than the US (or Russia or the EU). In other words, China's expanding footprint in the Middle East, as the premier trading partner and energy consumer of Saudi Arabia and Iran, endows it with unparalleled capacity to punish violations to the agreement. These are, in our opinion, the delayed reverberations of the much-misunderstood 25-year Sino-Iranian \"strategic treaty\", the content of which has exaggerated China's long-term economic and security commitments towards Iran.\n\nThe engineered misperception can also be sourced back to Riyadh and Tehran. Some policymakers, per our own conversations, are aware of the limits of Chinese willingness to exercise its influence in defence of the agreement. Rather, they see China, in light of intensifying Sino-American rivalry, as a useful means by which to signal their separate messages of displeasure (and solicitations) to the US, while also strengthening ties with China. This may explain why there are conflicting Saudi and Iranian narratives (some at the very highest levels) about who exactly requested China's mediation (and when), all of which ultimately credit the personal role played by President Xi Jinping in bringing the agreement to fruition.\n\nIn opting for a Chinese mediator, Saudi and Iranian actors have presented this agreement as marking a transformative new phase in China's regional and global power. This narrative has naturally found reception among audiences hyper-focused on great power competition. The late Henry Kissinger (much beloved and feted by the Chinese leadership) compared the 2023 detente to Nixon's 1971 visit to Maoist China, arguing that Beijing had changed \"the terms of reference in international diplomacy\".\n\nAcclaimed Chinese experts on the Middle East, such as Niu Xinchun, Li Shaoxian and Ding Long, have celebrated the agreement in similar terms, casting it as indicative of the success of Chinese diplomatic practices when compared to the US. In the meantime, American analysts in Washington and Republican-aligned conservative commentators have decried it as confirming the Biden administration's incompetence in managing the China threat.\n\nThese misperceptions - whether from the vantage point of Riyadh, Tehran or even Washington - miss the fact that China is not a guarantor. Its two decades-long record of mediation efforts in Palestine, Sudan, Libya and Sudan show that its modus operandi does not include pressuring parties to come to an agreement.\n\nInstead, successful outcomes of mediational intervention - and the Saudi-Iranian detente is really the lone example here - are contingent upon prior buy-in from the concerned actors. Five rounds of talks hosted by Iraq and Oman, and region-wide interest in de-escalation since the Abqaiq-Khurais attacks in Saudi Arabia in 2019, have meant that there existed an immensely suitable environment and moment for Chinese \"quasi-mediation\" (as the academics Sun Degang and Yahya Zoubair call it).\n\nThis Chinese soft-handedness to mediation also applies to its ability (and willingness) to enforce the agreement. One line of thought, prevalent in Saudi Arabia, is that if Iran violates the agreement it would damage its relations with China and invite the latter to impose some kind of punishment. But such behaviour would be quite out of sync with Chinese diplomatic approaches. There are many scenarios where Tehran (or Riyadh) could present a credible case, on national security grounds, of breaking the agreement that would be convincing (or understandable) to Beijing.\n\nThe tone of Chinese diplomats when discussing the agreement belies the fact that they do not view their country's role as that of a guarantor. The word \"hope\", for instance, peppers the statements of Wang Di, the Director General of the department of West Asian and North African Affairs at the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Wang Yi, the Foreign Minister himself. They affirm that China would play a \"constructive role\" in advancing and deepening the Saudi-Iranian detente, but the onus for its success is squarely a regional one.\n\nThe second year of the agreement kicks off with a solid foundation. Both parties know each other better, given their impressively continuous and heightened communication and direct meetings across various levels, political and technical, during the past year. Realism is increasingly characterising the calculus of both - even if in varying degrees - when it comes to acknowledging the redlines and differences of the other party. No alliance is expected, or frankly sought, but the ability to manage a turbulent region and extract win-win concessions for both sides is marking the elements of a reconfigured regional approach.\n\nContinued focus on security and a fresh approach to the economy will best serve year-two discussions. The war in Yemen is not over. Supporting the de-internationalisation of Yemen and an intra-Yemeni dialogue that takes into account all grievances and demands is no easy undertaking for all parties involved, including Saudi Arabia and Iran. But it will be necessary, especially given the slow pace of talks this past year and the added complications arising from the current conflict in the Red Sea. The Durra/Arash gas field has been a point of contention between Iran on the one side and Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on the other. Bringing the file into the rubric of the agreement will prove a useful stress test for it.\n\nIntertwined interests are the best guarantor for peace and security. Joint economic projects that demonstrate benefit to both sides will score a point for policymakers and citizens at large who would feel the impact of these changes on the ground. Sanctions on Iran stand in the way of actualising several projects, but there is room in unsanctioned items like select food items, agriculture commodities, medicines and medical supplies, and even the opportunity to press for partial relief that serves the goal of reducing tensions in the Middle East.\n\nThe road to a lasting Saudi-Iranian agreement is fraught with challenges, yet it is a promising undertaking to advance peace and security in a region in dire need for both. Clearing misperceptions, understanding the Chinese role and fronting a regional approach and specific projects this year are necessary steps towards ensuring that the agreement holds.",

A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "title": "Why is Sudan still at war a year on? | Explained",
        "text": "A conflict in Sudan that erupted a year ago has wreaked havoc across swathes of the country, unleashed waves of ethnic violence in Darfur, driven millions into extreme hunger and created the world's largest displacement crisis.\n\nAlso read: The Sudan conflict explained in 8 charts\n\nWhat triggered the violence?\n\nTensions had been building for months before fighting between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) erupted in the capital Khartoum on April 15, 2023.\n\nThe Army and RSF had been in a fragile partnership after toppling a civilian government in an October 2021 coup, a move that derailed a transition from the rule of Islamist autocrat Omar al-Bashir, who was ousted amid a popular uprising in 2019.\n\nThe rivalry between the two sides burst into the open over an internationally backed plan that would have launched a new transition with civilian parties and was due to be sealed just before the war broke out.\n\nBoth the army and the RSF were required to cede power under the plan and two issues proved especially contentious. One was the timetable for the RSF to be integrated into the regular armed forces. A second was the chain of command between the army and RSF leaders and the question of civilian oversight.\n\nThe warring parties have also been in competition over sprawling business interests that reach beyond Sudan's borders.\n\nWho are the main players?\n\nThe protagonists in the power struggle are General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, head of the Army and leader of Sudan's ruling council since 2019, and his former deputy on the Council RSF leader General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, commonly known as Hemedti.\n\nAlso read: Mohamed Hamdan 'Hemedti' Dagolo | A warlord of his own\n\nThe whereabouts of the two men was often unclear in the early stages of the conflict as fighting subsumed Khartoum. Later, Burhan began to make public appearances in Sudan, as the army and allied government ministries established a presence in the Red Sea city of Port Sudan.\n\nBoth Gen. Burhan and Hemedti travelled outside the country to rally support.\n\nHemedti, who grew wealthy through gold mining and other ventures, is the undisputed leader of the RSF. Members of his family and clan play leading roles and the force's support base is the western region of Darfur, where the RSF emerged from militias that fought alongside government forces to crush rebels in a brutal war that escalated after 2003.\n\nHemedti has also courted some civilian politicians who were involved in plans for a democratic transition before the war.\n\nAnalysts say Gen. Burhan's position is less assured at the head of the Army, where Islamist-leaning Bashir loyalists and veterans have gained sway since the 2021 coup. The RSF routinely says it is fighting to rid Sudan of remnants of Bashir's regime, while the Army says it is trying to protect the State against \"criminal\" rebels.\n\nWitnesses say the RSF and its allies have committed extensive abuses including ethnically targeted killings, sexual violence and looting. Residents have accused the army of killing civilians in indiscriminate shelling and air strikes. Both sides have largely denied the accusations against them.\n\nWho's winning?\n\nThough Sudan's army has superior resources, including air power and an estimated 3,00,000 troops, the RSF has grown into a well-equipped force of some 1,00,000 deployed around the country in recent years.\n\nIn the first days of the war, the RSF's more nimble units were embedded in neighbourhoods across the capital. Towards the end of 2023, the RSF made a series of rapid advances to consolidate its grip on Darfur and take over El Gezira state south of Khartoum, a key agricultural area.\n\nMore recently however, the army has regained some footing, making its most significant advances to date in Omdurman, one of the three cities that make up the wider capital.\n\nWhat's at stake?\n\nThe uprising that led to Bashir's overthrow had raised hopes that Sudan and its population of 49 million could emerge from decades of autocracy, internal conflict and economic isolation.\n\nBut a year of warfare has inflicted massive damage on infrastructure, forced more than 8.5 million people from their homes and driven almost 5 million people to near-famine conditions.\n\nHomes, offices, warehouses and banks have been widely looted, hospitals put out of service and trade and farming disrupted. Thousands of civilians have been killed -- death toll estimates are highly uncertain -- and both sides have been accused of committing war crimes.\n\nAid agencies say fighting, looting and bureaucratic hurdles have severely hampered the delivery of relief.\n\nIntensified political and ethnic rivalries within Sudan have led to fears that the country, Africa's third largest by area, could splinter, destabilising a volatile region bordering the Sahel, the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people have fled to Egypt, Chad and South Sudan, with smaller numbers crossing into Ethiopia and the Central African Republic.\n\nBoth sides have been using gold, Sudan's most valuable and widely smuggled resource, to support their war effort.\n\nWhat are regional and global powers doing?\n\nThe conflict has played into competition for influence in Sudan and the surrounding region among regional and global powers including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and Russia.\n\nGulf states have previously pursued investments in sectors, including agriculture and ports. Russia has been seeking to build a naval base on Sudan's Red Sea coast.\n\nThe UAE has provided arms to the RSF, according to reporting by U.N. experts, while sources say Iran has flown in military support for the army.\n\nEgypt, itself ruled by military man President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi who overthrew his Islamist predecessor, has deep ties to Burhan and the army.\n\nWestern powers, including the United States, had swung behind the transition towards democratic elections following Bashir's overthrow. Diplomatic attention on Sudan has been limited by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nWhat are they doing to end the war?\n\nLast year Saudi Arabia and the United States brought delegations from both factions to Jeddah for talks, but the ceasefires agreed there were repeatedly violated and the process faltered.\n\nOther initiatives have been launched by African regional grouping IGAD and by Egypt, leading to concern about overlapping diplomatic efforts and rivalry.\n\nFighting has continued in past weeks despite appeals for a ceasefire from the U.N. Security Council and Secretary General during the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nThe recently appointed U.S. special envoy for Sudan is pushing for a restart of talks this month in Jeddah. Paris is hosting a donors' conference on April 15 to try to mobilise aid funding and secure more access for humanitarian workers.\n\nRead Comments",

General Assembly meeting, Ambassador Hwang Joon-kook railed against the veto last month of a U.N. Security Council (UNSC) resolution meant to extend the panel's mandate. Absent the resolution, the panel is set to close on April 30.\n\n------------\n\nS. Korea, Britain stage joint maritime patrol to enforce N. Korea sanctions\n\nSEOUL -- South Korea and Britain wrapped up a joint maritime patrol in waters near the Korean Peninsula on Thursday to enforce U.N. Security Council (UNSC) sanctions resolutions against North Korea, Seoul's defense ministry said.\n\nThe joint operation, involving a South Korean Navy vessel and patrol aircraft and a British naval ship, began early this month and is said to have monitored the waters for possible illegal North Korean activities, such as ship-to-ship transfers of oil.\n\n------------\n\n(3rd LD) Biden, Kishida stress N.K. denuclearization goal, decry its missile program, Russia ties\n\nWASHINGTON -- U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida reaffirmed their commitment to North Korea's \"complete\" denuclearization and rebuked the regime for its continuing ballistic missile program and military cooperation with Russia, as they held a summit in Washington Wednesday.\n\nThe leaders also redoubled calls for Pyongyang to return to dialogue in a joint statement that unveiled an array of agreements, including on upgrading their countries' command and control structures, creating an air defense architecture among the U.S., Japan and Australia and deepening people-to-people exchanges.\n\n------------\n\n(2nd LD) N. Korean state media not referring to late founder's birthday as Day of Sun\n\nSEOUL -- North Korea has been ramping up a festive mood to celebrate the upcoming 112th birthday of late founder Kim Il-sung, but its state media has been recently referring to it as \"the April holiday\" instead of what's commonly called the Day of Sun.\n\nKim died of heart failure in 1994 at age 82, opening the way for his son, Kim Jong-il, to take over in communism's first hereditary succession of power.\n\n------------\n\n(LEAD) N. Korea does not appear ready to address 'outstanding' issues with Japan: Tokyo envoy\n\nWASHINGTON -- North Korea does not appear to be ready to deal with \"outstanding\" matters with Japan, including the issue of Japanese nationals abducted by Pyongyang decades ago, Tokyo's top envoy to the United States said Monday.\n\nAmbassador Shigeo Yamada made the remarks, referring to recent statements from senior North Korean officials that Pyongyang does not have intentions to talk with Tokyo over the abduction issue despite Japan's diplomatic outreach to secure a meeting between Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.\n\n(END)",

        "text": "Los Angeles: New films from Yorgos Lanthimos, Andrea Arnold and Francis Ford Coppola, as well as a portrait of 1980s Donald Trump, will compete for the Palme d'Or at the 77th Cannes Film Festival next month, organisers announced on Thursday.\n\nThierry Fremaux, Cannes's artistic director who announced the selections in a news conference in Paris with festival president Iris Knobloch, said this year's lineup was plucked from 2,000 submissions.\n\nThough Fremaux noted he went into the process concerned about the effect of last year's strikes on American films, the lineup is typically full of top international filmmakers as well as a few hotly anticipated blockbusters.\n\nAmong the 19 films selected for competition is Lanthimos' \"Kinds of Kindness,\" the Greek director's follow-up to the Oscar-winning \"Poor Things.\" Its cast includes two stars of \"Poor Things\": Emma Stone and Willem Dafoe.\n\nPaolo Sorrentino, the Italian filmmaker of \"The Great Beauty,\" returns to Cannes with \"Parthenhope,\" a Naples-set drama co-starring Gary Oldman. Arnold, the British director of \"American Honey\" and \"Fish Tank,\" also returns to Cannes with \"Bird,\" starring Barry Keoghan and Franz Rogowski.\n\nSure to draw attention will be Ali Abbasi's \"The Apprentice,\" a film about the former president's early business career. In it, Sebastian Stan stars as Trump, Jeremy Strong plays Roy Cohn and Maria Bakalova co-stars as Ivana Trump. The Iranian director Abbasi was previously in competition at Cannes with 2022's \"Holy Spider.\"\n\nNumerous other big-name filmmakers are also returning to Cannes, which runs May 14-25. Among them: David Cronenberg (\"The Shrouds,\" with Vincent Cassel and Diane Kruger); Paul Schrader (\"Oh, Canada,\" with Richard Gere and Uma Thurman) and the lauded Chinese director Jia Zhang-Ke (\"Caught By the Tides\").\n\nAlso in competition are Sean Baker (\"Anora\"), whose \"Red Rocket\" and \"The Florida Project\" also premiered at Cannes and the French filmmaker Jacques Audiard (\"Emilia Perez\"), who won the Palme in 2015 for \"Dheepan.\"\n\nAs previously reported, Francis Ford Coppola's \"Megalopolis\" will premiere in competition in Cannes. The 85-year-old director's self-financed, long-gestating epic will debut 50 years after his \"The Conversation\" won the Palme d'Or.\n\nThis year's Cannes follows a banner 2023 edition that featured the premieres of three films that went on to win best-picture nominations at the Academy Awards: Martin Scorsese's \"Killers of the Flower Moon\"; Jonathan Glazer's \"The Zone of Interest\" and Justine Triet's Palme d'Or winner \"Anatomy of a Fall.\"\n\n\"Anatomy of a Fall\" was only the third film directed by a woman to win the Palme. This year, there are four female filmmakers in competition. Fremaux said he may add further selections in the coming weeks.\n\nCannes had already lined up a few notable world premieres playing out of competition including George Miller's \"Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga\" and Kevin Costner's \"Horizon, An American Saga.\"\n\nGeorge Lucas is set to receive an honorary Palme d'Or at the closing ceremony. The festival will kick off May 14 with the French comedy \"The Second Act,\" starring Lea Seydoux and Vincent Lindon.\n\nGreta Gerwig, coming off the success of \"Barbie,\" is heading the jury that will decide the Palme d'Or.\n\nSome entries will take on added poignance, Fremaux noted, due to current events. The first selection he announced Thursday was Yolande Zauberman's documentary \"The Beauty of Gaza,\" about transgender Palestinians who emigrate to Tel Aviv. Ukrainian filmmaker Sergei Loznitsa will debut his documentary \"The Invasion,\" on Russia's war on his native country.\n\nOne new addition this year: The festival is launching a competitive immersive section featuring works of virtual and augmented reality.",

        "text": "There is a bit of a myth about Russia's army in Ukraine. That Moscow's soldiers are inexperienced, ramshackle troops sent into hopeless charges at well-defended positions at the behest of inexperienced and brutal commanders. They have little tactical sense and even less strategic vision.\n\nOf course, some of that is true - the Russians do use 'meatgrinder' assaults, armoured columns often do run into trouble in Ukrainian minefields (with pyrotechnic results) and Russia frequently relies on troops with insufficient training and poor kit.\n\nEven today, huge numbers of armoured vehicles and tanks are being lost as Russian forces attempt to advance and it's a live question how long such losses can be borne.\n\nBut the Russians aren't stupid, and the army does learn, albeit slowly.\n\nIn this episode of Defence in Depth, David Knowles, presenter on The Telegraph's 'Ukraine: The Latest' podcast, explains what Russia's army does well, how it has adapted, why this worries Ukraine, and why it should worry the West.",

        "title": "Food Security and Food Safety in Africa Must Go Hand in Hand",
        "text": "LUSAKA, Zambia, Apr 12 (IPS) - Monica Musonda, CEO, Java Foods, and Board Member, Partners in Food Solutions (PFS)Russia's invasion of Ukraine has restricted international exports and sent food costs soaring - particularly for vulnerable populations still experiencing shocks from the pandemic and who can least afford to pay more to feed their families. Two years on, global food supply chains are still just as susceptible to serious disruptions caused by war, disease, and climate change. Those inevitable disruptions are leaving those on the African continent particularly vulnerable.\n\nEnsuring people have access to safe and nutritious food at an affordable price helps prevent malnutrition, boosts human capital, and improves health outcomes by decreasing susceptibility to a wide range of diseases. But none of this is possible if the local food supply is not safe for people to eat. Food security and food safety must go hand in hand, yet across Africa this remains a challenge. The continent has some of the highest rates of foodborne illness in the world. Globally, nearly half a million people die each year because of something they ate. Food scares are not only harmful for anyone who eats contaminated food, but also erodes trust of consumers in the products they buy for their families. To ensure a secure food supply, locally produced food must not only be readily available but also be safe for consumers to eat, meeting the same high-quality standards seen in imports. But small and medium-sized companies in Africa struggle to meet international food safety standards, which often go above what is required on a national level. The process can be complicated, expensive, and time consuming, yet I believe it is vital for African food companies to seek these certifications to build consumer confidence and strengthen continental food security. I started Java Foods, a food company based in Lusaka, Zambia, out of the recognition that Africa imports large quantities of food, despite the fact that the continent is able to grow a diversity of crops. Our company focuses on using locally grown raw materials in our products, which we've designed specifically for the changing tastes of the youthful Zambian population. One of our most successful products are packaged instant noodles, under the brand name eeZee, which are made with locally grown wheat fortified with 17 micronutrients, including iron and zinc. Although we produce processed foods, we want to ensure the highest nutritional value possible for our consumers who seek accessible and affordable food options. Maintaining high-quality food safety standards is the right thing to do for the consumer, and it has been the right thing to do for Java Foods - even if it has required significant investments in our facility and in our people. Food safety certification has to be paid for. The different sets of standards are run by private companies, which require food producers to buy the certification they want to implement and renew the certification every couple of years. Audits to ensure compliance are also costly. With technical assistance from Partners in Food Solutions, a nonprofit which links African food producers with corporate volunteers from U.S.-based food companies, Java Foods was able to receive support in redesigning our plant to ensure we'll be compliant with international food safety standards. Our employees benefited from skills transfer using online conferencing tools that dramatically increased their professional skills and contributions to our team. In addition to making changes to our factory floor plan, we also began a meticulous documentation process to create the records necessary to demonstrate that we were following the same standards to a T on every single batch of instant noodles. Our staff are central to getting this right, so Java Foods has created a culture where our employees understand why we take these extra steps, and take pride in ensuring our compliance. It is possible for other companies to follow in Java's footsteps. There are several ways we can improve the food safety certification system to mutually benefit consumers, food processors, and regulating authorities. In addition to better awareness of the existence of food safety standards and why companies should seek such certification to benefit their consumers, there needs to be more coordination on a regional and global level. Java Foods exports our products to neighboring countries, but each can require different steps to comply with their local regulations. Exporting our noodles to Zimbabwe, for example, requires us to complete an extra step not required elsewhere. This means we shoulder extra expenses to expand our market, which cannot be passed along to the consumer because we make a low-cost product. Differing food safety standards become a trade barrier not only restricting the growth of businesses in Africa, but restricting food security as strengthening regional supply chains remains hampered by cumbersome regulations. Local governments need more support to strengthen their food safety quality control capacity. This includes the facilities they provide for testing for food contaminants such as aflatoxins, from a mold that can develop on some crops when they aren't stored properly. We also need better information sharing and data availability. Having information readily available online when our staff encounter an issue would save time and resources. Although it was laborious, Java Foods has immensely benefited from the decision to seek international food safety certification. The standards allow us to expand the market for our products, and we must ensure other companies can easily join us to strengthen Africa's food security. Monica Musonda is the CEO of Java Foods, a food manufacturing company in Lusaka, Zambia. She serves on the board of Partners in Food Solutions, a nonprofit organization that provides pro bono consulting services to African food processors.",

        "text": "There is a bit of a myth about Russia's army in Ukraine. That Moscow's soldiers are inexperienced, ramshackle troops sent into hopeless charges at well-defended positions at the behest of inexperienced and brutal commanders. They have little tactical sense and even less strategic vision.\n\nOf course, some of that is true - the Russians do use 'meatgrinder' assaults, armoured columns often do run into trouble in Ukrainian minefields (with pyrotechnic results) and Russia frequently relies on troops with insufficient training and poor kit.\n\nEven today, huge numbers of armoured vehicles and tanks are being lost as Russian forces attempt to advance and it's a live question how long such losses can be borne.\n\nBut the Russians aren't stupid, and the army does learn, albeit slowly.\n\nIn this episode of Defence in Depth, David Knowles, presenter on The Telegraph's 'Ukraine: The Latest' podcast, explains what Russia's army does well, how it has adapted, why this worries Ukraine, and why it should worry the West.",

        "title": "Niger's future after the end of military cooperation with the US",
        "text": "A few weeks ago, Niger's ruling military junta announced the suspension with immediate effect of the military agreement allowing the presence of US military and civilian personnel on its territory. The coup government spokesman stopped short of demanding that US personnel leave, but stressed that their presence violates sovereignty.\n\nFollowing this declaration, defence cooperation between Niger and the US is expected to end, as well as the departure of US forces from Niger, which will facilitate the deployment of Russian paramilitary personnel in the country, as has happened elsewhere in the Sahel.\n\nIn 2023, the year of the coup d'\u00e9tat, there were around 1,100 US troops in Niger. Bilateral defence cooperation between Niamey and Washington includes, in particular, an agreement allowing the presence of around 1,000 US civilian and military personnel, as well as two military installations in Niger, including Air Base 201 near Agadez, which is essential for US surveillance and counter-terrorism operations in Niger and neighbouring Libya.\n\nHowever, the US is not the only country in the crosshairs of Niger's new military regime. After the July 2023 uprising against democratically elected president Mohamed Bazoum, the new government immediately suspended military cooperation with France, prompting Paris to withdraw its forces in December.\n\nFrance criticised Niger's coup immediately after it took place, unlike the US, which initially adopted a more cautious approach towards its leaders in the hope of retaining its military facilities in the country. Attempts to ensure a rapid transition to civilian leadership were unsuccessful, however, and US President Joe Biden's administration eventually labelled Bazoum's overthrow a coup d'\u00e9tat in October 2023.\n\nThis led the US authorities to suspend all forms of non-humanitarian security cooperation, including defence. This was accompanied by France's decision to withdraw its forces from the country, which reinforced the military junta's need to develop relations with new partners such as Russia, further deteriorating relations with Washington.\n\nThese tensions came to a head during a US diplomatic trip to Niger last March. During the visit, the US delegation reiterated its demands, calling for a credible transition timetable for civilian leadership before the US resumes defence cooperation. They also warned Niamey against further cooperation with Russia and Iran.\n\nNiger's military leaders cannot respond to Washington's demands without compromising their control over the country. Indeed, the military junta decided to take advantage of tensions with the West to strengthen its power and end defence cooperation in order to reinforce its image in terms of sovereignty and anti-imperialism in the eyes of the Nigerien public.\n\nRegarding relations with Russia and Iran, it is worth noting that Niamey and Tehran have strengthened their ties in recent months. There has even been talk of a possible deal whereby Niger would supply uranium to Iran, although the logistics of this alleged deal remain in doubt, as Niger has only one major uranium mine in production, currently run by the French state-owned company Orano.\n\nIn addition to strengthening ties with Iran, Niger has signed a defence protocol agreement with Russia in which both sides pledge to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the fields of defence, agriculture and energy.\n\nAll of these moves by Niger's authorities are forcing the US to withdraw its forces in the nation, which will undermine Washington's ability to monitor jihadist activity in the Sahel.\n\nAfter the military junta declared the US military presence in Niger \"illegal\", most of the Nigerien public expects US forces to leave the country. Should this not happen and the authorities fail to deliver on their promises, it would create a political challenge, as the new regime based its legitimacy on promises to restore Niger's full sovereignty, as stated by the head of the military junta, General Abdourahamane Tchiani.\n\nShould the military regime allow the US to maintain some military presence in the country - there are still sections of the Nigerien army that support it - this could raise the possibility of a new coup d'\u00e9tat by the more anti-Western elements of the military junta.\n\nAs Tchiani prioritises the consolidation of his power, it seems likely that the US will be forced to evacuate its forces and military installations from Niger over the next year. However, it is possible that this process could be postponed, as the Biden administration is likely to continue to pressure Tchiani not to suspend defence cooperation altogether.\n\nIt is also possible that Washington will accelerate its efforts to establish a drone base in other parts of West Africa, such as Ghana, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire or Benin. While the establishment of a new drone base in one of these locations will help the US monitor potential jihadist challenges in West African coastal areas, it will not be useful for monitoring jihadist activity in the Sahel due to its geographical distance from the area.\n\nThis African region is experiencing a deployment of Russian paramilitary personnel, as well as an expansion of jihadist activity. It is possible that this is the future that awaits Niger should it suspend its defence ties with Washington.\n\nDespite instability and violence in many Sahelian countries, Niger's junta appears to be willing to follow in the footsteps of military leaders in Mali and Burkina Faso by requesting the deployment of Russian paramilitary personnel in the country.\n\nWhile such military backing could help the Niger junta consolidate its power, the arrival of Russian paramilitary personnel in the country will contribute to undermining the country's security in the medium term, as Russia's African Legion does not have the same military capabilities as the US or French armies.\n\nIn this regard, it should also be noted that Russian forces deployed in African countries have committed numerous human rights violations against civilians, which in Niger will facilitate recruitment efforts by jihadist groups such as the al-Qaeda-linked Islamic and Muslim Support Group and Daesh in the Sahel.\n\nDespite this, Tchiani held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the end of March in which the two leaders agreed on the 'need' to strengthen bilateral security cooperation. This conversation came shortly after the suspension of defence cooperation with the US.\n\nHowever, Niger will also continue to develop relations with other non-Western countries in order to avoid excessive dependence on Moscow, as has happened to other countries in the region. This may boost competition among Middle Eastern and North African countries seeking closer ties with Niamey.\n\nThe deployment of Russian paramilitary personnel in Niger will allow Moscow to strengthen its influence over the junta. But the military council's domestic diplomatic and political needs will push it to further develop its relations with other nations, such as Iran.\n\nAli Lamine Zeine, Niger's junta-appointed prime minister, met with Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi during his official visit to Tehran in January. The Iranian leader praised Niger's \"path to independence and freedom\" before the two sides signed agreements to strengthen health, economic and political cooperation.\n\nArab Gulf states can also play a role in gaining a stronger presence in Niger due to their fears of expanding Iranian influence in Africa. Expanding this cooperation between the Gulf states and Niger could pave the way for much-needed foreign investment in the country.\n\nNiger will also continue to strengthen relations with Turkey, which has provided Niamey with military support before and after the July 2023 coup, in addition to funding development initiatives.\n\nIn this regard, Ankara delivered six Bayraktar TB3 drones to Niger during May 2022 and continued its efforts to train the Nigerien army after the July 2023 coup.\n\nWithin the continent, Morocco is expected to further strengthen its ties with Niger, as well as with Mali and Burkina Faso, especially by pushing ahead with plans to help Western Sahel countries diversify their maritime outlets through Moroccan ports.\n\nWhile the Atlantic Initiative seems unlikely to be achieved in the medium term due to infrastructure problems, this project highlights the Kingdom's ambition to strengthen its position as a regional and continental leader.\n\nThese moves are likely to increase competition between Morocco and Algeria for regional leadership. Meanwhile, Niger's junta will seek to exploit this rivalry to maximise investment commitments on both sides.",

        "title": "IntelBrief: Radicalization and Extremism in Russia's North Caucasus Region",
        "text": "Platforms gaining popularity among North Caucasian youth like \"KavkazCenter.org\" and \"ChechenInfo\" have been recognized as the information agency of the current Caucasian Emirate, an extremist jihadi group, rumored to be experiencing a resurgence.\n\nIn the wake of the recent terrorist attack on Moscow's Crocus City Hall, which resulted in at least 140 people killed, discussions have increasingly focused on the motivations and identity of the perpetrators. The attack has been attributed to Islamic State Khorasan Province (IS-K), a regional faction of Islamic State (ISIS). However, the four individuals accused of executing this assault are Tajik nationals purportedly under IS-K's command. Tajikistan and other countries in Central Asia have become major recruitment areas for IS-K. In Tajikistan, militants frequently emerge from the ranks of migrant workers in Russia, who often face discrimination abroad, as well as from impoverished local communities. While IS-K's recruitment efforts are primarily focused on Central Asia, the continuous risk of radicalization in the North Caucasus, especially within the Russian Republics of Chechnya, Dagestan, and Ingushetia, has been somewhat underestimated recently.\n\nBefore the Crocus City Hall incident, individuals from the North Caucasus were the main perpetrators of terrorist attacks in Russia. They constituted a significant portion of Islamic State's forces in Syria less than a decade ago. Russian was the second most common language taught in Islamic State schools during the peak of its so-called caliphate. Although the security situation in the region has since improved, incidents of violent extremism within domestic borders and attacks by North Caucasian individuals in Europe are still prevalent. While attacks have been comparatively low in Ingushetia in 2023, regional authorities have still stated that they are grappling with extremist violence and terrorist acts, positioning it as the most impacted Northern Caucasian republic. There have been various targeted attacks on law enforcement, police forces, and other security personnel. That same year, there was an assault on an Ingush traffic police outpost that killed several police officers. Issues of radicalization and violence continue to pose serious concerns in the North Caucasus and among the diaspora, notably among the younger population whose formative years were shaped by the First Chechen War (1994-1996) and the Second Chechen War (1999-2009) with Russia, a post-Soviet separatist conflict.\n\nJihadists arrived in Chechnya toward the end of the First Chechen War, shifting the nature of the conflict and setting the stage for the next decade. The Second Chechen War saw local separatists lose almost complete influence to jihadist elements, with the struggle against Russian control gaining a broader, universal jihadist dimension. In later years, the conflict extended beyond Chechnya, influencing jihadist movements regionally, inspiring extremism and radicalization in Dagestan and Ingushetia, and leading to notable terrorist attacks in Russia. In 2013, the death of a prominent Chechen rebel Dokka Umarov, the creator of the North Caucasian jihadist movement \"Caucasian Emirate\", coupled with the rise of Islamic State, led many North Caucasians to join the global jihadist movement, reflecting the transformation of the Caucasian insurgency into a transnational phenomenon. While Russia crushed the separatist movements, the broader jihadist elements are still prevalent in the region.\n\nRussia's scorched earth counterinsurgency campaign across the North Caucasus, but especially in Chechnya, has been extreme, with widespread reports of human rights abuses such as torture, summary executions, and hostage-taking, under the policy of collective responsibility implemented by Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov. This policy holds families and relatives of insurgents accountable, resulting in reported abuses by security forces not just in Chechnya but abroad. In 2019, a Chechen separatist was shot dead in Germany by a Russian operative. In 2020, a Kadyrov critic was found murdered in France. In 2022, another critic of the Chechen leader survived an assassination attempt in Sweden. These crackdowns, while quelling domestic violence in the past decade, are believed to have only further radicalized jihadists and their supporters. Russian special services regularly report on these anti-terrorism measures, indicating Moscow's concern about regional security risks.\n\nHowever, the transnational violence is not limited to the alleged attempts of the Russian or Chechen government to silence dissidents in Europe. In recent years, diaspora members from the North Caucasus have been implicated in terrorist activities across Europe. In 2020, a Chechen teenager and his associates beheaded a French secondary school teacher. In 2023, a 20-year-old Ingush man, after proclaiming loyalty to Islamic State, stabbed a teacher to death and injured three students in France. In the same year, Belgian authorities arrested seven men, almost all of them Chechens, for their alleged connections to ISIS. Although Caucasian migrant communities are largely insular, some younger individuals have begun to interact and form connections with radicals from various backgrounds through online channels. While platforms like Telegram can facilitate broader radicalization among Islamic extremists, newer platforms connected to the Caucasian Emirate, which declined during the conflict in Syria but has been rumored to have enjoyed a recent resurgence, are also becoming more attractive to North Caucasian youth. Digital platforms like \"KavkazCenter.org\" and \"ChechenInfo\" have been recognized as the information agency of the current Caucasian Emirate. They disseminate propaganda videos that focus on the jihadist element in the North Caucasus, resistance against the Russian Federation, and the involvement of North Caucasian fighters in the Ukraine conflict, which has also served as a radicalizing factor in recent years. In 2023, Russian authorities arrested a 23-year-old Ingush who was accused of distributing information on and justifying the activities of the Caucasian Emirate on \"VKontakte,\" a Russian social media site.\n\nGrowing discontent among North Caucasian youth cannot be solely attributed to aggressive online propaganda. Persecution of Muslims in the region has caused the ideas of the Caucasian Emirate and ISIS to resonate strongly in the region. In 1999, Wahhabism, an austere strand of Sunni Islam, was banned in Dagestan, where Russian persecution of Muslims has been among the most extreme. In 2016, A popular Salafi imam, for example, was reportedly tortured and imprisoned in a penal colony for \"justifying jihadi violence\" even though he had faced threats years prior from Dagestani militants for condemning ISIS. Months later, two young boys were killed by a Dagestani official - they were allegedly mistaken for insurgents. Polls from 2019 revealed that 14.5 percent of high school students and 9 percent of teachers in Dagestan showed support for compatriots who joined ISIS. Given the legal risks in Russia for endorsing ISIS, a banned organization since 2014, it is likely that the actual number of sympathizers in Dagestan is significantly higher than reported. However, the persecution of Muslims in the North Caucasus, particularly by Russia, is not limited to Dagestan. This played a large factor in the radicalization of individuals across the region. With the Syrian conflict in somewhat of a stalemate, the return of ISIS foreign fighters could strengthen the influence of radical groups like the Caucasian Emirate in the region, especially considering the heavy-handed approach from regional authorities. Such an influx, combined with the severe counter-insurgency tactics employed by Russian and regional governments, is expected to exacerbate the problem.",

        "title": "How India's Beaches Can Unlock a Nuclear-powered Future",
        "text": "India's indigenous nuclear reactor prototype and abundant thorium reserves hold the key to the country's future energy security.\n\nIndia's Kerala state is famous for its languid beauty, laidback lifestyle, and stunning beaches. But it's what lies beneath that has the country's nuclear industry excited. Kerala is also home to a massive amount of thorium, which India's nuclear scientists see as the prospective mineral to help fuel an indigenous nuclear power program.\n\nIndeed, India has the largest thorium deposits in the world, with the golden beaches of Odisha in eastern India also home to the prized mineral. Together, Kerala and Odisha account for over 70 percent of India's thorium.\n\nThe reason for the fuss is understandable: India's Department of Atomic Energy (DoAE) scientists consider thorium as a \"practically inexhaustible energy source\" that will not emit greenhouse gasses.\n\nIndia's first home-built prototype fast breeder reactor, the 500 megawatt Kalpakkam nuclear plant in Tamil Nadu, which has undergone successful tests, offers a glimpse of how thorium can help power the nation.\n\nThorium itself is not enough. It needs to be converted to uranium-233 in a reactor before it can be used as fuel. The Kalpakkam reactor demonstrated that this conversion is possible.\n\nAs of 2014, India's Department of Atomic Energy (DoAE) claimed to have \"established 11.93 million tonnes of in situ resources of monazite (thorium-bearing mineral)\" in six Indian states. These reserves contain about 1.07 million tonnes of thorium.\n\nLast month Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi took time out from his election campaign to visit the Kalpakkam power plant to witness the \"commencement of core loading.\"\n\nThe plant's successful core-loading is a benchmark development to achieve India's sustainable nuclear energy security. Once operational, the plant will mark the critical second stage in India's three-stage nuclear power program. Following the core loading process, the Kalpakkam reactor will undergo its first approach to criticality, leading to power generation.\n\nGiven India's patchy uranium reserves and the Nuclear Supply Group's substantial multilateral export control regime on the supply of nuclear materials, equipment and technology, policymakers have, for some time, been working on a long-term goal of utilizing indigenously available thorium.\n\nWhile thorium is no magic metal or a nuclear fuel by and in itself, it can, however, be used to create such a fuel.\n\nResearchers agree that thorium-232, \"the only naturally occurring isotope of thorium, is considered 'fertile' for fission.\" But it needs a \"driver,\" such as uranium and plutonium, to \"trigger and maintain a chain reaction.\" When sufficiently irradiated, thorium-232 undergoes a series of nuclear reactions. This leads to forming uranium-233 which can then be \"split\" to release energy to power a nuclear reactor.\n\nIn a June 2019 statement in the Indian Parliament, the government said that the Department of Atomic Energy \"planned the use of large deposits of thorium available in the country as a long-term option.\" But this decision was not entirely new. It was part of an old plan that tied in with Atomic Energy department scientists and officials' previously laid out three-stage nuclear power program.\n\nIf India can use its thorium, it will it from dependence on the uncertain uranium supply chain regime.\n\nIn simpler terms, the three-stage nuclear power program aimed to multiply the \"domestically available\" fissile resource through the use of natural uranium in Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs), followed by the use of plutonium obtained from the spent fuel of PHWRs in Fast Breeder Reactors. \"Large scale use of thorium\" will follow, making use of uranium-233 that will be \"bred\" in reactors.\n\nFive years ago, the government took steps \"towards technology development and demonstration\" to ultimately put in place a \"mature technology\" so that thorium utilization was \"available in time.\"\n\nWhile domestic energy self-sufficiency was the goal, India is also caught up in a thorium-related global race that underscores the geopolitics surrounding this \"power\" metal.\n\nIn June 2023, China took steps to issue an \"operating permit\" for an \"experimental molten salt thorium nuclear reactor.\" This reactor, located in the Gobi Desert, will be put through tests in the next few years. The United States, United Kingdom, and Japan are said to have shown enthusiasm for research in the application of thorium in nuclear power.\n\nPart of the Indian determination to pursue an indigenous course on nuclear energy was the lack of any significant movement by the U.S. on commercially providing nuclear reactors. This may have stemmed from past U.S. governmental and suppliers' \"anxieties\" even after the July 2005 civil nuclear agreement that did not bear much fruit insofar as India was concerned.\n\nMutual India-U.S. trust and confidence appeared to have been restored in 2023 when the Biden administration sought to begin \"tangibly consummating\" the accord \"by completing the negotiations for nuclear reactor sales to India.\"\n\nThis could give an impetus India-U.S. collaboration in nuclear energy in general and \"development of next generation small modular reactor technologies in a collaborative mode\" in particular.\n\nAt the same time, a potential deal between India and France for the construction of six new large European Pressurized Reactors at Jaitapur in Maharashtra has not been concluded. Negotiations with the French supplier, Electricite de France, unexpectedly stalled because of \"unresolved problems,\" including liability. This relates to payments in the event of an accident.\n\nIndia's nuclear cooperation with Canada dates back several years. A bilateral agreement was signed between the DoAE and Canada's Cameco in 2015 in which Cameco would supply 3220.50 tonnes of \"uranium concentrate\" under a long-term contract through 2020 for India to meet its energy needs.\n\nWhile the governments agreed in February 2018 to \"expand the on ongoing mutually-beneficial civil nuclear cooperation,\" there has been little tangible progress on the ground.\n\nAs recently as March, it was revealed that Russia's state-owned atomic energy company, Rosatom, was in negotiations with India for a \"possible supply of technology\" for small modular reactors, which can be constructed in about four years and rely on comparatively less water consumption.\n\nThe slowdown in partnership commitments of Western nuclear powers prompted India's government to make \"sustained efforts\" in \"different areas of thorium fuel cycle,\" which was aligned with the much tom-tommed \"self-sufficiency\" in critical and sensitive areas.\n\nThe DoAE's efforts are directed at enlarging the current thorium-related research and development work and activities to a bigger scale and toward development of technologies. However, the commercial utilization of thorium on a \"significant scale can begin only when abundant supplies of either uranium-233 or plutonium resources are available.\"\n\nIndian researchers and scientists agree that it will take decades before the commercial establishment of the Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) stage is achieved. But some researchers say it is \"possible to considerably advance\" the thorium stage if certain technical processes are deployed before the DoAE takes steps to enter the FBR stage on a big scale.\n\nNotwithstanding the delay, thorium-based systems will be a game-changer in decarbonizing India's energy sector, especially when it aims to treble its nuclear power generation capacity by 2030 to \"meet the twin goals of energy security and sustainable development.\"\n\nWhile India has taken major steps on thorium-related research and is a recognized partner in most fora under the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it remains an outsider in other multilateral collectives that focus on thorium-based systems.",

        "title": "Many say Biden and Trump did more harm than good, but for different reasons, AP-NORC poll shows",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- There's a reason why President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are spending so much time attacking each other -- people don't think either man has much to brag about when it comes to his own record. Americans generally think that while they were in the White House, both did more harm than good on key issues.\n\nBut the two candidates have different weak spots. For Biden, it's widespread unhappiness on two issues: the economy and immigration. Trump, meanwhile, faces an electorate where substantial shares think he harmed the country on a range of issues.\n\nA new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that more than half of U.S. adults think Biden's presidency has hurt the country on cost of living and immigration, while nearly half think Trump's presidency hurt the country on voting rights and election security, relations with foreign countries, abortion laws and climate change.\n\n\"Considering the price of gas, the price of groceries, the economy -- I did very well during those four years,\" Christina Elliott, 60, a Republican from Texas, said of the Trump presidency. \"I didn't have to worry about filling up my tank or losing half of my paycheck to the grocery store.\"\n\nElliott wasn't too keen on Trump's handling of abortion and said that when it comes to the former president's rhetoric, \"He just needs to learn how to be tactful and shut his mouth.\"\n\n\"But other than that, like I said, I did very well during the Trump years,\" she added.\n\nThe polling underscores why certain issues -- such as abortion for Biden and immigration for Trump -- have been persistent focal points for each of the campaigns. The former president regularly decries the number of asylum-seekers who have arrived in the U.S. under Biden, describing the situation in apocalyptic and dark terms. And Biden has gone on the offensive against Trump on abortion, especially after this week's ruling from the Arizona Supreme Court that essentially criminalized the procedure in the state.\n\nWhen asked which president did more to help people like them, roughly one-third say Donald Trump and about one-quarter say Joe Biden. Yet 30% of adults said neither Biden nor Trump benefitted them. It's another data point reflecting an electorate that has been largely disappointed with this year's general election choices, generating little enthusiasm among key parts of the Biden and Trump political coalitions.\n\nAmericans rate Biden particularly negatively on a few specific issues. Only about 2 in 10 Americans think Biden's presidency helped \"a lot\" or \"a little\" on cost of living, and 16% say that about immigration and border security. Nearly 6 in 10 say his presidency hurt a lot or a little on these issues. Nearly half, 46%, of Americans, by contrast, say that Trump's presidency helped a lot or a little on immigration or border security. Four in 10 say it helped on cost of living.\n\nTexas resident Trelicia Mornes, 36, said she feels the Biden presidency has hurt a lot when it comes to everyday expenses.\n\n\"Now that he's in the office, the cost of living has spiked out of control, and there's nothing being done about it,\" Mornes, a Democrat, said, pointing to rising costs of rent and food. She said she believes Biden can do more, \"He just chooses to do other things.\"\n\nThe pandemic hurt Trump in terms of employment as the economy lost 2.7 million jobs under his watch. But the pandemic lockdowns also dramatically curbed inflation. At the same time, low interest rates and historic levels of deficit-funded government stimulus left many households feeling better off under Trump.\n\nComing out of the pandemic, Biden gave the economy a boost with additional aid that helped spur job gains of 15.2 million under his watch. But supply chain issues, Russia's war in Ukraine and Biden's aid package are judged by many economists as having contributed to rising inflation, hurting the Democrat's approval ratings.\n\nTrump's advantage on the cost of living and immigration is driven partially by Democrats' lack of enthusiasm about Biden's performance. About one-third of Democrats, for example, think Biden's presidency hurt on cost of living, and another third think Biden neither helped nor hurt. Just one-third of Democrats think Biden's presidency helped on cost of living. About 3 in 10 Democrats think Biden's presidency helped on immigration and border security, a similar share think his presidency hurt, and about 4 in 10 think it made no difference.\n\nNadia Stepicheva, 38, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, is unhappy with how Biden has handled immigration.\n\n\"The problem is, I really don't like illegal type of immigration,\" Stepicheva said. She thinks that people who enter the U.S., even if they come in illegally, should be allowed to work so that taxpayer dollars aren't used to care for them and house them.\n\nStepicheva said she has always leaned in favor of Democrats and the party's policies, \"But the last four years, I feel like it's getting too much in terms of money spent for immigration, forgiving all these student loans.\" She said she's torn in terms of who she will vote for this November.\n\nBut independents also rate Biden low on these issues: Nearly 6 in 10 independents say Biden's presidency has hurt the country on cost of living. About 4 in 10 independents say Biden's presidency has hurt the country when it comes to the cost of health care and relations with other countries.\n\nTrump has a different problem.\n\nThe former president doesn't have any asked-about issues where more than half of Americans think he did more to hurt things than to help, but the overall sense of harm is somewhat broader. Nearly half of Americans think his presidency did more to hurt than help on climate change, voting rights and election security, abortion laws and relations with foreign countries.\n\nCatherine Scott, a Republican who recently moved to New York from Florida, said she found Trump's approach to foreign policy particularly concerning.\n\n\"I understand that some people really admire Trump's ability to be a spitfire and just say whatever is at the top of his mind,\" said Scott, 30. But, pointing to Trump's complimentary comments toward autocrats like Russian President Vladimir Putin, Scott said, \"I don't think he has all the foresight to understand that might not always be the thing to do.\"\n\nThe best issue for both Biden and Trump overall is job creation. Trump has a small edge here: Nearly half say his presidency helped, while 36% say Biden's presidency helped. About half of Americans also think Trump's presidency helped on immigration and 4 in 10 think his presidency helped on cost of living.\n\nOn every other issue, the share of Americans who say that Biden or Trump helped the country a lot or a little is around 3 in 10 or less. But Republicans, overall, tend to see more of a benefit from Trump's presidency than Democrats do from Biden's -- even on issues where Biden has worked to highlight his victories.\n\nFor example, only about half of Democrats say that Biden's presidency has helped on climate change or the cost of health care. On abortion laws, 77% of Democrats think that Trump's presidency was at least a little harmful, but only about 4 in 10 say that Biden's presidency helped a lot or a little, and a similar share think Biden's presidency hasn't made a difference.\n\nMeanwhile, around 8 in 10 Republicans say that Trump's presidency helped on immigration and border security, creating jobs and cost of living.\n\n--\n\nThe poll of 1,204 adults was conducted April 4-8, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.\n\n--\n\nAssociated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.",

        "text": "Washington, DC [US], April 12 (ANI): The United States' defence commitments to Japan and the Philippines are \"ironclad,\" US President Joe Biden said on Thursday as he hosted the first-ever trilateral summit between the three countries, welcoming Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr to the White House a day after the official visit of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, CNN reported.\n\nThe US-Japan-Philippines trilateral comes after the creation of groupings in the Indo-Pacific, starting with the Quad, comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan, and the AUKUS, consisting of Australia, the US and the UK, amid increasing concerns over China's military muscle-flexing in the region.\n\n\"When we stand as one, we're able to forge a better future for all,\" Biden said in the East Room of the White House Thursday.\n\nAccording to CNN, tensions between the Philippines and China have been focused on the Second Thomas Shoal, situated approximately 200 kilometres off the coast of Palawan, Philippines. In the 1990s, the Philippines intentionally grounded an aging World War II-era navy transport ship on the shoal to reinforce its territorial claim. The ship is now mostly a rusted wreckage and is manned by Filipino marines stationed on rotation.\n\nMeanwhile, China asserts sovereignty over the shoal, located within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, as part of its broader claims in the South China Sea, disregarding an international arbitration ruling.\n\nRecent clashes have occurred when Philippine attempts to resupply the forces on the ship have been met by China Coast Guard ships firing water cannons at the Philippine resupply boats, resulting in injuries to Filipino sailors and damage to the vessels, as per CNN.\n\nBiden said on Thursday, referencing the Filipino-Chinese tensions, that \"any attack on Philippine aircraft, vessels or armed forces in the South China Sea would invoke our mutual defence treaty.\"The 1951 mutual defence treaty between the US and the Philippines, the oldest of its kind in the Asia-Pacific region, obligates both nations to come to each other's defence in the event of an attack by a third party.\n\nThursday's meeting signifies the administration's ongoing efforts to address Chinese aggression, with a senior administration official expressing deep concern over China's actions in the South China Sea, and affirming at the head of the meeting that the White House is very concerned by China's actions in the South China Sea.\n\n\"What you'll see is a clear demonstration of support and resolve from both President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida that we stand shoulder to shoulder with Marcos, ready to support and work with the Philippines at every turn,\" one official said ahead of Thursday's meeting.\n\nMarcos said on Thursday that the Philippines, Japan and the United States \"meet today as friends and partners bound by a shared vision in pursuit of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.\"The three countries, Marcos added, are \"linked by a profound respect for democracy, good governance and the rule of law.\"The meeting coincides with heightened concerns over China's assertive stance towards Taiwan and the South China Sea, coupled with nuclear provocations from North Korea and its evolving ties with Russia. These concerns have prompted regional allies to draw closer to the US.\n\nJapan has emerged as a focal point in President Biden's efforts to strengthen alliances in the Indo-Pacific. Prime Minister Kishida has been viewed as a cooperative partner, having made significant adjustments to Japan's defence strategy in recent years. Additionally, Japan has provided ongoing support to Ukraine in the wake of Russia's invasion, demonstrating its commitment to international security. Kishida has pledged to increase defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP by 2037 and has bolstered Japan's counterstrike capabilities by acquiring American Tomahawk missiles.\n\nBiden hosted Marcos at the White House last year, showing his intent to reestablish strong ties with Manila that had frayed under former President Rodrigo Duterte, who sought closer relations with China.\n\n\"We're going to continue to support the Philippines military's modernization goals,\" Biden told the visiting leader during that visit, pledging the two nations \"not only share a strong partnership, we share a deep friendship, one that has been enriched by millions of Filipino Americans in the communities all across the United States.\"A highlight of Thursday's meeting was several announcements meant to bolster the Philippines.\n\nA senior administration official also said that on Thursday, the White House will be announcing a new infrastructure project in the Philippines. CNN reported earlier this week that one of the announcements will be the development of a new rail and shipping corridor between the Philippines's Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base, a move that's meant to send a clear message to Beijing.\n\nBiden briefly referenced that economic corridor on Thursday: \"It means more jobs for people across the entire region,\" he said. \"It means more investment in sectors critical to our future: clean energy, ports, railroads, agriculture and much more.\"The White House is also expected to increase the Filipino military's capability with a new infrastructure investment similar to what the US announced in India in the lead-up to the G20.\n\nIn the days leading up to the summit, the US, Japan and the Philippines along with Australia, conducted maritime military exercises near the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), after Philippine vessels had alleged \"harassment\" by Chinese ships in the South China Sea.\n\nThe senior official added that the White House will also be making announcements about \"Open Radio Access Network technology\" and that both the US and Japan will be providing millions of dollars in funding.\n\nOfficials also said they will announce an upcoming Coast Guard patrol in the Indo-Pacific that will take place \"in the coming year.\" (ANI)",

        "title": "NATO Comes to Switzerland, Goodbye Neutrality? - Russia News Now",
        "text": "Sweden and Finland have joined NATO. Will Switzerland be next? In a small step in that direction, NATO will soon open an office in Geneva. Does NATO's presence, however small - sources say only one NATO officer will be based in Geneva - represent a historic change for a country that has been legally neutral since 1815? Although the office is presented as a multilateral liaison with international organizations - NATO has similar offices in Vienna and New York - it does raise questions about Swiss neutrality and neutrality in general.\n\nSurprisingly, a recent poll showed that 53% of the Swiss were in favor of joining NATO, an unexpected number in a country where neutrality is included in the Constitution and strong state sovereignty is embedded in its national culture.\n\nThe Swiss pride themselves on their independence. Austria is also a neutral country militarily, but it joined the United Nations in 1955, forty-seven years earlier than Switzerland. Austria is a member of the European Union whereas since 1992 Switzerland has had protracted negotiations over its relations with the European Union. Swiss neutrality and sovereignty are as much a part of the national heritage as the Matterhorn and Geneva's Jet d'eau.\n\nTraditionally, the Swiss population has been more reluctant to join international institutions than the government. That is what makes the latest poll so unexpected. Based on the poll, the Swiss are more worried about being attacked by Russia than their historic neutrality.\n\nThe shift in Switzerland's attitude towards NATO has been swift. A Swiss security expert said in 2022: \"Switzerland is not interested in NATO membership; we simply don't need it. Not only is there no reason for us to join, membership would even be a disadvantage: we would lose our neutrality.\"\n\nA small country surrounded by three large neighbors, Switzerland has always boasted that it has the oldest military neutrality in the world. Officially, the 1815 Congress of Vienna established its neutrality at the end of the Napoleonic Wars. The 1907 Hague Convention further established that Switzerland would not take part in international armed conflicts, favor warring parties with troops or armaments, or make its territory available to the warring sides.\n\nSwitzerland has benefitted from its neutrality by having so many organizations, specialized U.N. agencies, and international civil servants in Geneva going back to the League of Nations. It prides itself on how its good offices represent the United States in Iran among several other mandates.\n\nAlthough politically and militarily neutral, Switzerland does have a history as a spy center. With 180 diplomatic Missions, over forty international organizations and 750 NGOs, Geneva has been and continues to be a hub for espionage. The U.S. and Switzerland, the so-called Sister Republics, quietly cooperated during World War II and the Cold War. The Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the forerunner of the CIA, functioned out of Bern with the arrival of Allen Dulles, officially the Special Assistant to the American Minister, in 1942. Dulles became director of the CIA in 1953. No undercover activities have called into question Swiss neutrality. They didn't historically, they don't now.\n\nBut there is a difference between spying cooperation and military alliance membership. Switzerland has been a member of NATO's antechamber Partnership for Peace (PfP) since 1996. Under the PfP, Switzerland's cooperation with NATO includes \"general goals such as the continuation of political dialogue and, more specifically, the development of cooperation in the fields of new technologies and innovation, resilience, the promotion of women, peace and security (WPS), disarmament and non-proliferation, and cyber defence. Many of these goals are aimed at enhancing interoperability, for example between air forces and communication systems.\"\n\nSwiss neutrality has been particularly challenged since the fall of the Berlin Wall. 1) Switzerland joined the U.N. in 2002 with a majority vote of 54.6% and twelve out of twenty-three cantons voting in favor. Sixteen years before, in 1986, 75% of the Swiss population voted not to join the U.N. 2) Switzerland continues to ban the re-export of Swiss-made guns and ammunition to Ukraine, but in 2023 it did sell twenty-five decommissioned Leopard 2 tanks to Germany on the condition that Berlin not forward the tanks to Ukraine. 3) Switzerland now sits on the U.N. Security Council (UNSC) as a non-permanent member. To calm objections to conflicts between UNSC membership and neutrality, a 2015 Federal Council report stated that \"The Security Council is not a party to a conflict in the sense of neutrality law...In today's polarised environment, neutrality is an advantage, not an obstacle.\"\n\nThe Swiss neutral image is changing, Often accused of being Western-leaning, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has highlighted this reality. The Swiss defense minister, Viola Amherd, visited NATO Headquarters in March 2023. During her visit, she participated in a North Atlantic Council meeting, a historic first for a Swiss defense minister. Swiss/U.S. military cooperation has also further deepened with the Swiss decision to purchase American F-25 fighter jets to replace its aging fleet.\n\nThere have been domestic and foreign reactions to these neutrality challenges and changes. The right-wing Swiss People's Party launched a \"neutrality initiative\" in 2022 to prohibit Switzerland from entering into military alliances or placing sanctions on other countries. A Russian foreign ministry spokesperson declared that \"Switzerland had unfortunately lost its status of a neutral state\" when Switzerland joined EU sanctions against Russia. Moreover, whereas Switzerland has represented Russia in Georgia and Georgia in Russia, Russia refused Switzerland's proposal for representing Ukraine's interest in Russia because \"Bern has joined illegal Western sanctions against Russia.\"\n\nAll the above are why the NATO liaison office's presence is so intriguing. Since there is no longer the Warsaw Pact - Have you ever wondered why NATO didn't disband when the Berlin Wall came down and the Warsaw Pact disbanded? - NATO's raison d'\u00eatre is now clearly opposing Russia. Its Article 5 represents the core principle that an attack on one of its members is an attack on all its members. If the NATO office move indicates that Switzerland is moving closer to NATO, Switzerland will be moving closer to a European, Transatlantic partnership and closer to Article 5 guarantees, and further away from its neutrality.\n\nThe concept of neutrally, both militarily and legally, has lost its glimmer in the face of Russia's aggression. Globally, there are expanding alliances and new partnerships in reaction to a rapidly changing security environment. Countries are shopping for new comparative advantages. NATO's move to Geneva may not be an existential threat to historic Swiss neutrality, but it is part of an evolving understanding of neutrality. The move, however small, can be interpreted as a direct consequence of Russia's invasion of Ukraine as well as the potential political significance of International Geneva.\n\nFrom https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/04/12/nato-comes-to-switzerland-goodbye-neutrality/",

        "title": "A Class Analysis of the Trump-Biden Rerun - Russia News Now",
        "text": "By \"class system\" we mean the basic workplace organizations -- the human relationships or \"social relations\" -- that accomplish the production and distribution of goods and services. Some examples include the master/slave, communal village, and lord/serf organizations. Another example, the distinctive capitalist class system, entails the employer/employee organization. In the United States and in much of the world, it is now the dominant class system. Employers -- a tiny minority of the population -- direct and control the enterprises and employees that produce and distribute goods and services. Employers buy the labor power of employees -- the population's vast majority -- and set it to work in their enterprises. Each enterprise's output belongs to its employer who decides whether to sell it, sets the price, and receives and distributes the resulting revenue.\n\nIn the United States, the employee class is badly split ideologically and politically. Most employees have probably stayed connected -- with declining enthusiasm or commitment -- to the Democratic Party. A sizable and growing minority within the class has some hope in Trump. Many have lost interest and participated less in electoral politics. Perhaps the most splintered are various \"progressive\" or \"left\" employees: some in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, some in various socialist, Green, independent, and related small parties, and some even drawn hesitatingly to Trump. Left-leaning employees were perhaps more likely to join and activate social movements (ecological, anti-racist, anti-sexist, and anti-war) rather than electoral campaigns.\n\nThe U.S. employee class broadly feels victimized by the last half-century's neoliberal globalization. Waves of manufacturing (and also service) job exports, coupled with waves of automation (computers, robots, and now artificial intelligence), have mostly brought that class bad news. Loss of jobs, income, and job security, diminished future work prospects, and reduced social standing are chief among them. In contrast, the extraordinary profits that drove employers' export and technology decisions accrued to them. Resulting redistributions of wealth and income likewise favored employers. Employees increasingly watched and felt a parallel social redistribution of political power and cultural riches moving beyond their reach.\n\nEmployees' class feelings were well grounded in U.S. history. The post-1945 development of U.S. capitalism smashed the extraordinary employee class unity that had been formed during the Great Depression of the 1930s. After the 1929 economic crash and the 1932 election, a reform-minded \"New Deal\" coalition of labor union leaders and strong socialist and communist parties gathered supportively around the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration that governed until 1945. That coalition won huge, historically unprecedented gains for the employee class including Social Security, unemployment compensation, the first federal minimum wage, and a large public jobs program. It built an immense following for the Democratic Party in the employee class.\n\nAs World War II ended in 1945, every other major capitalist economy (the UK, Germany, Japan, France, and Russia) was badly damaged. In sharp contrast, the war had strengthened U.S. capitalism. It reconstructed global capitalism and centered it around U.S. exports, capital investments, and the dollar as world currency. A new, distinctly American empire emerged, stressing informal imperialism, or \"neo-colonialism,\" against the formal, older imperialisms of Europe and Japan. The United States secured its new empire with an unprecedented global military program and presence. Private investment plus government spending on both the military and popular public services marked a transition from the Depression and war (with its rationing of consumer goods) to a dramatically different relative prosperity from the later 1940s to the 1970s.\n\nCold War ideology clothed post-1945 policies at home and abroad. Thus the government's mission globally was to spread democracy and defeat godless socialism. That mission justified both increasingly heavy military spending and McCarthyism's effective destruction of socialist, communist, and labor organizations. The Cold War atmosphere facilitated undoing and then reversing the Great Depression's leftward surge of U.S. politics. Purging the left within unions plus the relentless demonization of left parties and social movements as foreign-based communist projects split the New Deal coalition. It separated left organizations from social movements and both of them from the employee class as a whole.\n\nDespite many employees staying loyal to the Democratic Party (even as they disconnected from the persecuted left components of the New Deal), the Cold War pushed all U.S. politics rightward. The Republican Party cashed in by being aggressively pro-Cold War and raising funds from employers determined to undo the New Deal. The Democratic Party leadership reduced its former reliance on weakening unions and the demoralized, deactivated remnants of the New Deal coalition. Instead that leadership sought funds from the same corporate rich that the Republicans tapped. The predictable results included the failure of the Democratic Party to reverse the rightward shift of U.S. politics. The Dems likewise abandoned most efforts to build on the achievements of the New Deal or move further toward social democracy. They increasingly failed even to protect what the New Deal had achieved. These developments deepened the alienation of many workers from the Democratic Party or political engagement altogether. A vicious downward cycle, with occasional temporary upsurge moments, took over \"progressive\" politics.\n\nThat vicious cycle entrapped especially older, white males. Among employees, they had gained the most from the 1945-1975 prosperity. However, after the 1970s, employers' profit-driven automation and their decisions to relocate production abroad seriously undermined their employees' jobs and incomes, especially in manufacturing. This part of the employee class eventually turned against \"the system\" -- against the prevailing economic tide. They mourned a disappearing prosperity. At first, they turned right politically. The Cold War had isolated and undermined the left-wing institutions and culture that might otherwise have attracted anti-system employees. Left-leaning mobilizations against the system as a wholewere rare (unlike more single-issue mobilizations around issues like gender, race, and ecology). Neither unions nor other organizations had the social support needed to organize them. Or they simply feared to try. Even more recently the rising labor and union militancy has so far only secondarily and marginally raised themes of systematic anti-capitalism.\n\nRepublican politicians and media personalities seized the opportunity to transform the disappearing post-1970s prosperity into an idealized American past. They carefully avoided blaming that disappearance on profit-driven capitalism. They blamed Democrats and \"liberals\" whose social welfare programs cost too much. Excessive taxes were wasted, they insisted, on ineffective social programs for \"others\" (the non-white and non-male). If only those others worked as hard and as productively as white males did, Republicans repeated, they would have enjoyed the same prosperity instead of seeking a \"free ride from the government.\" Portions of the employee class persuaded by such reasoning switched from Democrat to Republican and then often responded to Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" (MAGA) mantra. Their switch stimulated Republican politicians to imagine a possible new mass base much broader than their existing mix of religious fundamentalists, gun lovers, and white supremacists. Leading Republicans glimpsed political possibilities unavailable since the Great Depression of the 1930s had turned U.S. politics leftward toward social democracy.\n\nEmerging from within or around the Republican Party, the new 21st-century far Right revived classic U.S. isolationist patriotism around America First slogans. They combined that with a loosely libertarian blaming of all social ills on the inherent evil of government. By carefully directing neither criticism nor blame toward the capitalist economic system, Republicans secured the usual support (financial, political, journalistic) from the employer class. That included employers who had never prospered much from the neoliberal globalization turn, those who saw bigger, better opportunities from an economic nationalist/protectionist turn, and all those long focused on the employer-driven project of undoing the New Deal politically, culturally, and economically. These various elements increasingly gathered around Trump.\n\nThey opposed immigration, often via hysterical statements and mobilizations against \"invasions\" fantasized as threatening America. They defined government spending on immigrants (using native and \"hard-working\" Americans' taxes) as wasted on unmeritorious \"others.\" Trump championed their views and reinforced parallel scapegoating of Black and Brown citizens and women as unworthy beneficiaries of government supports exchanged for their voting Democratic. Some Republicans increasingly embraced conspiracy theories (QAnon and others) to explain diverse plots aimed at dethroning white Christianity from dominating American society. MAGA and America First are slogans that articulate resentment, bitterness, and protest at perceived victimization. Repurposing Cold War imagery, Trumpers synonymously targeted liberals, Democrats, Marxists, socialists, labor unions, and others seen as close allies plotting to \"replace\" white Christians. Trump referred to them publicly as \"vermin\" that he would defeat/destroy once he became President again.\n\nThe larger part of the U.S. employee class has not (yet) been won over by the Republicans. It has stayed, so far, with the Democrats. Yet aggravated social divisiveness has settled everywhere into U.S. culture and politics. It frightens many who stay within the Democratic Party, seeing it as the lesser evil despite its \"centrist\" leaders and their corporate donors. The latter include especially the financial and hi-tech megacorporations that profitably led the post-1975 neoliberal globalization period. The centrist leadership studiously avoided offending its corporate patrons while using a modified Keynesian fiscal policy to achieve two objectives. The first was support for government programs that helped solidify an electoral base increasingly among women, and Black and brown citizens. The second was support for aggressively projecting U.S. military and political power around the world.\n\nThe U.S. empire protected by that policy proved especially profitable for the financial and hi-tech circles of the United States' biggest businesses. At the same time, another part of the U.S. employee class also began to turn against the system, but it found the new Right unacceptable and \"centrism\" only slightly less so. The Democratic party has so far retained most of these people although many have increasingly moved toward \"progressive\" champions such as Bernie Sanders, Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, and Cori Bush. Cornel West and Jill Stein carry similar banners into this year's election but they insist on doing that from outside the Democratic Party.\n\nHostility has intensified between the two major parties as their opposition has become more extreme. This keeps happening because neither found nor implemented any solutions to the deepening problems besetting the United States. Ever more extreme wealth and income inequalities undermine what remains of a sense of community binding Americans. Politics ever more controlled by the employer class and especially the super-rich produce widespread debilitating anger, resignation, and rage. The relatively shrinking power of the United States abroad drives home a sense of impending doom. The rise of the first real economic superpower competitor (China) raises the specter of the U.S. global unipolar moment being replaced, and soon.\n\nEach major party blames the other for everything going wrong. Both also respond to the declining empire by moving rightward toward alternative versions of economic nationalism -- \"America First\" -- in place of the cheerleading for neoliberal globalization that both parties indulged in before. Republicans carefully refuse to blame capitalism or capitalists for anything. Instead, they blame bad government, the Democrats, the liberals, and China. Democrats likewise carefully refuse to blame capitalism or capitalists for anything (except the \"progressives,\" who do that moderately). Democrats mostly blame Republicans who have \"gone crazy\" and \"threaten democracy.\" They erect new versions of their old demons. Russia and Putin stand in for the USSR and Stalin as chief awful foreigners with Chinese \"communists\" a close second. Trying to hold on to the political middle, the Democrats denounce Republicans and especially the Trump/MAGA people for challenging the last 70 years of political consensus. In that Democratic Party version of the \"good old days,\" reasonable Republicans and Democrats then alternated in power dutifully. The result was that the U.S. empire and U.S. capitalism prospered first by helping to end the exhausted European empires and then by profiting from the United States' unipolar global hegemony.\n\nBiden's plans pretend the U.S. empire is not in decline. In 2024, he offers more of the old establishment politics. Trump basically pretends the same about the U.S. empire but carefully selects problem areas (e.g., immigration, Chinese competition, and Ukraine) that he can represent as failures of Democratic leadership. Nothing fundamental is amiss with the U.S. empire and its prospects in his eyes. All that is necessary is to reject Biden and his politics as incapable of reviving it. Trump's plans thus call for a much more extreme economic nationalism run by a leaner, meaner government.\n\nEach side deepens the split between Republicans and Democrats. Neither dares admit the basic, long-term declining empire and the key problems (income and wealth inequality, politics corrupted by that inequality, worsening business cycles, and mammoth debts) accumulated by its capitalist foundation. The parties' jousting turns on substitute issues that offer temporary electoral advantages. It also reinforces the public's incapacity for systemic critique and change. Both parties endlessly appeal to a population whose alienation deepens as relentless systemic decline worms its way into everyone's daily life and troubles. Both parties increasingly expose their growing irrelevance.\n\nNeither party's campaign offers solutions to systemic decline. Gross miscalculations of a changed world economy and shrinking U.S. political power abroad underlay both parties' failed policies in relation to Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine, and Gaza. The turn toward economic nationalism and protectionism will not stop the decline. Something bigger and deeper than either Party dares consider is underway. Capitalism has moved its dynamic centers yet again over the last generation. This time the move went from western Europe, North America, and Japan to China, India, and beyond, from the G7 to BRICS. Wealth and power are correspondingly shifting.\n\nThe places capitalism leaves behind descend into mass depression, overdose deaths, and sharpening social divisions. These social crises keep worsening alongside deepening inequalities of wealth, income, and education. Steadily if also maddeningly slowly, the rightward shift of U.S. politics after 1945 has finally arrived at social exhaustion and ineffectuality. Perhaps thereby the United States prepares another possible New Deal with or without another 1929-style crash.\n\nHopefully, then, one crucial lesson of the New Deal will have been learned and applied. Leaving the capitalist class structure of production unchanged -- a minority of employers dominating a majority of employees -- enables that minority to undo whatever reforms any New Deal might achieve. That is what the U.S. employer class did after 1945. The solution now must include moving beyond the employer-employee organization of the workplace. Replacing that with a democratic community organization -- what we elsewhere call worker cooperatives -- is the missing element that can make progressive reforms stick. When employees and employers are the same people, no longer will a separate employer class have the incentive and resources to undo what the employee majority wants. Replacing employer/employee-organized workplaces with worker coops is the very different \"great replacement\" we need. On the basis of reforms secured in that way, we can build a future. We can avoid repeating the last half-century's failure even to preserve the reforms imposed on a capitalism that crashed and burned in the 1930s.\n\nThis article was produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute.\n\nFrom https://www.counterpunch.org/2024/04/12/a-class-analysis-of-the-trump-biden-rerun/",

        "title": "How Turkish Sanctions Against Israel Will Impact Bilateral Trade - Russia News Now",
        "text": "Turkey's decision to halt the export of 54 products to Israel in response to its war on Gaza isn't likely to have far-reaching results, since both countries' economies are complementary in nature rather than central to each other.\n\nThe Turkish trade ministry announced earlier this week that Ankara would continue to implement the restrictions as long as Israel denies uninterrupted flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza Strip, citing UN Security Council decisions and an International Court of Justice (ICJ) preliminary judgment against Israel's conduct in the coastal enclave. The export restrictions encompass items such as aluminium wire, steel, cement, construction materials, granite, chemicals, pesticides, engine oils, jet fuel and bricks.\n\nBefore the war, Turkish-Israeli ties had been steadier than they had been for years. After years of tensions over Palestine, the two normalized relations in 2022. Yet, while Turkey and Israel quarreled over the past decade, and even stopped cooperating with each other, trade had never been interrupted. In fact, it flourished over time.\n\nThe Turkish public has been outraged at Israel's actions in Gaza, where reportedly more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in six months. Lists of ships carrying goods to Israel circulated on social media as Israel's onslaught grew. People also highlighted companies close to the Turkish government that continued commercial relations with Israel during the war.\n\nEven though there is no evidence to back claims that Turkey sold weapons to Israel, the controversy was stoked by a small quantity of hunting gear or hunting equipment parts being found among the exports. They were broadly classified by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK) as \"weaponry\".\n\nIn response to this domestic pressure and serious setbacks for the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in local elections last month, the government decided to act against Israel.\n\nTies have been cut on the Israeli side, too. In October, several Israeli supermarket chains halted imports from Turkey in response to Ankara's critical stance on the Gaza war. Israeli food company Strauss in December changed the packaging for one of its most well-known products, Elite Turkish coffee, adding an Israeli flag and patriotic slogans.\n\nAn important market\n\nBut is the trade between the two countries vital? Many say no, but Israel is nonetheless an important export market for Ankara. Turkey's exports to Israel were worth $5.4bn in 2023, or 2.1 percent of its total exports, according to official data.\n\nAlthough bilateral trade has dropped by 33 percent since the October 7 Hamas-led attack, it has nonetheless continued and exports to Israel have increased each month in 2024 so far. Both countries have had a free trade deal in place since 1996 and there have been no tariffs on certain products since 2000, which has enabled major increases in bilateral trade, largely favouring Turkey.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2023, trade between the two countries nearly tripled. By the end of that period, Turkey had become the fifth-largest supplier of imported goods to Israel, while Israel ranked as Turkey's tenth-largest export market, based on data from the Central Bureau of Statistics.\n\nTurkey exported steel, automotive industry products, chemicals, ready-made clothing and apparel, electricity and electronics, cement, glass, ceramics and soil products, furniture, paper, and forestry to Israel, according to a report published by the Turkey Exporters Assembly covering the period between 2011 and 2020.\n\n\"The economies are complementary but not intertwined,\" Gallia Lindenstrauss, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), told Middle East Eye. \"Turkey can find also substitutes to what it imports from Israel, and anyhow, of the bilateral trade, three-quarters are Turkish exports to Israel and only one-quarter is Israeli exports to Turkey.\"\n\nTrade with Israel has traditionally been highly advantageous for Turkey, which enjoyed a trade surplus of $3.9bn last year. Israel serves as a significant market for Turkish steel, purchasing 726,000 tonnes last year. This figure constitutes over 20 percent of Turkey's total steel exports. The ban is expected to significantly affect these exports.\n\nIn terms of dependence on imports, Israel heavily relies on Turkish cement, with imports from Turkey making up 29 percent of Israel's total cement imports last year. Additionally, Turkish imports represent about 11 percent of Israel's total plastic and rubber products, and around 10 percent in textiles.\n\nSources familiar with the construction industry told Israeli news outlet Mako that the new restrictions were expected to increase the prices of apartments and rent in the country if they are implemented. \"In terms of long-term repercussions, the fact the Turkey halts construction materials when these are needed to repair damaged houses in the south and north of Israel because of rockets and other damage will likely taint relations also in the future,\" Lindenstrauss said.\n\n\"Also, while anyhow there were question marks regarding a possible gas pipeline between Israel and Turkey, these export restrictions in a time of war will be a big warning sign not to proceed with the pipeline idea.\"\n\nImpact on Palestine\n\nTurkey's decision to restrict exports to Israel likely has an impact on Palestine as well. \"Israel has complete control over the border crossings as Palestinian imports arrive at Haifa or Ashdod seaports, and the goods are then transported to Palestinian territories via trucks,\" Rashad Yousef, director of policies and planning at the Palestinian Ministry of National Economy, told Anadolu Agency.\n\nYousef added that Palestinian-Turkish trade volume in 2022 exceeded $900m, representing a 12 percent increase over 2021. He also said that the main Turkish exports to Palestine are iron, wood, vegetable oil, tobacco, food products and items from the plastic industries.\n\n\"If we exclude Israel, Turkiye is the largest source of goods and products in the Palestinian market,\" Yousef said. However, there are ways to continue to trade with Israel by rerouting trade through third countries, as the Ukraine war has proved following western sanctions on Russia.\n\nIsraeli importers are mulling bringing in Turkish goods via Slovenian ports Koper or Ljubljana, according to an Israeli report. \"But still, the economic relations were what kept the relations going even in times of political crisis, so it is regrettable we have reached this point,\" adds Lindenstrauss.\n\n\"And despite it having been a painful step, I don't see it in itself changing Israel's policy - the pressures from the White House are much more significant.\"",

        "text": "A US carrier strike group led by the USS Theodore Roosevelt has held a three-day joint exercise with its allies Japan and South Korea as US President Joe Biden met for talks with leaders from Japan and the Philippines at the White House. The dueling military and diplomatic maneuvers are meant to strengthen the partners' solidarity in the face of China's aggressive military actions in the region.\n\nA number of US and South Korean guided missile destroyers and a Japanese warship joined the April 10-12 drill in the disputed East China Sea, where worries about China territorial claims are rising. The Associated Press was one of several news organizations allowed a front-row look at the drills.\n\nRear Adm. Christopher Alexander, commander of Carrier Strike Group Nine, said the three nations conducted undersea warfare exercises, maritime interdiction operations, search and rescue drills and work focused on communication and data sharing. He told journalists Thursday on the Roosevelt that these drills would help improve communication among the United States and its allies and \"better prepare us for a crisis in the region.\"\n\nF/A-18E Super Hornet combat jets took off from the carrier's flight deck, which also had anti-submarine MH-60R Seahawk helicopters. Journalists were flown more than an hour from Kadena Air Base, the hub of US Pacific air power. Kadena is on Japan's southern island of Okinawa, which is home to about half of the 50,000 American troops stationed in Japan.\n\n\"It is a busy time; there is a lot going on in the world,\" Alexander said. \"The significance of this exercise is we have three like-minded countries, three like-minded navies that believe in peace, security and stability in the western Pacific.\"\n\nThe participation of Japan and South Korea was another sign of improving ties between the sometimes wary neighbors. The two US allies' relationship has often been strained by the memory of Japan's half-century colonization of the Korean Peninsula. Washington has been pressing them to cooperate so the three partners can better deal with threats from China and North Korea.\n\nThis week's huge parliamentary election defeat of the governing party of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has sought better relations with Japan, could constrain his Japan-friendly efforts, but experts believe ties will remain stable.\n\nThe latest naval exercise is part of Biden's work to deepen security and diplomatic engagement with Indo-Pacific nations. Biden invited Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos to the White House for their first trilateral talks Thursday, and has declared that the US defense commitment to the Pacific allies is \"ironclad.\"\n\nTensions between China and the Philippines have risen over repeated clashes by the two nations' coast guard vessels in the disputed South China Sea. Chinese coast guard ships also regularly approach disputed Japanese-controlled East China Sea islands near Taiwan.\n\nBeijing has defended its operations in the South China Sea and blamed the United States for creating tensions. China's President Xi Jinping had a series of talks this week with senior officials from Vietnam, Russia and Taiwan.\n\nThe US-Japan-South Korea naval exercises follow four-way drills held in the South China Sea, where Japan joined the United States, Australia and the Philippines. Participants carefully avoided mentioning China and said they were holding the exercises to safeguard a peaceful and stable Indo-Pacific.\n\nAn area of long-simmering disputes, the South China Sea serves a key sea lane for global trade. Concerned governments include Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Taiwan.",

        "text": "Ukraine is trying to hurt Russia by hitting its refineries. But the attacks fail to have the desired effects on Russia. The Russian response though, in form of de-energization attacks on Ukraine, seriously endanger the state.\n\nToday the Russian Federation continued with the de-energization of Ukraine (machine translation):\n\nAs a result of a massive Russian missile attack on the night of April 11 , the Trypillya thermal power plant in the Kiev region was completely destroyed.\n\n...\n\nLocated in the city of Ukrainka, Trypillia thermal power station was commissioned in 1973 and became the most powerful power plant in the Kiev region. It was also the largest supplier of electricity to the Kiev, Cherkasy and Zhytomyr regions.\n\nSince the Zmiyevskaya TPP in the Kharkiv region was completely destroyed on March 22, and Russian troops occupied the Uglegorsk TPP in the Donetsk region on July 25, 2022, Centrenergo has now lost 100% of its generation.\n\nAfter the complete destruction of the Trypillya TPP, the network recalls the statement of Centrenergo from August 2023 that the facility is equipped with physical protection \"at 100%\".\n\nAt the same time, it was reported that 70% of the work at the Zmievskaya TPP was completed. This facility was also destroyed by shelling in March of this year.\n\nDTEK, another power supply company in Ukraine, also reported significant losses:\n\nDuring the missile attack on early 11 April, Russia attacked two thermal power plants owned by DTEK company (Ukraine's largest private investor in energy), severely damaging the equipment there.\n\nSource: DTEK press service\n\nDetails: \"After the attack, the power engineers promptly began to eliminate the consequences and restore the equipment. According to early reports, there were no casualties,\" the statement said.\n\nSince the start of the full-scale invasion, DTEK's thermal power plants have been attacked almost 170 times.\n\nIn addition to the power supplies Russian attacks also targeted parts of the national electricity distribution network:\n\nRussia has damaged Ukrenergo's substations and generation facilities in Odesa, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv, Kharkiv and Kyiv Oblasts as a result of a massive missile attack on the night of 10-11 April (Ukrenergo is the electricity transmission system operator in Ukraine).\n\nEurope's biggest underground storage facility for natural gas in western Ukraine was also attacked (machine translation):\n\nOn the night of April 11, Russian cruise missiles of various classes and drones attacked two critical energy infrastructure facilities in the Lviv region.\n\nThis was announced by the head of the Lviv OVA Maxim Kozitsky.\n\n\"This is a gas distribution infrastructure facility in the Stryi district and an electric substation in the Chervonograd district. Fires started. They were quickly extinguished by firefighters. There were no casualties. All life support systems in the Lviv region are operating normally,\" Kozytsky said.\n\nThe underground storage facility is partly used by west European companies. But without the pumping and distribution system at the surface the underground facility, and anything stored in it, becomes useless.\n\nRussia has not attacked any of the nuclear power plants in Ukraine. They, and limited electricity imports from western Europe, can still provide a minimum of basic load electricity to the country. But any peaks in consumption, which are usually buffered by the now destroyed thermal and hydroelectric power plants, will put the system under stress. Significant blackouts will thus become unavoidable.\n\nAleksey Arestovich, a former advisor to the president of Ukraine, is not happy about this (machine translation):\n\nThe Russians consistently knock out our generation - hydroelectric and thermal power plants.\n\nMore than UAH 50 billion was allocated to protect the stations.\n\nThis is the same amount as according to the NBU, Ukrainians collected defense donations in two years.\n\nI throw up questions that should be asked to our leaders.:\n\nEnergy is the foundation of the country's life. If there is no energy, there is nothing.\n\nWe are still holding on, thanks to the energy bridge with the EU and nuclear power plants, but the prospect that some regions will sit without electricity for weeks (and therefore without production and storage of food-in the summer!) getting closer.\n\nNeither Arestovich nor other commentators in Ukraine acknowledge that the Russian campaign to de-energize the country is a direct consequence of Ukrainian attacks on infrastructure in Russia.\n\nThe daily reports by the Russian Ministry of Defense have emphasized this several times:\n\nIn response to the Kiev regime's attempts to damage Russian oil and gas and energy facilities, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation launched a massive strike on Ukrainian fuel and energy facilities with long-range precision weapons, air-and sea-based weapons, as well as unmanned aerial vehicles. The strike goals have been achieved. All objects are hit.\n\nAs a result, the work of Ukrainian military industry enterprises was disrupted, the transfer of reserves to combat areas was disrupted, and fuel supply to units and military units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was hampered.\n\nUkraine has, over several weeks, used drones to attack oil refineries deep within Russia. It did not stop even after it received the first Russian responses in form of renewed strikes on its energy facilities.\n\nThe U.S. has said that it does not like the Ukrainian strikes on Russian oil facilities because they could lead to an increase in global gasoline prices which could lower president Biden's chance for a re-election.\n\nOnly yesterday U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin again criticized such attacks:\n\nUS Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Ukraine's recent drone strikes on Russian oil refineries have a \"knock-on effect\" that could affect the global energy situation and suggested Kyiv focus on \"tactical and operational targets\" instead.\n\n\"Those attacks could have a knock-on effect in terms of the global energy situation. Ukraine is better served in going after tactical and operational targets that can directly influence the current fight,\" Austin told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, April 9, Bloomberg reported.\n\n...\n\nAustin's comments are the latest confirmation of Washington's position on Ukrainian drone strikes on Russian refineries, which first started circulating following a Financial Times (FT) article - citing unnamed officials - that said Washington had relayed wishes to Ukraine's intelligence units to stop hitting Russian oil refineries for fear of rising crude prices and retaliation.\n\nHowever, unable to provide further money and weapons to Ukraine, the Biden administration has lost much of its leverage over Ukraine.\n\nIt has also failed to put its ducks in a row. Remarkably the General Secretary of NATO, usually a spokesperson for U.S. policy, takes a position that is in opposite to what the U.S. Secretary of Defense says:\n\nOil refineries in Russian territory are \"legitimate\" targets for Ukrainian drone strikes, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg during a joint press briefing with Finnish President Alexander Stubb on April 10.\n\nStoltenberg reiterated that Ukraine has the right to defend itself by military means.\n\n\"Ukraine has the right to strike legitimate military targets outside the territory of their country to defend itself,\" the secretary said.\n\nWhile the Economist lauds the Ukrainian attacks it notes that the intended consequences like a gasoline shortage in Russia, are unlikely to happen:\n\nThe government has kept a lid on prices by banning petrol exports for six months from March 1st, and striking a deal with Belarus, its client state. Russia imported 3,000 tonnes of fuel from Belarus in the first half of March, up from zero in January. Fearing that may not be enough, officials have also asked neighbouring Kazakhstan to set aside a third of its reserves, equivalent to 100,000 tonnes, should Russia need them, according to Reuters.\n\nNor will Russia lose any income:\n\nThe government will even save some cash by paying out fewer per-barrel subsidies to refineries. Russia's biggest money-earners are resource taxes. And because these are levied as royalties at the well-head, the government is indifferent between oil exported as crude or as refined fuel, says Mr Vakulenko. As long as Russia is able to export crude, it can collect royalties.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nOne might think that the negative effects from the above are significant enough to lead to a change in policies.",

        "title": "Ending the Second Cold War - Russia News Now",
        "text": "It might seem premature to talk about ending the second cold war when it seems that it is barely underway. Just a few years ago, populations were celebrating the end of the first cold war. That era of animosity ended with dramatic suddenness. General Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, observed waggishly that with the collapse of the Soviet Union, \"I'm running out of demons. I'm running out of villains. I'm down to (Fidel) Castro and Kim Il Sung.\" However, that happy situation did not last long.\n\nA non-Communist Russia as the principal successor to the Soviet Union seemed eager for nothing so much as admission to the democratic capitalist West. Populations throughout the world may well wonder for years what might have happened if the United States and its allies had greeted that eagerness with receptivity instead of arrogant cynicism.\n\nHowever, Moscow did not encounter a welcoming embrace. Instead, Russia's leaders and people were greeted with callousness by their Western counterparts. By the end of the 1990's, visible tensions involving the Western mistreatment of Russia's longstanding Serbian clients were already beginning to emerge. Worse, the West intruded into Russia's core security zone by adding Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic to the Alliance. Instead of dramatically reducing the danger of an East-West war, the United States and its Allies had simply created a new arena farther east for such a confrontation. East-West relations have deteriorated even more since then to the point that we have a full-blown second cold war.\n\nIt is not too early to change course and seek to end the second cold war as rapidly as the first. The main difference is that this time the United States and the Western powers are primarily responsible for generating the hostile relations and most of the concessions will have to come from the West. The United States and the West is the faction intruding into Russia's core security zone, not the other way around. The Ukraine war highlighted the arrogance or ineptitude of the Western powers. Repairing the damage will take a major sustained effort and it is never too soon to start.\n\nRelations were rapidly breaking down even before the onset of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Relations across the board virtually collapsed once that episode took place. Russia was the provocateur in the narrow military sense since it launched the invasion of Ukraine's territory but the Western powers were responsible for most of the subsequent provocations.\n\nFor example, the European Union was very quick to impose a wide array of sanctions in retaliation for Russia's military move. Many of the penalties had little or nothing to do with the actions of Vladimir Putin's government or had any military relevance. For example, one of the principal victims of the economic retaliations from the West were the various cruise lines. Western tourists who looked forward to their vacations in Russia suddenly discovered that the scheduled stops in St. Petersburg and other crucial sites were wiped off the map. One can only ponder how penalizing middle-aged shop owners in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities would have a meaningful impact on the decision making of Vladimir Putin and his inner circle. Instead, the targets appeared to be innocent civilians who had no meaningful influence over the decisions of the Russian government.\n\nInnocent shopkeepers were not the only victims of the West's retaliation. The next most prominent target were ordinary civilians around the world who now had to live in a far more dangerous world. In addition to penalizing innocent civilians, the NATO powers retaliated to Russia's aggression against Ukraine by making it clear that crucial arms control agreements would no longer remain in effect. The first casualty was the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces Agreement (INF). Allowing that agreement to expire made it much more likely that tensions in Europe would soar. Washington's decision to let the Open Sky's Agreement expire made that outcome even more likely.\n\nThe breakdown of the original Cold War Nuclear Arms System began to unravel two years ago. Matters have grown steadily worse. U.S. and Russian nuclear missiles are now, once again, on hair-trigger alert, something that had ended with the original Cold War. There are now even doubts about the viability of the ban on testing nuclear weapons. Both Russia and the United States had signed the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty years ago, but the United States had never ratified it. In November 2023, Russia rescinded its ratification; a truly alarming development. The first step in ending the Second Cold War must be rebuilding the nuclear arms control system. That should have top priority if there is to be meaningful progress in repairing the relationship between the United States and Russia. Once the nuclear arms control regime is restored, only then can progress be made on rebuilding the economic and political relationship between the United States and Russia. Otherwise, much of the hostility and tension in relations between NATO and Russia will remain.\n\nWe should not want another period of multiple decades marked by hostility and a lack of normal economic relations. Let's see if the current generation of policymakers can be wiser than their predecessors.",

        "title": "Europe Reclaims Control of Its Energy Destiny",
        "text": "Ursula von der Leyen is President of the European Commission. Fatih Birol is Executive Director of the International Energy Agency.\n\nSpring has come, Winter has gone. Like last winter, Europe moved out of its second winter since Russia's invasion of Ukraine without energy shortages, blackouts, cold homes or supply cuts. Quite the opposite, Europe ended winter with a remarkable milestone for its energy sector: EU storages were almost 60% full, a record amount.\n\nThis didn't grab the headlines, but it matters. Because it shows that Europe has finally loosened the grip that Russia had over its energy sector. Europe has taken its energy destiny back into its own hands.\n\nLet us explain how. Cast your minds back to 2021, well before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Already then, Russia was failing to fill gas storages to their usual levels in advance of winter. This was a clear attempt to play on our gas dependence, to increase Russia's leverage.\n\nThen came the invasion of Ukraine. And President Putin decided that, faced with European solidarity, he would use this leverage against us, against Europe, by cutting gas supplies and using high fuel prices as his weapon.\n\nWe all carry the bruises from Putin's decisions. Europeans have struggled with the resulting pressures on the cost of living. And as gas storage levels ebbed and flowed, they became a barometer of our vulnerability, of our energy insecurity. But that barometer is now stable, trending in the right direction. Our choices were good ones. Europe has made real progress in improving the resilience of its energy system. Gas prices have come down sharply. Since the beginning of this year, they are consistently below \u20ac30 per megawatt hour.\n\nWhat did we do? Europe acted quickly and we acted together. We used the strengths of our single market. We could call on the strengths of our friends that provided us with alternative supplies. By now, the EU's main supplier of natural gas is Norway, a trusted ally.\n\nBut most importantly, we worked on a structural response to this crisis, by investing massively in renewable energy, by boosting energy efficiency. And the results speak for themselves. Two years ago - and these are figures from the International Energy Agency - one in five units of energy consumed in the European Union came from Russian fossil fuels. Today, it is one in twenty. We get more energy overall from renewables in the European Union than from Russia. Last year, in 2023, for the first time ever, we produced more electricity from wind than from gas.\n\nEurope is bringing down its consumption in line with our climate goals. But that doesn't mean we need to stop thinking about gas markets. Because we're now heading towards a different set of issues and challenges. A large wave of new LNG exports projects is coming to market in the second half of the decade, mostly from the United States and from Qatar. These projects are going to increase global supply of LNG by 50%. As a result, we're moving from a world of shortfalls of gas to the opposite, a world where we could soon see an abundance. This could bring significantly lower gas prices.\n\nAt the same time, the share of gas imports from Russia fell from 45% before the war in Ukraine to 15% last year. Gone are the days of Europe's dependency on Russia. With the cuts in Russian pipeline deliveries, LNG has now effectively become Europe's baseload source of gas supply. It will remain important for our energy costs and our energy security for some time to come, even as we build up a new clean energy economy.\n\nBut we also remain focused on the broader picture. We are in a climate emergency. In the economy of the future, competitiveness and sustainability must go hand in hand. Affordable prices for energy are a key factor. But cheaper gas does not relieve Europe and other major economies of the responsibility to reach net zero emissions as soon as possible, and to help other countries do the same. To do so, we need to tackle all sources of emissions, including emissions from gas.\n\nThat means insisting on near-zero methane emissions from the gas that we continue to use, whether produced here or imported. It means drastically scaling up renewables, renewable gases, energy efficiency, clean hydrogen and other clean energy technologies.\n\nIt also means working hand in hand with industry, and supporting it to build a business model fit for a decarbonized economy. That was the purpose of the Clean Transition Dialogues the Commission organized between November and last week.\n\nIn other words, while Europe came out stronger of the past winters, we also remain laser-focused on the lasting solutions to our energy dilemmas.\n\n/Public Release.

        "title": "US Should Adopt the Mearsheimer Plan - Russia News Now",
        "text": "During a recent panel discussion sponsored by the Neutrality Studies YouTube channel and The American Committee for US-Russia Accord, the distinguished political scientist John J. Mearsheimer proffered what at first glance might appear to be a radical solution to the crisis in Ukraine.\n\n\"I think what has to be done here,\" said Mearsheimer, \"is that we have to basically sever the West's security relationship with Ukraine. It is just not enough to say 'Ukraine will not become part of NATO.' We have to completely sever our security relationship with Ukraine so that the Russians feel somewhat secure that the West is not going to surreptitiously try and make Ukraine a de facto member of NATO.\"\n\n\"Second, we should push Ukraine immediately to start serious negotiations with the Russians, so that they end up only losing the territory that they have already lost.\"\n\n\"The great danger,\" he continued, \"is that if this war continues and we continue to threaten to bring Ukraine into NATO, what we are doing is giving the Russians a greater and greater incentive to take more of Ukraine and to make Ukraine more of a dysfunctional rump state so that if it ever did become a part of NATO, it would not be a serious threat to Russia. So what NATO should do right now is make it clear that Ukraine is not coming into NATO and that Ukraine is on its own to work out a security relationship with Russia.\"\n\nTo no one's surprise, NATO seems intent on pursuing the exact opposite of what Mearsheimer counsels. Only last week it was reported that NATO secretary-general, Jens Stoltenberg, is seeking to create a $100 billion fund to continue to arm Ukraine. Still more, the 'Mission to Ukraine' plan would grant NATO operational control over the Ramstein Group, the US-led consortium that oversees military supplies to Ukraine. Such a move, according to one unnamed diplomat who spoke to the Financial Times, said such a move would be \"crossing a Rubicon. Nato will have a role in coordinating lethal support to Ukraine.\"\n\nThough the general, albeit begrudging, consensus is that Ukraine is now badly losing the fight, the war seems to be entering an even more perilous phase, with Ukraine's plausible (though far from proven) involvement in the Crocus City Hall terror attack and its continuing series of attacks inside Russia and on Russian oil refineries.\n\nAs such, Mearsheimer's call to sever US security ties makes eminent sense - and indeed may be one of Ukraine's only hopes for a future in Europe.\n\nIndeed, one could argue that Ukraine has wasted a decade's worth of valuable time in the years following the 2014 Maidan coup. The subsequent Russian annexation of Crimea and the formation of the People's Republics of Luhansk and Donetsk might have been better seen as an opportunity for the country and its ethno-nationalist minded elites in the Western part of the country. Wiser heads in Washington and Brussels (if there were any) might have counseled Kiev that their interests would not be served in fighting a war over the overwhelmingly Russian part of the population in the eastern and southern regions of the country. After all, it was those regions that formed the core bloc of voters for the Party of Regions, a bloc that Kiev's western-backed elites had repeatedly tried, beginning with the Orange Revolution in 2004, to disenfranchise.\n\nThere was little guarantee a civil war would bring an end to the unrest sparked by the bloody coup that took place on the Maidan, much less reconciliation. There were, however, rather better odds it would bring ruin, and eventually, as did happen, the Russians. Ceding the disputed territories, abandoning NATO membership, working out a bilateral security treaty with the Kremlin and focusing on meeting the requirements to join the EU would have been the more sensible path.\n\nBut Kiev made the fatal mistake of listening to Washington and the neoconservative and liberal interventionists who run things and who prove, with each passing mid-adventure, the truth of Henry Kissinger's axiom that \"It may be dangerous to be America's enemy, but to be America's friend is fatal.\"\n\nJohn Mearsheimer is right, for Ukraine's sake, the Western-funded proxy war should end, and Ukraine should seek, on a strictly bilateral basis, a negotiated settlement with Moscow. An escalation of the war is in no one's interest, least of all Ukraine's.\n\nJames W.

        "title": "Martin Seiff: Diplomacy Matters - Russia News Now",
        "text": "Eminent economist Professor Jeffrery Sachs was for many years a senior adviser to two Secretary Generals of the United Nations: It is a national tragedy that President Joe Biden has not taken him into the White House in the same role.\n\nFor Sachs has just published another immensely important article: Entitled \"The Urgency of Diplomacy\", it points out that the United States, with its neutered eunuch European allies tamely in tow, has now long since abandoned all pretense at any kind of serious diplomacy, negotiations, dialogue or efforts to achieve and maintain mutual coexistence in the world with either Russia or China.\n\nAs usual, Sachs does not mince his words:\n\n\"There has been a complete collapse of diplomacy between the US and Russia, and a near-total collapse between the US and China,\" he writes. \"Europe, which has made itself far too dependent on the US for its own good, simply follows the Washington line. The absence of diplomacy creates a dynamic of escalation that can lead to nuclear war.\"\n\nThe current president of Latvia, Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds, Sachs noted, recently tweeted, \"Russia must be destroyed.\"\n\nLatvia is a tiny postage stamp country of less than 1.9 million people. It would not make more than a tiny proportion of New York City, Washington, London, Los Angeles or Paris. It could not maintain its prosperity and security for five seconds without enormous inputs every year from the European Union, the United States and NATO. Yet there it is, with its president and diplomats eagerly - even enthusiastically - fanning the flames for thermonuclear war between America and Russia. This is no mere joke: It is an obscenity.\n\nThe practice of diplomacy in the United States has shriveled into a sick joke for decades. General Colin Powell was the last secretary of state who practiced it responsibly and seriously.\n\nHillary Clinton happily reverted to the ludicrous global bullying and bigoted ultraliberal intolerance of her bosom buddy Madeleine Albright. In Michael McFaul she even appointed to Moscow and fully supported a US ambassador who openly ridiculed, sneered and sought to discredit the established leader of a thermonuclear superpower capable of incinerating the United States, as if this could and would have no consequence. President Barack Obama, a vain, superficial and ridiculous man, did not care.\n\nJohn Kerry was a weak, even farcical secretary of state in his priorities and passivity in the face of the hijacking of his department by mad neoconservative and neoliberal lunatics such as McFaul, Victoria Nuland and other personal favorites of Hillary Clinton.\n\nYet even Kerry recognized the need to get on personally with and maintain communication and a modicum of respect towards his immensely experienced and responsible Russian opposite number Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\n\nHowever, since Kerry left office at the beginning of 2017, there has not been even that.\n\nPresident Donald Trump briefly toyed with appointing a responsible, dignified secretary of state in Rex Tillerson at the very beginning of his administration: It did not last. Trump tired of Tillerson, the way a petulant child tires of a boring toy and dropped him after only 14 months. Thereafter, Trump threw the reins of diplomacy over to his CIA Director Mike Pompeo, another fake macho, ignorant, brutish boor and simplistic clown in whom he was well pleased.\n\nIn fact, neither the liberal Democratic fake Left nor the ignorant, blundering, fake macho Right has a clue as to how serious diplomacy in the national interest can and should be conducted.\n\nThe Left has long chased after vague, multilateral, global will o' the wisp agreements to abolish all nuclear power and weapons, deindustrialize the globe and create a new fantasy sustainable green prosperity without any recourse to oil, coal or natural gas power sources at all. The idea of promoting and safeguarding the genuine national interests of the American people is abhorrent to it.\n\nThe Old Right reveres Free Trade as if it was handed down by the Founding Fathers, rather than swallowed wholesale under Ronald Reagan after being a Liberal Democratic Idol for the previous two centuries. And it has never yet found a defenseless country it could resist bombing into catastrophic collapse. There are no human rights to be gallantly defended when their supposed recipients have been killed and crippled beneath millions of tons of rubble.\n\nThe Liberal Left and the Neocon Right alike endlessly preach the value of human rights wildly seeking to destabilize major powers from Russia and China to India while lacking the guts and practicality to ever take any concrete action to prevent the most monstrous genocides and collapse of societies triggered by Western aggressive actions around the world from Biafra in the 1960s to Syria and Libya over the past decade.\n\nAs for the current President of the United States, he early on set the standard for global dignity and reduction of international tensions by publicly referring to the President of Russia as \"a crazy SOB\".\n\nIn fairness to Biden, he was probably just looking in a mirror and mistook himself for President Vladimir Putin when he made that remark.\n\nBiden then set a new standard for imbecility when he stated, as Professor Sachs also noted, about President Xi Jinping of China, \"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power\" before sending 100-year-old former secretary of state Henry Kissinger to Beijing to please beg the Chinese to stop selling US Treasuries.\n\n\"It has been the US and its allies that have broken agreements and refused diplomacy. The US violated its solemn pledges to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and to Russian President Boris Yeltsin that NATO would not move one inch eastward,\" Sachs noted.\n\nProfessor Sachs of course is doing no more than repeating what should be an obvious truth. I covered those negotiations at the time and often interviewed many of the key negotiators on both sides. And I can certainly confirm the accuracy of Sachs' account.\n\nSachs further recalls, \"The US cheated by supporting the violent coup in Kiev that toppled Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych. The US, Germany, France, and the UK, duplicitously refused to back the Minsk II agreement.\"\n\nIndeed, they did so refuse: And the awful slaughter of half a million Ukrainian boys and young men in a war that Washington's neocons and neo-libs still want to fight to the last drop of blood - of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples - never of their own - still continues.\n\nFurther, it was, as Professor Sachs also records, the United States that unilaterally withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2022 and from the Intermediate Force Agreement in 2019. And it was the United States, not Russia that refused to negotiate when Putin proposed a draft Russia-US Treaty on Security Guarantees on December 15, 2021.\n\nAmazingly, as Sachs documents, there has been no direct diplomacy whatsoever between Biden and Putin since the beginning of 2022. And when Russia and Ukraine negotiated directly in March 2022, the United States and the United Kingdom stepped in to block any agreement that would be based on Ukrainian neutrality - a dignified and freedom-preserving future for that great people and tragic land.\n\nDiplomacy Matters - And so does its Lack.\n\nThe political leadership of the United States, Right and Left, Republican and Democrat, male and female, is now in the hands of a generation of ignorant, spoiled brats who are incapable of ever admitting their own incompetence - and that they are ever, indeed always, wrong.\n\nAmerica's leaders, serene in their stupidity and impregnable self-righteousness, continue to self-indulgently fan awful, endless wars that they refuse -on what they think is principle - to ever settle or end.\n\nThey have set the whole world ablaze. And soon the fires they have lit everywhere, like the Biblical Fool excoriated in the Book of Proverbs, will devour them.",

        "title": "Russian soldiers who quit Putin's war get no hero's welcome abroad as asylum claims surge - KION546",
        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "title": "This is why is Sudan still at war a year on",
        "text": "Smoke rises above buildings after aerial bombardment in Khartoum North, Sudan. Picture: REUTERS\n\nA conflict in Sudan that erupted a year ago has wreaked havoc across swathes of the country, unleashed waves of ethnic violence in Darfur, driven millions into extreme hunger and created the world's largest displacement crisis.\n\nWhat triggered the violence?\n\nTension had been building for months before fighting between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) erupted in the capital, Khartoum, on April 15 2023.\n\nThe army and RSF had been in a fragile partnership after toppling a civilian government in an October 2021 coup, a move that derailed a transition from the rule of Islamist autocrat Omar al-Bashir, who was ousted amid a popular uprising in 2019.\n\nThe rivalry between the two sides burst into the open over an internationally backed plan that would have launched a new transition with civilian parties and was due to be sealed just before the war broke out.\n\nBoth the army and the RSF were required to cede power under the plan and two issues proved especially contentious. One was the timetable for the RSF to be integrated into the regular armed forces. A second was the chain of command between the army and RSF leaders and the question of civilian oversight.\n\nThe warring parties have also been in competition over sprawling business interests that reach beyond Sudan's borders.\n\nWho are the main players on the ground?\n\nThe protagonists in the power struggle are Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, head of the army and leader of Sudan's ruling council since 2019, and his former deputy on the council, RSF leader General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, commonly known as Hemedti.\n\nThe whereabouts of the two men was often unclear in the early stages of the conflict as fighting subsumed Khartoum. Later, Burhan began to make public appearances in Sudan, as the army and allied government ministries established a presence in the Red Sea city of Port Sudan.\n\nBoth Burhan and Hemedti travelled outside the country to rally support.\n\nHemedti, who grew wealthy through gold mining and other ventures, is the undisputed leader of the RSF. Members of his family and clan play leading roles and the force's support base is the western region of Darfur, where the RSF emerged from militias that fought alongside government forces to crush rebels in a brutal war that escalated after 2003.\n\nHemedti has also courted some civilian politicians who were involved in plans for a democratic transition before the war.\n\nAnalysts say Burhan's position is less assured at the head of the army, where Islamist-leaning Bashir loyalists and veterans have gained sway since the 2021 coup.\n\nThe RSF routinely says it is fighting to rid Sudan of remnants of Bashir's regime, while the army says it is trying to protect the state against \"criminal\" rebels.\n\nWitnesses say the RSF and its allies have committed extensive abuses including ethnically targeted killings, sexual violence and looting. Residents have accused the army of killing civilians in indiscriminate shelling and air strikes. Both sides have largely denied the accusations against them.\n\nWho is winning?\n\nThough Sudan's army has superior resources, including air power and an estimated 300,000 troops, the RSF had grown in recent years into a well-equipped force of some 100,000 deployed around the country.\n\nIn the first days of the war, the RSF's more nimble units embedded in neighbourhoods across the capital. Towards the end of 2023, the RSF made a series of rapid advances to consolidate its grip on Darfur and take over El Gezira state south of Khartoum, a key agricultural area.\n\nMore recently however, the army has regained some footing, making its most significant advances to date in Omdurman, one of the three cities that make up the wider capital.\n\nWhat is at stake?\n\nThe uprising that led to Bashir's overthrow had raised hopes that Sudan and its population of 49-million could emerge from decades of autocracy, internal conflict and economic isolation.\n\nBut a year of warfare has inflicted huge damage on infrastructure, forced more than 8.5-million people from their homes and driven almost 5-million people to near-famine conditions.\n\nHomes, offices, warehouses and banks have been widely looted, hospitals put out of service and trade and farming disrupted. Thousands of civilians have been killed -- death toll estimates are highly uncertain -- and both sides have been accused of committing war crimes.\n\nAid agencies say fighting, looting and bureaucratic hurdles have severely hampered the delivery of relief.\n\nIntensified political and ethnic rivalries within Sudan have led to fears that the country, Africa's third largest by area, could splinter, destabilising a volatile region bordering the Sahel, the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people have fled to Egypt, Chad and South Sudan, with smaller numbers crossing into Ethiopia and the Central African Republic.\n\nBoth sides have been using gold, Sudan's most valuable and widely smuggled resource, to support their war effort.\n\nWhat is the role of foreign states?\n\nThe conflict has played into competition for influence in Sudan and the surrounding region among regional and global powers including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and Russia.\n\nGulf states have previously pursued investments in sectors including agriculture, where Sudan holds vast potential, and ports. Russia has been seeking to build a naval base on Sudan's Red Sea coast.\n\nThe UAE has provided arms to the RSF, according to reporting by UN experts, while sources say Iran has flown in military support for the army.\n\nEgypt, itself ruled by military man President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi who overthrew his Islamist predecessor, has deep ties to Burhan and the army.\n\nWestern powers, including the US, had swung behind the transition towards democratic elections following Bashir's overthrow. Diplomatic attention on Sudan has been limited by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nWhat efforts have been made to end the war?\n\nLast year Saudi Arabia and the US brought delegations from both factions to Jeddah for talks, but the ceasefires agreed there were repeatedly violated and the process faltered.\n\nOther initiatives have been launched by African regional grouping IGAD and by Egypt, leading to concern about overlapping diplomatic efforts and rivalry.\n\nFighting has continued in past weeks despite appeals for a ceasefire from the UN Security Council and secretary-general during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan\n\nThe recently appointed US special envoy for Sudan is pushing for a restart of talks this month in Jeddah.\n\nParis is hosting a donors' conference on April 15 to try to mobilise aid funding and secure more access for humanitarian workers.",

Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status.

None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum.

        "text": "{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nUkrainian commander Odin's lower leg was blown off in a mine explosion last year. He's now back in the trenches.\n\n\"I had offers to go back to my local academy as a teacher or to work at a draft office in Odesa,\" the 32-year-old from the 28th Separate Mechanised Brigade said from a cramped bunker on the front line in the eastern region of Donetsk.\n\n\"I said I'm not interested in these positions.\"\n\nMango, a 28-year-old tank gunner, saw his hand shredded by shrapnel two years ago during fighting in Mariupol before he was captured by the Russians. He too has returned to the front, as logistics chief for a battalion in the Azov Brigade, which held out for months in defence of the southern city.\n\nUkraine's drained and depleted army needs all the help it can get. It is being driven back by its far larger, more powerful enemy around the eastern city of Avdiivka while coming under increasing pressure at other sections of the front.\n\n\"When I got back from captivity, I realised the war wasn't over,\" said Mango, who like Odin and most Ukrainian soldiers goes by his military call sign for security reasons.\n\n\"Even though I can't sit inside a tank, I can still be useful. I can still fight a bit.\"\n\nThe two soldiers are among thousands of Ukrainian troops who have lost limbs since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in early 2022. While the Kyiv government declined to share data on casualties, which it deems sensitive, Pryncyp, a leading human rights organisation representing military personnel, put the number of amputees from the war at between 20,000 and 50,000.\n\nBattlefields are littered with mines, while artillery and drone attacks are a constant menace, meaning the grim number is rising steadily.\n\nReuters interviewed 20 military amputees for this article, seven of whom had returned to the army or intended to do so. For many of those able to do so, the desire to support their beleaguered comrades on the battlefield remains strong.\n\nMasi Nayyem, co-founder of Pryncyp, said it was fairly common to see soldiers with artificial limbs still serving, though he didn't know how many had returned to the military and how many had entered civilian life.\n\nThe nature of their role will often be decided by the extent of the injuries, said Nayyem, who lost an eye in combat in June 2022. Soldiers with amputations below the knee, for example, are often deemed fit for service in support units but not for highly mobile or specialized roles, according to Pryncyp.\n\nTony Bloomfield, operations director at the British military charity for limbless veterans Blesma, said it was generally extremely rare for soldiers who have lost a limb to return to the conflict, but that this was happening in Ukraine.\n\n\"The nature of the conflict is leaving lots of limb loss,\" said Bloomfield, whose team has spent time with wounded Ukrainian soldiers to help them adapt to limb loss, adding that artillery barrages were a major cause of the injuries.\n\n\"Some of the Ukrainians we met, yes absolutely they want to go back and fight if they're able to,\" he said. \"The difference here again, for Ukraine, is that if you leave the military, your country is still at war. And you're still at risk of injury.\"\n\nKyiv is desperate to replenish its ranks.\n\nSoldiers say they are outnumbered and outgunned along the 1,000-km front line in the east and south of Ukraine. During Moscow's months-long assault on Avdiivka, some Ukrainian troops said they had been outnumbered by around seven to one.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed a bill this month to lower the draft age from 27 to 25, while a mobilisation bill aimed at drafting potentially hundreds of thousands more troops has made its way only slowly through parliament.\n\nBoth Odin and Mango - career soldiers who were in the military before the Russian invasion - expressed a sense of responsibility for the soldiers they had left behind in the trenches and of guilt that they had survived their injuries and could live in relative safety away from the fighting.\n\nOdin had little hesitation in asking superiors for permission to return to combat after he had undergone surgery and rehabilitation with a prosthetic limb.\n\nAt his mortar position in Donetsk, he moves freely up and down the trenches, speaking with members of his unit and giving orders. But he says he still has an intense fear of triggering a mine again as he fights Russian forces.\n\n\"Despite some saying everything was bad and that continuing a normal life was impossible, I'm living a full life,\" he said later, perched on a bed in the bunker and lifting a trouser leg to reveal his prosthetic limb.\n\n\"It's just different twice a day: in the morning when I put on the prosthesis and at night when I take it off,\" he added.\n\nMango was one of hundreds of Ukrainians defending the Azostal steel plant in an ultimately futile last stand to hold the city of Mariupol before it fell in May 2022.\n\n\"I wanted to check my watch to see what time it was,\" he recalled of the day of the injury. \"I raised my hand, saw my watch wasn't there any more. My hand was completely shredded, bones sticking out and all.\"\n\nConvincing top brass that he still had a military role to play was not easy. Mango said he had to ask his commander to submit a report to the authorities confirming that there was a suitable position for him in the unit.\n\n\"At every medical check-up, there was always one surgeon who would ask if I had reconsidered my decision, and each time I said 'No',\" said Mango, who's hoping to have a bionic hand fitted to allow him to use artificial fingers.\n\nIn some ways, said the amputees interviewed, those who don't return to the military find the transition to civilian life even harder to navigate.\n\nLeaving the army means negotiating a new set of challenges, from getting around a town or apartment to finding a job, as well as dealing with civilians who don't always know how to act when they come into contact with amputees.\n\nThe government provides high-quality prosthetics to those who lose limbs in combat as well as rehabilitation treatment. War amputees also receive payouts that vary according to the severity of the injuries. There is money available for servicing artificial limbs and individuals can raise funds privately or through charities for advanced prosthetics such as bionic hands.\n\nNayyem, of soldiers' rights group Pryncyp, said the government was not doing enough to support amputees as they seek employment and that those initiatives that did exist were focused on the big cities.\n\n\"I mean, the state prioritised sending you to die, but didn't make it a priority to help you recover when you got injured,\" he said. \"All the wounded feel this.\"\n\nHe added that the number of people affected by amputations, either directly or indirectly, would only climb as the war ground on with no end in sight.\n\nUkraine's Veteran Affairs Ministry, which oversees amputees, didn't respond when asked about criticism that it was not doing enough to support amputees, particularly over the longer term.\n\nOleksandr Revtiukh lost his left arm and most of his left leg in multiple mine blasts while fighting Russian forces during last summer's counteroffensive in the south, making a return to combat virtually impossible.\n\nWhile the traumas of the war remain, the 33-year-old is focusing on his future outside of the military. The former electronics technician, who enlisted to fight months after Russia's February 2022 invasion, wants to build a social media profile as a motivational boxing coach for fellow amputees.\n\n\"Don't be afraid to make mistakes,\" he said. \"Look for a way out, there is a path through the thorns to the stars. This is my motto.\"\n\nBy Thomas Peter\n\nOleksandr Revtiukh fires a vicious hook at the seasoned fighter facing him. He's in the boxing ring, eight months after losing his left arm and most of his left leg in mine blasts while fighting in Ukraine.\n\nRevtiukh follows with a snarling jab. His old life is gone. Only two years ago he had enjoyed a comfortable civilian life as an electronics technician abroad, before he returned to Ukraine to sign up and fight the Russian invasion.\n\nA furious uppercut, bellowing with the effort. The war has left trauma. Now he has to accept what has happened to him and learn to live without his lost limbs.\n\n\"It's like being a newborn child,\" the 33-year-old says during a break in training at a gym in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. \"You've got to get to know the world from scratch.\"\n\nRevtiukh, who has a prosthetic leg, is one of tens of thousands of Ukrainian combat amputees who are having to adapt to a new life as civilians or back in the military.\n\nHis sister Natasha films the sparring session with leading Ukrainian boxer Aram Faniyan, to upload to her brother's social media accounts where he's trying to make his name as a motivational coach for others in his position.\n\n\"I can't be afraid to make mistakes,\" Revtiukh told Reuters. \"Look for a way out, there is a path through the thorns to the stars. This is my motto.\"\n\nRevtiukh, who left a well-paid job in Hungary in April 2022 to return to fight in Ukraine, lost his arm and leg in June last year during the summer's counteroffensive, and narrowly cheated death. He benefited from the support of his family as he underwent surgery and rehabilitation provided by the state.\n\nAs for what comes next he must make his own way, in a country where many amputees say that budget constraints, social taboos and a lack of job opportunities are making that transition more difficult.\n\nEx-soldier and lawyer Masi Nayyem, co-founder of Pryncyp, a human rights organisation representing soldiers, estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 soldiers had become amputees in Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nOfficial figures are not published and are considered sensitive by the military, but as the war drags into its third year with no end in sight, the numbers will only grow.\n\nNayyem said there were too few jobs available for the wounded, and that most initiatives to help them were in cities, leaving maimed soldiers in rural areas and small towns stranded.\n\n\"If a person is not integrated, what will they become? They will be depressed, and they will not be able to earn money.\"\n\nUkraine's Veteran Affairs Ministry, which oversees amputees, declined to give official data on the number of soldiers who had lost limbs. It did not respond to such criticism that it wasn't doing enough to support amputees once they reentered society after receiving initial hospital rehab with prosthetic limbs.\n\nRostyslav Prystupa, a former soldier partially paralysed after a piece of shrapnel hit his spine while fighting in Mariupol, said he was mindful that veterans also had to learn to support themselves in civilian life.\n\n\"When you keep doing everything for people, they won't learn to do it themselves,\" he added. \"You're not going to do everything for them their whole lives. Someday I'll have to do it myself, and then I won't be able to, and no one will be there.\"\n\nRevtiukh is close to his family, and recently visited his parents' home in Nizhyn, northeast of Kyiv. Waiting outside, his grandmother wept as she embraced Revtiukh, whom she had not seen since his arm and leg were torn off in two separate mine blasts.\n\n\"My little Sasha. I thank God that you are alive,\" she sobbed, using the diminutive of his first name.\n\nRevtiukh described how he was wounded when he triggered anti-personnel mines during chaotic fighting to seize back territory from the Russians in the southern Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nHe recalled nearly suffocating from the dirt and shrapnel in his mouth after one explosion, but a fellow soldier, a 22-year-old named Gleb who was also wounded, cleared his airways and saved his life.\n\nAs Revtiukh begins his journey into civilian life, the boxing enthusiast is, for now, trying his hand at motivational coaching and ultimately he plans to become a history teacher in his native city of Nizhyn in northern Ukraine.\n\nHe has no regrets about the path he has taken, saying he and other veterans like him would set an example for the next generation.\n\n\"They'll look to us as a model in the struggle for independence, freedom of speech and the preservation of human lives.\"",

        "text": "The OJ Simpson saga was a unique American moment. 3 decades on, we're still wondering what it means\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- O.J. Simpson's death came almost exactly three decades after the murders that changed his reputation from football hero to suspect and cultural touchstone. It summoned remembrances of an odd moment in time in which the country watched a Ford Bronco inch its way along a California freeway with no idea what would happen next. Looking at the case and how it was watched from the vantage point of 2024 offers glimpses into how American society and media have changed in the course of a generation. It also reveals what in today's culture might be descended from those weird days in 1994 and 1995.\n\nLegendary athlete, actor and millionaire: O.J. Simpson's murder trial lost him the American dream\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) -- For a long time, O.J. Simpson had it all. He lived the American dream as a sports legend, movie actor, commercial pitchman and millionaire. With his wildly successful career, good looks and a gorgeous wife, he became an image of success for Black Americans and was embraced by people of all races. His sensational trial for the murder of his white ex-wife and her friend transfixed the nation and divided the country along racial lines. A criminal court jury found him not guilty of murder in 1995, but a separate civil trial jury found him liable in 1997 for the deaths and ordered him to pay $33.5 million to the family members of the victims. Simpson died Wednesday of prostate cancer. He was 76.\n\nRussian soldiers who quit Putin's war get no hero's welcome abroad as asylum claims surge\n\nASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- Growing numbers of Russian soldiers are trying to get out of the war in Ukraine. Overall asylum claims from Russians have surged in the U.S., France and Germany since Russia's full-scale invasion two years ago, but few are getting in. Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes? The Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted, some through underground networks of Russian activists who guided them on secret escape routes. Facing criminal charges in Russia, all but one live in hiding as they wait for a welcome from the West that hasn't arrived. They argue that helping deserters is in the West's own interest and less costly than shipping weapons to Ukraine.\n\nMore aid is supposed to be entering the Gaza Strip. Why isn't it helping?\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- Under heavy U.S. pressure, Israel has promised to ramp up aid to Gaza dramatically, saying last week it would open another cargo crossing and surge more trucks than ever before into the besieged enclave. But days later there are few signs of those promised materializing and international officials say famine is fast approaching. While Israel says it has dramatically increased the number of aids trucks entering the territory, U.N. workers report only a slight uptick -- possibly because they count trucks differently. Here's what we know about the aid entering Gaza and why discrepancies in reporting persist.\n\nMuslim leaders are 'out of words' as they tire of the White House outreach on the war in Gaza\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Some Muslim and Arab American leaders have grown frustrated with the outreach from President Joe Biden's White House as the war in Gaza drags on. They say private meetings with officials at all levels of the administration have failed to lead to meaningful changes in U.S. support for Israel, and they're unwilling to continue talking. The fractured relationship could jeopardize the Democratic president's reelection campaign and help pave the way for Republican Donald Trump to return to the White House. Biden's team believes it still can have some productive conversations to keep open important lines of communication.\n\nMany say Biden and Trump did more harm than good, but for different reasons, AP-NORC poll shows\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that more than half of U.S. adults think Joe Biden's presidency has hurt the country on cost of living and immigration. Meanwhile, nearly half think Donald Trump's presidency hurt the country on voting rights and election security, relations with foreign countries, abortion laws and climate change. The poll numbers also show Americans generally think that in the White House, both did more harm than good. Meanwhile, when asked which president did more to help people like them, roughly one-third say Donald Trump and about one-quarter say Joe Biden. Yet roughly 30% of adults said neither Biden nor Trump benefitted them.\n\nManhattan court must find a dozen jurors to hear first-ever criminal case against a former president\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A dozen Manhattan residents are soon to become the first Americans ever to sit in judgment of a former president charged with a crime. Jury selection is set to start Monday in former President Donald Trump's hush-money trial. The presumptive Republican nominee has pleaded not guilty. The proceedings present a historic challenge for the court, the lawyers and the everyday citizens who find themselves in the jury pool. Those problems include finding people who can be impartial about one of the most polarizing figures in American life and detecting any bias among prospective jurors without invading the privacy of the ballot box.\n\n'I'm dying, you're not': Those terminally ill ask more states to legalize physician-assisted death\n\nDENVER (AP) -- Lawmakers in at least 12 states are debating bills that would legalize physician-assisted death. The laws would allow terminally ill patients under specified conditions to end their lives with a doctor's help. Physician-assisted death is contentious and only 10 states and Washington, D.C., allow it. Patients must be at least 18 years old, within six months of death and be assessed by doctors to ensure they are capable of making an informed decision. Two states have gone in the opposite direction. Kansas has a bill to further criminalize those who help someone with their physician-assisted death. West Virginia is asking voters to enshrine its current ban into the state constitution.\n\n20 years later, Abu Ghraib detainees get their day in US court\n\nALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Twenty years ago this month, photos of abused prisoners and smiling U.S. soldiers guarding them at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison were released, shocking the world. Now, three survivors of Abu Ghraib will finally get their day in U.S. court against the military contractor they hold responsible for their mistreatment. A trial scheduled to begin Monday in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, will be the first time that Abu Ghraib survivors have been able to bring their claims of torture to a U.S. jury. The defendant in the civil suit, CACI, supplied the interrogators who worked at the prison. The Virginia-based contractor denies any wrongdoing.\n\nIf O.J. Simpson's assets go to court, Goldman, Brown families could be first in line\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson died without having paid the lion's share of the $33.5 million judgment a civil jury awarded to the families of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. The panel found Simpson liable in a wrongful death lawsuit in 1997. Now, his money is likely to go into the court probate process. And the Goldman and Brown families could be at the front of the line to get paid a piece of whatever Simpson left behind. If he had any meaningful assets at all, his four children will have to let a court look at them before they can receive it.",

        "text": "South Korea and the US have agreed to hold tabletop exercises that simulate North Korea's nuclear weapons use to strengthen a joint response.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of National Defense in Seoul on Friday, the two countries confirmed the plans at the 24th Korea-US Integrated Defense Consultative Group held in Washington on Thursday.\n\nThe meeting in Washington was attended by a South Korean delegation led by Cho Chang-rae, the deputy minister of national defense. The US delegation was led by Ely Ratner, assistant secretary of defense for Indo-Pacific security affairs; and Andrew Winternitz, acting deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia.\n\nThe TTX, which reflects a scenario of North Korea using nuclear weapons, was agreed upon at the last meeting of the bilateral Nuclear Consultative Group.\n\n\"South Korea and the US are committed to demonstrating the strength of our Alliance and the combined defense posture through a close and coordinated joint response to provocations, threats and activities by North Korea that undermine peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula,\" the defense ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe ministry said the US \"reaffirmed its commitment to defend the Republic of Korea with the full range of US military capabilities -- including nuclear, conventional, missile defense and advanced non-nuclear capabilities -- and to deploy strategic assets in a regular and visible manner.\"\n\nThe US also \"reiterated that any nuclear attack by the DPRK against the United States or its allies is unacceptable and will lead to the end of the Kim Jong-un regime\" the ministry said.\n\nThe ministry said the two sides agreed to improve training conditions, including by sharing facilities and airspace in South Korea, and to modernize alliance capabilities by leveraging the science and technologies of both countries.\n\nBoth sides noted that the second military spy satellite launched by South Korea is an important asset for joint reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities, and agreed to continue cooperation through the Space Cooperation Working Group.\n\nThey also pledged to strengthen the United Nations Command in Korea, recognizing its \"longstanding contribution to peace and stability here,\" according to the ministry.\n\nThe ministry said South Korea and the US share the belief that North Korea-Russia military cooperation \"undermines peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region, including the Korean Peninsula,\" and that \"a trilateral cooperation with Japan was critical to achieving security goals.\"\n\nSouth Korea, the US and Japan conducted naval exercises Thursday and Friday at the Kadena Air Base in Okinawa with six warships from the three countries, including the Aegis destroyer Seoae Ryu Seong-ryong.\n\nThe two-day exercises were part of the trilateral plan established under the Camp David agreement reached by the leaders of the three countries.\n\nThe exercises focused on enhancing the joint response capabilities of South Korea, the US and Japan in the face of increasing nuclear and missile threats, including North Korea's recent ballistic missile launches.\n\nAnti-submarine drills aimed at improving the ability to counter North Korea's underwater threats, including submarine-launched ballistic missiles, were held over the two days.\n\nMaritime interdiction drills to prevent North Korea's illegal transportation of weapons of mass destruction and search and rescue drills in the event of a ship in duress were also conducted.",

        "title": "Many say Biden and Trump did more harm than good, but for different reasons, AP-NORC poll shows - KION546",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- There's a reason why President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are spending so much time attacking each other -- people don't think either man has much to brag about when it comes to his own record. Americans generally think that while they were in the White House, both did more harm than good on key issues.\n\nBut the two candidates have different weak spots. For Biden, it's widespread unhappiness on two issues: the economy and immigration. Trump, meanwhile, faces an electorate where substantial shares think he harmed the country on a range of issues.\n\nA new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that more than half of U.S. adults think Biden's presidency has hurt the country on cost of living and immigration, while nearly half think Trump's presidency hurt the country on voting rights and election security, relations with foreign countries, abortion laws and climate change.\n\n\"Considering the price of gas, the price of groceries, the economy -- I did very well during those four years,\" Christina Elliott, 60, a Republican from Texas, said of the Trump presidency. \"I didn't have to worry about filling up my tank or losing half of my paycheck to the grocery store.\"\n\nElliott wasn't too keen on Trump's handling of abortion and said that when it comes to the former president's rhetoric, \"He just needs to learn how to be tactful and shut his mouth.\"\n\n\"But other than that, like I said, I did very well during the Trump years,\" she added.\n\nThe polling underscores why certain issues -- such as abortion for Biden and immigration for Trump -- have been persistent focal points for each of the campaigns. The former president regularly decries the number of asylum-seekers who have arrived in the U.S. under Biden, describing the situation in apocalyptic and dark terms. And Biden has gone on the offensive against Trump on abortion, especially after this week's ruling from the Arizona Supreme Court that essentially criminalized the procedure in the state.\n\nWhen asked which president did more to help people like them, roughly one-third say Donald Trump and about one-quarter say Joe Biden. Yet 30% of adults said neither Biden nor Trump benefitted them. It's another data point reflecting an electorate that has been largely disappointed with this year's general election choices, generating little enthusiasm among key parts of the Biden and Trump political coalitions.\n\nAmericans rate Biden particularly negatively on a few specific issues. Only about 2 in 10 Americans think Biden's presidency helped \"a lot\" or \"a little\" on cost of living, and 16% say that about immigration and border security. Nearly 6 in 10 say his presidency hurt a lot or a little on these issues. Nearly half, 46%, of Americans, by contrast, say that Trump's presidency helped a lot or a little on immigration or border security. Four in 10 say it helped on cost of living.\n\nTexas resident Trelicia Mornes, 36, said she feels the Biden presidency has hurt a lot when it comes to everyday expenses.\n\n\"Now that he's in the office, the cost of living has spiked out of control, and there's nothing being done about it,\" Mornes, a Democrat, said, pointing to rising costs of rent and food. She said she believes Biden can do more, \"He just chooses to do other things.\"\n\nThe pandemic hurt Trump in terms of employment as the economy lost 2.7 million jobs under his watch. But the pandemic lockdowns also dramatically curbed inflation. At the same time, low interest rates and historic levels of deficit-funded government stimulus left many households feeling better off under Trump.\n\nComing out of the pandemic, Biden gave the economy a boost with additional aid that helped spur job gains of 15.2 million under his watch. But supply chain issues, Russia's war in Ukraine and Biden's aid package are judged by many economists as having contributed to rising inflation, hurting the Democrat's approval ratings.\n\nTrump's advantage on the cost of living and immigration is driven partially by Democrats' lack of enthusiasm about Biden's performance. About one-third of Democrats, for example, think Biden's presidency hurt on cost of living, and another third think Biden neither helped nor hurt. Just one-third of Democrats think Biden's presidency helped on cost of living. About 3 in 10 Democrats think Biden's presidency helped on immigration and border security, a similar share think his presidency hurt, and about 4 in 10 think it made no difference.\n\nNadia Stepicheva, 38, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, is unhappy with how Biden has handled immigration.\n\n\"The problem is, I really don't like illegal type of immigration,\" Stepicheva said. She thinks that people who enter the U.S., even if they come in illegally, should be allowed to work so that taxpayer dollars aren't used to care for them and house them.\n\nStepicheva said she has always leaned in favor of Democrats and the party's policies, \"But the last four years, I feel like it's getting too much in terms of money spent for immigration, forgiving all these student loans.\" She said she's torn in terms of who she will vote for this November.\n\nBut independents also rate Biden low on these issues: Nearly 6 in 10 independents say Biden's presidency has hurt the country on cost of living. About 4 in 10 independents say Biden's presidency has hurt the country when it comes to the cost of health care and relations with other countries.\n\nTrump has a different problem.\n\nThe former president doesn't have any asked-about issues where more than half of Americans think he did more to hurt things than to help, but the overall sense of harm is somewhat broader. Nearly half of Americans think his presidency did more to hurt than help on climate change, voting rights and election security, abortion laws and relations with foreign countries.\n\nCatherine Scott, a Republican who recently moved to New York from Florida, said she found Trump's approach to foreign policy particularly concerning.\n\n\"I understand that some people really admire Trump's ability to be a spitfire and just say whatever is at the top of his mind,\" said Scott, 30. But, pointing to Trump's complimentary comments toward autocrats like Russian President Vladimir Putin, Scott said, \"I don't think he has all the foresight to understand that might not always be the thing to do.\"\n\nThe best issue for both Biden and Trump overall is job creation. Trump has a small edge here: Nearly half say his presidency helped, while 36% say Biden's presidency helped. About half of Americans also think Trump's presidency helped on immigration and 4 in 10 think his presidency helped on cost of living.\n\nOn every other issue, the share of Americans who say that Biden or Trump helped the country a lot or a little is around 3 in 10 or less. But Republicans, overall, tend to see more of a benefit from Trump's presidency than Democrats do from Biden's -- even on issues where Biden has worked to highlight his victories.\n\nFor example, only about half of Democrats say that Biden's presidency has helped on climate change or the cost of health care. On abortion laws, 77% of Democrats think that Trump's presidency was at least a little harmful, but only about 4 in 10 say that Biden's presidency helped a lot or a little, and a similar share think Biden's presidency hasn't made a difference.\n\nMeanwhile, around 8 in 10 Republicans say that Trump's presidency helped on immigration and border security, creating jobs and cost of living.\n\n--\n\nThe poll of 1,204 adults was conducted April 4-8, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.\n\n--\n\nAssociated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.",

        "text": "PAY ATTENTION: Follow our WhatsApp channel to never miss out on the news that matters to you!\n\nOne of the largest wooden structures ever built is taking shape in Osaka, but hopes that Expo 2025 will unite the world are being dogged by cost blowouts and a lack of public enthusiasm.\n\nThe imposing circular centrepiece will be crowned by a 20-metre-high (65-foot) sloping canopy, designed by top architect Sou Fujimoto, known as the \"Grand Roof\".\n\nIt has a circumference of a staggering two kilometres and 161 countries and territories will show off their trade opportunities and cultural attractions at pavilions within the vast latticed ring.\n\nA crane hoisted a block of beams into place this week as organisers said construction was largely on schedule, one year before visitors will be welcomed.\n\nExpo 2025 global PR director Sachiko Yoshimura maintained that global participants would be \"united\" by the event even though there are conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza and elsewhere.\n\nRussia will not be among the participants at Expo 2025, which will run from April 13 to October 13.\n\n\"Of course there are so many crises around the world, but we want everybody to actually get together and think about the future and sustainability,\" Yoshimura said.\n\nIt has also met a lukewarm response in Japan, where promotion is ramping up and the red-and-blue Expo 2025 mascot \"Myaku-Myaku\" -- billed by the official website as \"a mysterious creature born from the unification of cells and water\" -- is ever-present.\n\nA recent Kyodo News survey found that 82 percent of Japanese companies, sponsors and others involved said \"fostering domestic momentum\" would be a challenge.\n\nThe construction budget has ballooned 27 percent from 2020 estimates to 235 billion yen ($1.5 billion) due to inflation and Japan's chronic worker shortage.\n\nSome say the costs are also hard to justify when 6,300 people are still in evacuation centres and hotels after an earthquake on New Year's Day devastated parts of central Japan.\n\nFujimoto's \"Grand Roof\" alone has a price tag of 35 billion yen and has been slammed by opposition leader Kenta Izumi as \"the world's most expensive parasol\".\n\nThe \"Grand Roof\" and other structures are temporary, with no clear plan for them other than organisers saying they will be reused or recycled.\n\nThe site on an artificial island in Osaka Bay will be cleared after the Expo, with plans to build a resort there containing Japan's first casino.\n\nJun Takashina, deputy secretary general of the Japan Association for Osaka 2025, acknowledged budget and regulatory \"struggles\" among foreign participants but said organisers would help make sure the displays are ready in time.\n\nAmong the most hotly anticipated attractions are flying electric cars, which take off vertically, showcasing the event's technological and environmental aspirations.\n\nBut the vehicles -- subject to reams of regulations -- will be a \"kind of experiment\", Yoshimura said.\n\nMore than 1.2 million tickets have already been sold and organisers hope to attract 28.2 million visitors, including 3.5 million from abroad.\n\nThat would be four million more than the last World Fair in Dubai but pales in comparison to the 64 million people who attended the 1970 Expo in Osaka, a record until it was overtaken by Shanghai in 2010.\n\nThe first world fair to celebrate culture and industrial progress was held in London in 1851, with the Eiffel Tower built for the 1889 Paris World Fair.\n\nOsaka academic Shinya Hashizume, a specialist in architecture history and town planning, said he was amazed as a 10-year-old when he saw a \"future that looked like science fiction\" at the 1970 Expo.\n\nThe first film in IMAX format was shown at that event and visitors could admire rocks brought back from the Moon.\n\n\"Those six months were extraordinary for Osaka. Simply put, the whole town was having a party,\" he said.\n\nThe advent of mass tourism and hyper-connected societies may have since lessened the attraction but some Osaka residents still think it's a good idea.\n\nKosuke Ito, a 36-year-old doctor, said it would \"strengthen the economy\".\n\nHowever, Yuka Nakamura, 26, said she might be put off by adult entry fees ranging from 4,000 to 7,500 yen ($25 to $50) a day.",

        "text": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: , Apr 12 (PTI) The traditional vote-bases of Kerala's ruling CPI(M) and opposition Congress have \"completely collapsed\" due to the \"worst kind of appeasement politics\" pursued by these parties to win over extremist elements in the state, claims senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar.\n\nIn an interview to PTI, Javadekar, who is the BJP's Kerala in-charge, alleged that the Congress-led UDF and the CPI(M)-headed LDF were fighting the polls solely on the agenda of extremist elements, focusing on issues like CAA and Palestine instead of prioritising a development agenda.\n\nDue to this, the other sections of society, considered to be the backbone of the Left party and the Congress, are \"very much angry\" with them, he claimed.\n\n\"Kerala election has entered a very exciting phase of electioneering. I say this because many earlier equations are collapsing. Earlier, it was Muslims and Christians for the UDF while Ezhavas and other Hindus for the CPI(M). But it has completely collapsed,\" Javadekar claimed.\n\nHe said the BJP is fighting the polls solely on the development agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"The CPI(M)-led LDF and the Congress-led UDF -- both are not talking about the development of India. They are focusing on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). They are discussing Palestine. Today, secularism is Sarv Dharma Sama Bhavana, respect for all religions. But instead, they are preaching... their agenda is completely focused on competitive appeasement of extremist elements,\" he alleged.\n\nJavadekar, who has been camping in Kerala for the last several months for building the party's campaign for the Lok Sabha polls, claimed the ban imposed on the Islamist outfit Popular Front of India (PFI) by the BJP-led NDA government was welcomed by an entire section of Kerala society.\n\nAnd the Christians are now upset with the Congress after the SDPI, the political arm of PFI, extended its support to the grand old party in the Lok Sabha polls, \"and they are now coming with Narendra Modi-ji,\" he said.\n\n\"The Ezhava community is very much angry with the CPI(M) because it has started the worst kind of appeasement of extremist elements like PFI. Their whole agenda is that extremist elements' agenda. What are they talking about? They are not talking about the development of Kerala,\" Javadekar alleged.\n\nThe former union minister further said the competitive appeasement of extremist elements practiced by the CPI(M) is a real trigger for Christians also to distance themselves from the ruling party.\n\nAnd the Ezhava community and other sections, who traditionally voted for the CPI(M), are now considering voting for BJP because Modi has helped them, Javadekar said.\n\nThe former Union Information and Broadcasting Minister criticised the stand taken by the CPI(M) and the Congress on telecasting the controversial movie \"The Kerala Story\" by various Christian groups in the state, alleging these parties were intervening in the personal freedom of the people and were again merely offering \"lip service\" to extremist elements.\n\nThe Sudipto Sen-directed \"The Kerala Story\", which hit theatres last year, tells the story of a group of women from Kerala who were forced to convert to Islam and join terror outfit ISIS.\n\nJavadekar further said all sections in Kerala, particularly the Christian community, are happy with the steps taken by the Modi government like banning PFI, working against terrorism, condemning the first attack by Hamas militants on Israeli citizens and condemning terror attack in Russia.\n\nThe former union minister also claimed that the Christian community is coming closer to the BJP and will vote for the party, as \"they know that Rahul Gandhi is not going to become the prime minister and the Congress has no future.\"\n\nAsked about the violence in Manipur and the Christian community's concern over it, Javadekar said it was not a Hindu-Christian fight but a conflict between Kukkis and Meitis -- two tribal communities.\n\nHe accused the Congress and the CPI(M) of \"unleashing a misinformation campaign\" about it in Kerala.\n\nListing the benefits extended to people by the BJP government, Javadekar said, \"Modiji doesn't discriminate,\" while the LDF and the UDF choose their loyalists, favourites, and cadres for extending benefits.\n\nHe said all sections of Kerala society, including Muslims and Christians, are happy with the Modi government because of the development works undertaken by it in the state, including the introduction of Vande Bharat trains and the rapid completion of National Highways.\n\nIn reaching out to the families of expatriates, he noted that Indians living abroad are very happy because India's stature has risen in geopolitics due to PM Modi's diplomacy.\n\nHe also recalled the missions undertaken by the Modi government to rescue priests, nurses, and students stranded in conflict zones like Yemen, Iraq, and Ukraine.\n\n\"So, therefore, it is an exciting phase of the election. We are making a big impact, and people will truly understand on June 4 (the day the votes are counted),\" he said.",

        "text": "{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nIf the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nFive officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military have given interviews. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"",

        "title": "Erdogan's electoral blow will shape Trkiye's foreign policy - ExBulletin",
        "text": "The recent local elections dealt a major blow to President Recep Tayyip Erdoan, marking his biggest electoral defeat to date. The loss was not just any setback; he saw the secular opposition CHP takes control of 35 cities(representing around 80% of Trkiye's GDP and more than 60% of its population), surpassing 24 for Erdoans' AK Party.\n\nThe election result raises the question of whether a seismic shift in domestic politics will alter Turkish foreign policy.\n\nThe elections were significantly influenced by the cost of living crisis.Inflation reached 68.5%and that of Trkiyehunger threshold now exceeds the weekly minimum wage of US$93. The budget deficit and the decline in foreign exchange reserves are causing new concerns. The country's economic fabric is closely linked to the West, in particular to the European Union, which remains Trkiye's main trading partner, absorbing 36% of its exports in 2023. The EU also leads foreign direct investment in Trkiye, representing 59% of investments over the last 20 years. Thus, modernizing the customs union to include services remains a priority. The election results also strengthened Mamolu, the mayor of Istanbul as a major competitorto Erdoan, making economic recovery even more crucial to maintaining his position.\n\nIn addition to continuing to promote Trkiye's economic interests, four recent developments shed light on Turkish foreign policy priorities for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe war in Ukraine underlined the geopolitical importance of Trkiye for the West. Immediately after the 2022 Russian offensive, Ankara invoked the provisions of the 1936 Montreux Convention prohibiting the passage of Russian warships through the Turkish straits.\n\nThe first is the new dynamic in relations with the United States and Egypt. The recent thaw in relations between Trkiye and the United States is highlighted by the conclusion of a deal to sell Trkiye more F-16 fighter jets and Ankara's approval of the membership of the Sweden to NATO. The completion of Erdoan's long-awaited visit to the White House in May indicated new momentum. However, the relationships betweenThe United States and the Kurdish separatist groups PKK and YPGThe Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is classified as a terrorist organization by Western countries, including the United States, but Trkiye says the People's Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish militant group based in Syria that attracts support from the United States, could prevent a complete reset. , is closely linked to the PKK.Trkiyes' aspirations to join the F-35 stealth aircraft program, its desire to seek relief from CAATSA Sanctionsand the ongoing controversy surrounding Trkiye's acquisition of advanced Russian air defense systemsThis also strains relations with the United States.\n\nIn February, Erdoan's first speech visit to Cairo Since 2012, this meeting with President Sissi has symbolized Trkiye's broader reconciliation efforts with the Middle East. Ankara's humanitarian role in Rafah, coupled with its potential to facilitate inter-Palestinian dialogue, brings Egypt and Trkiye closer together, despite their different stakes in the Libyan conflict and Eastern Mediterranean issues.\n\nThe second development concerns Trkiye's position on Ukraine, where she must continue her balancing act of being pro-Ukraine without positioning herself as anti-Russia.\n\nThe war in Ukraine underlined the geopolitical importance of Trkiye for the West. Immediately after the 2022 Russian offensive, Ankara invoked provisions of the Montreux Convention of 1936 banning the passage of Russian warships through the Turkish straits. Subsequently, his mediation of a grain deal between the fighters marked a diplomatic triumph. Ankara wants to maintain this role, supporting Ukraine with military equipment but refraining from aligning with Western sanctions against Russia, thereby preserving its deep trade and energy connections.\n\nThis balancing act shows how Ankara views the world, demonstrating its willingness to engage with all parties while maximizing its autonomy. Last month, Ankara hosted Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and Ukrainian President Zelensky.\n\nThird, eliminating the PKK/YPG remains a top priority for Ankara. In March, Trkiye and Iraq concluded a historic security agreement that resulted in the official ban on the PKK by Iraq. The agreement reinforces Trkiye's plan to expand a military campaign into northern Iraq aimed at establishing a 40 km security zone beyond its borders. Trkiye also aims to neutralize the PKK's influence on the advancement of the development road project, which Erdoan is promoting as an alternative to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) initiative, supported by Israel and the United Arab Emirates, which bypasses both Turkiye and Iraq.\n\nErdoan's latest priority is outreach to the South. In February, Trkiye and Somalia signed an important agreement agreement granting Trkiye control of Somalia's maritime zones for the coming decade, positioning it as a key player in the Red Sea amid growing tensions between the United States and the Houthis in Yemen and the Israeli military offensive in Palestine . Somalia forms a central part of Trkiye's growing footprint in Africa.",

        "title": "China yuan's global FX reserve footprint smallest in 3 years:  McGeever",
        "text": "(Repeats item that first ran on Thursday. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n\nORLANDO, Florida, April 11 (Reuters) - Far from cementing itself as a world reserve currency, China's yuan has gone into reverse and its share of global foreign exchange reserves has fallen to the lowest level in three years.\n\nThe gradual but steady decline since early 2022 reflects the international community's unease about investing in China, which was crystallized in huge foreign capital outflows from Chinese equity and bond markets last year.\n\nWhile China's economy finally seems to be emerging from its post-lockdown funk in the wake of COVID-19, there are plenty of reasons reserve managers may still need convincing to start re-loading up on the renminbi, or yuan.\n\nChina is a global economic and financial superpower, and the yuan's role in cross-border trade and transactions is rising. But there are questions over its economic might, unease over its capital controls, and concern over its geopolitical alliances and militarism.\n\nThe yuan's allure as a global reserve currency is fading.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund's latest composition of foreign exchange reserves (Cofer) data show that of the world's $11.45 trillion in FX reserves where the currency breakdown is known, 2.29% was in renminbi at the end of last year.\n\nThat is the lowest share since the fourth quarter of 2020, and down substantially from the 2.83% peak in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nCentral banks and reserve managers around the world have reduced their yuan allocation in each of the last seven quarters. In nearly two years, the yuan share of their FX reserves has shrunk by a fifth.\n\nMichael Cahill, an FX strategist at Goldman Sachs in London, notes that Chinese government bonds no longer offer reserve managers the yield premium over developed world bonds that they did when the IMF first included the yuan in its Cofer data in 2016.\n\nAnd it's no coincidence that the Chinese currency's FX reserve footprint began to shrink in the first quarter of 2022, when Beijing's ally Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n\"It is also certainly possible that geopolitics have played a role. Academic literature has found that reserve management is in part dictated by geopolitical alignment, and that certainly seems consistent with what we have seen,\" Cahill says.\n\nOf the 10 countries that regularly report a geographic breakdown of their reserve holdings, none have increased their yuan holdings since the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWhile these detailed reports represent only a small fraction of global reserves, Cahill reckons their stance on the yuan signals a \"notable shift\" in FX reserve management.\n\nVisibility around Russia's FX reserves dimmed after the invasion of Ukraine. But at the end of 2021 Russia was the largest holder of yuan reserves, with around a third of all internationally held yuan-denominated reserves, according to analysts at ING.\n\nThey also reckon Moscow may have reduced that stash after the invasion as it had to sell reserves to finance its ballooning budget deficit.\n\nOn the other hand, some smaller countries outside of the 149 nations included in the IMF's Cofer data set may well have increased the yuan-denominated share of their FX reserves in the last couple of years.\n\nIn short, it is hard to measure FX reserves flows with real certainty but as ING points out, the general picture is clear - the renminbi is only one of two currencies, along with the euro, whose share of global FX reserves fell over the 2022-23 two-year period.\n\nThis is an unequivocal reversal from the yuan's early days as a global reserve currency. The IMF's Cofer data show its first share of reported FX reserves at the end of 2016 was 1.08%, which nearly tripled to a peak of 2.83% in early 2022.\n\nIn nominal terms, yuan-denominated FX reserves started at $90.8 billion and reached a high of $337.3 billion in late 2021. They ended last year at $261.7 billion.\n\nThe yuan's share of reserves is falling in exchange rate-adjusted terms too, according to Goldman Sachs. They also hit a three-year low at the end of last year, although the decline has been more gradual and the previous peak was not as high.\n\nReserve managers tend to be conservative, and changes in currency allocations tend to be gradual. That's because managers tend to lean against exchange rate moves in order to keep their make up of their reserves stable - that is, they buy more of a currency when it is weakening.\n\nBut according to analysts at JP Morgan, the yuan has been the \"clearest exception\" to this rule recently. Diversification away from the yuan has continued despite the currency's 10% slide against the dollar in the 2022-23 period.\n\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)",

        "title": "Senators query subsidised fertiliser prices amidst depreciating dollar",
        "text": "NAIROBI, Kenya, Apr 12 - Senators poked holes in the government fertilizer subsidy program insisting the government is hoodwinking farmers in the guise of subsidizing production.\n\nLegislators questioned why the government subsidy was selling fertilizer at Sh2,500 since last year yet the international prices of the essential farming commodity had dropped.\n\nNyeri Senator Wahome Wamatinga emphasized that the cost of fertilizer ought to be reduced by Sh300 given the depreciating dollar in recent months.\n\n\"Given that the dollar has gone down as well as international prices why is it not possible to reduce the cost to align with government agenda on bringing the cost of living down,\" Wamatinga remarked.\n\nMandera Senator Mohammed Chute averred that there is no fertilizer subsidy in the country alluding that the current program is a ploy to enrich few cartels in the government.\n\n\"Prices of the fertilizer on the international market have gone down upto 60 percent. The dollar has gone down, do you feel the Sh 2500 is still a subsidized price,\" Chute stated.\n\nAppearing before Senate Committee on Agriculture to shed light on the claims of fake fertilizer distribution under the government subsidy program, Agriculture CS Mithika Linturi explained the fertilizer had been purchased when international prices had increased.\n\n\"if we had a luxury of more commodities in the market then we can be able to dictate.The Russia-Ukraine had disrupted supply chain which leads to time wastage,\" he said.\n\nThis comes even as farmers who bought substandard fertilizer are set to face losses as CS Linturi remained non-committal on the compensation framework of farmers despite President William Ruto's directive on the matter.\n\nCS Linturi mentioned farmers will be compensated with top dressing fertilizer at an additional fee.\n\n\"We want farmers who took the substandard fertilizer to take back the fertilizer they took then we will rework the money we haven't paid to KEL Chemicals,\"\n\n\"If we can recover that expense will all the money, we owe the company we will give them for free. If it doesn't meet then we will work a formula to see whether they will pick the fertilizer at a lower cost,\" he said.\n\nSentiments which irked Senators who demanded that farmers should be compensated with top dressing fertilizer with no additional fee as both fertilizer cost Sh 2500.\n\nThe lawmakers questioned the compensation framework if at all farmers will be forced to buy the top-dressing fertilizer from National Cereal Produce Board (NCPB) at an additional cost.\n\n\"The President was very clear that farmers should be compensated. Compensation cannot come at an extra cost. Who will benefit from this extra cost they are paying yet they were given substandard fertilizer,\" said the chair of the committee, James Murango.\n\nDetails emerged that KEL Chemicals, the firm that sold substandard fertilizer, dispatched 69,070 bags to the NCPB stores.\n\nNCPB Managing Director Joseph Kimote told senators that they sold 64,374 bags of fertilizer on behalf the firm with Sh 170 Million funds remitted to the firm within days.\n\nLinturi said his Ministry has no additional budget to compensate farmers hence they will bear the additional cost should the remaining monies owed to KEL Chemical fall short of the total compensation.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture only 3000 bags of fertilizer were substandard but a spot check by senators showed a possibility of extra bags.\n\nIn Nandi and Embu Counties alone, a total of 4,680 bags of fertilizer were substandard despite assertion by CS Linturi that only 3000 bags didn't meet the necessary parameters.\n\n\"We are not going to pay the remaining monies for KEL Chemicals until investigation are concluded. There's no cause for alarm until the investigation are done,\" the Agriculture CS said.\n\nSenators queried how substandard fertilizer was dispatched to NCPB stores with the government realizing substandard fertilizer distribution after farmers bought the farming product.\n\n\"Before we commenced the distribution, we were conceived that all the firms had met the standard. We did all due diligence, the firms had been in the market for a long period of time,\" Kimote stated.\n\nKimote stated that the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) and Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS) had ascertained KEL Chemicals had compiled with all the requirements.\n\nKimote insisted NCPB has no quality assurance mechanism only a batch of the certified fertilizer had failed the necessary requirement test saying the firm should face the blame for the erroneous mistake.\n\n\"If they are issues with the standard, it's the prerogative of the manufacturers to take into account. Our quality assurance doesn't have the capacity. We rely on other government agencies,\"",

        "title": "Dollar Holds Better Cards Against Both Euro and Pound - Action Forex",
        "text": "The ECB laid the groundwork for a June rate cut yesterday and that was basically all there was to say about it. Lagarde revealed some wanted to cut rates already and reports afterwards wrote about a handful of officials that needed extra convincing to rally behind the decision to stand pat for a little while longer. European yields erased a kneejerk move lower with markets expecting a June move for some time now. Changes in the swap curve ranged between +1.1 and 4.8 bps with a higher open accounting for most of the gains. US Treasury yields from the 5y tenor on wiped out earlier losses and moved to fresh YtD highs, adding 2.7-5.7 bps. A mediocre $22bn 30y auction with a slight tail and weaker bidding metrics had little market impact. The front end hovered sideways near the recent highs. The 2y could resist an intraday test of the 5% level after another solid reading of weekly jobless claims though. The US dollar maintained the upper hand against an overall weak euro. EUR/USD dropped to 1.0699 before paring losses to 1.0726. USD/JPY eked out another 34y-high of 153.27. Sterling licked its wounds after Wednesday's sell-off against USD. GBP/USD fights to keep the 1.25 support zone alive. EUR/GBP slipped though, with all of the steady April \"gains\" now wiped out. BoE policymaker Greene hit the wires often these past few days. She voted to keep rates steady in recent meetings and her comments suggest she'll continue to do so for some time to come. Greene said she is still far off backing rate reductions with wage growth and the risk of inflation persistence still too high. She sided with her hawkish colleagues Haskel and Mann in that markets have been too optimistic in their rates pricing. UK money markets have adjusted their thinking in recent days to just 50 bps of cuts this year though.\n\nWe'll get some more views of central bankers today and they could spark some intraday movement. Speeches by Schmid (Kansas City) and Bostic (Atlanta) are worth the attention after the recent string of stellar US data. Collins (Boston) performs as well but gave some flavour yesterday already. She noted current policy may be less restrictive than expected and less easing this year than thought earlier may be warranted. Collins is part of the neutral camp and its interesting to see this side adopts a more hawkish view. The first ECB speakers after the meeting just came in as well, with Kazaks typically pioneering. He just stated that barring surprises there will be a cut in June and said that if inflation continues to fall, the ECB can continue doing so. Turning to markets, we'll look for a technically significant weekly close in US yields above the recently conquered resistance levels (eg. 4.54% in the 10y). Some more hawkish Fed speeches could prompt another test of the 5% by the 2y but a clean break ahead of the weekend is unlikely. The dollar holds the better cards against both the euro and the pound. EUR/USD is nearing the 1.07 pivot again and GBP/USD holds close to 1.25 this morning. Which will break first?\n\nNews & Views\n\nThe Bank of Korea held its policy rate stable at 3.5% for a 10th consecutive time. Economic growth is forecast to prolong its improving trend and (core) inflation to continue its slowing trend. The latter still remains high though and there are high uncertainties regarding monetary policies in major countries, FX volatility, and geopolitics. It is premature to be confident that inflation will converge to target given this high degree of uncertainty. The Board will maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance for a \"sufficient\" period of time until such confidence is established. The previous statement referred to a \"sufficiently long\" period. BoK governor Rhee ruled out a policy rate cut in H1 2024 but added that all entire board members believe that such move can't be ruled out in H2 2024 in the case that CPI slows to 2.3% at the end of this year as forecast. KRW weakness this morning adds to USD strength earlier this week. USD/KRW surged from levels around 1350 on Wednesday to 1375 currently, the highest since November 2022.\n\nGas prices spiked by 7.5% yesterday after Russian attacks on two Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities. Russia targeted similar facilities in earlier strikes. Although still operating, it highlights potential risks for storing gas should Europe's stockpiles become full. Ukraine has more storage capacity than any other European nation. The benchmark European gas future (Dutch TTF) rose to \u20ac30/MWh, matching the highest level since early February.",

Simply put, the whole town was having a party,\" he said.\n\nThe advent of mass tourism and hyper-connected societies may have since lessened the attraction but some Osaka residents still think it's a good idea.\n\nKosuke Ito, a 36-year-old doctor, said it would \"strengthen the economy\".\n\nHowever, Yuka Nakamura, 26, said she might be put off by adult entry fees ranging from 4,000 to 7,500 yen ($25 to $50) a day.",

        "text": "Hello from Tokyo. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is visiting the U.S. this week, and the cover of the latest issue of our magazine shows Kishida during an exclusive interview at the prime minister's office ahead of his trip. The cover image is the face of the publication, and our magazine team always spends a lot of time deciding on the final design.\n\nAt the suggestion of our photo editor, we decided to have the prime minister pose with a globe in his hands. Asking the head of the government to set aside time for a photo shoot was, perhaps unsurprisingly, not easy. We sent several sample photos to Kishida's office in advance so he and his staff could see what kind of images we had in mind. Fortunately, they seemed to like our idea.\n\nSpeaking of globes, one of the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's many catchphrases was \"diplomacy that takes a panoramic view of the world map.\" As Japan's longest-serving prime minister, Abe actively traveled abroad and, according to the prime minister's office, flew the equivalent of about 39.5 times around the world.\n\nSo how does Kishida, who served as a foreign minister under Abe, differ from his former boss in his diplomatic style? Based on our exclusive interview, this week's Big Story takes an in-depth look at the kind of Japan-U.S. relationship Kishida is seeking to build as the world tries to guess the outcome of the American presidential election in November.\n\nKishida's visit also included the first-ever trilateral summit among the U.S., Japan and the Philippines. The Philippines is Taiwan's geographically closest Southeast Asian neighbor and, like the democratically governed island, also faces rising tensions with Beijing in the South China Sea. Perhaps understandably, more Filipinos would side with the U.S. over China if asked to choose between the two powers, unlike many other countries in the region, according to a recent survey by a Singapore think tank.\n\nIf, like Abe, we take a panoramic view of the world map, we also need to look at what is happening in China this week. President Xi Jinping has been busy holding marathon talks with Vietnam's National Assembly chairman, Russia's foreign minister and Taiwan's former president. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also recently visited China.\n\nChina was among the first countries to begin constructing a pavilion at the site of Osaka Expo 2025, and the structure is expected to be one of the largest among the participants. The U.S. is also planning a pavilion, and according to an announcement made after the U.S.-Japan summit, Washington has -- for the first time since 1988 -- approved federal funding to support the structure's design, construction and operation. But many participating nations have not so much as raised a hammer at the site yet, and our Asia Insight explains why.\n\nOne of the many reasons for the delays in preparing for the expo is the labor shortage in Japan. This is an industrywide problem, and the Business Spotlight in this week's magazine looks at the issue from perhaps a different angle than usual. The story examines the trend of large numbers of foreigners flocking to Japan to learn about auto repair, a trade that is becoming more complex as the industry shifts to electric vehicles.\n\nNot far from my office, there is a restaurant that serves a Malay dish called nasi kandar. According to my colleague who knows a lot about Malaysia, the eatery's fare is not necessarily authentic, but after reading the Tea Leaves column in this week's magazine about mamak restaurants in Malaysia, I'm confident that you will want to try the dish.",

        "text": "Tensions escalate in the Middle East as Iran threatens Israel, leading to increased international concern. Israel emphasizes readiness for security threats, while Iran signals a measured response. Foreign ministers stress the importance of stability to avoid further escalation. The US supports Israel against threats from Iran.Russia, Germany and Britain on Thursday urged countries in the Middle East to show restraint and Israel said it was preparing to \"meet all its security needs\" in a region on edge over an Iranian threat to strike Israel.\n\nThe German airline Lufthansa, one of only two Western carriers flying to Tehran, extended a suspension of its flights to the Iranian capital and Russia warned against travel to the Middle East.\n\nIran has vowed revenge for the April 1 airstrike on its embassy compound in Damascus that killed a top Iranian general and six other Iranian military officers, ratcheting up tension in a region already strained by the Gaza war.\n\nIsrael has not claimed responsibility for the attack, but Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday Israel \"must be punished and it shall be\", saying it was tantamount to an attack on Iranian soil.\n\nThe \"imperative for Iran to punish this rogue regime\" might have been avoided had the U.N. Security Council condemned the strike and brought the perpetrators to justice, Tehran's mission to the United Nations said on Thursday.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was keeping up its war in Gaza but making security preparations elsewhere.\n\n\"Whoever harms us, we will harm them. We are prepared to meet all of the security needs of the State of Israel, both defensively and offensively,\" he said in comments released following a visit to an air force base.\n\nIran has signalled to Washington that it will respond to Israel's attack in a way that aims to avoid major escalation and it will not act hastily, Iranian sources said.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant told US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin that Israel would respond directly to any attack by Iran, Gallant's office said.\n\nConflict has spread across the Middle East since the eruption of the Gaza war, with Iran-backed groups declaring support for the Palestinians waging attacks from Lebanon, Yemen and Iraq. Tehran has avoided direct confrontation with Israel or the United States, while declaring support for its allies.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called on her Iranian counterpart Hossein Amirabdollahian to urge \"maximum restraint\" to avoid further escalation.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry told citizens they should not travel to the Middle East, especially to Israel, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories.\n\n\"Right now it's very important for everyone to maintain restraint so as not to lead to a complete destabilisation of the situation in the region, which doesn't exactly shine with stability and predictability,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a news briefing.\n\n'Potential for miscalculation'\n\nBritish foreign minister David Cameron said on Thursday he had made clear to Amirabdollahian that Iran should not draw the Middle East into a wider conflict.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the potential for miscalculation leading to further violence,\" Cameron said on X.\n\nUS State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Secretary of State Antony Blinken called counterparts including the Turkish, Chinese and Saudi foreign ministers \"to make clear that escalation is not in anyone's interest and that countries should urge Iran not to escalate.\"\n\nUS President Joe Biden said on Wednesday Iran was threatening to launch a \"significant attack in Israel\", and that he had told Netanyahu that \"our commitment to Israel security against these threats from Iran and its proxies is iron-clad\".\n\nThe US expects an attack by Iran against Israel but one that would not be big enough to draw Washington into war, a US official said late on Thursday.\n\nThe US military said on Thursday it had destroyed an anti-ship ballistic missile launched from an area of Yemen controlled by Iran-backed Houthi militia. No injuries or damage were reported to US, coalition or merchant vessels.\n\nIran is the third-largest oil producer in the OPEC group and oil prices stayed near six-month highs on Thursday.\n\nLate on Wednesday, an Iranian news agency published an Arabic report on the X platform saying the air space over Tehran had been closed for military drills, but then removed the report and denied it had issued such news.\n\nLufthansa said it would probably not fly to Tehran before April 13. Austrian Airlines said it was still planning to fly on Thursday but was adjusting timings to avoid crew having to disembark for an overnight layover.\n\nIranian air space is also a key overflight route for Emirates' and Qatar Airways' flights to Europe and North America.\n\nEmirates, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Aeroflot and Air Arabia, among the airlines that fly to Tehran, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

        "text": "The EU has put together a framework document, based on the bloc's existing and ongoing efforts, to give Ukraine lasting security commitments, according to a draft by the bloc's diplomatic service (EEAS), seen by Euractiv.\n\nThe draft document, dated 8 April, lists the EU's existing and ongoing efforts, ranging from political, military, and financial assistance to commitment to drive forward Kyiv's accession process.\n\n\"The European Union and Ukraine agree that the European Union's security commitments to Ukraine will remain in effect as Ukraine pursues its European path,\" the draft document states.\n\nEight countries -- the UK, France, Germany, Denmark, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, and Finland -- have signed bilateral security deals with Ukraine so far as part of a wider Western effort to help the country combat Russia's aggression.\n\nUkrainian officials expect more to be signed before summer, including with Romania and Poland.\n\nThe bilateral deals commit to the continued provision of military and security aid, support to develop Ukraine's defence industrial base, training Ukrainian soldiers, intelligence sharing and cooperation, and support for cyber defence.\n\nWhile falling well short of the mutual defence that would come with NATO membership, the deals would provide a stop-gap to reassure Ukraine of continued Western support.The EU's security commitments and national bilateral security commitments arrangements concluded between the bloc's member states and Ukraine \"are complementary and mutually reinforcing\", the document states.\n\nThe EU will \"facilitate coordination between member states of the European Union and cooperate with other partners on the implementation of respective security commitments\", it adds.\n\nAs with most national security deals to date, the draft document foresees the bloc to \"review the European Union's security commitments not later than ten years from the date of this statement\".\n\nContrary to some national security deals, the EU's document does not list fresh commitments or pledges but references areas where support could be expanded.\n\nThe recently created Ukraine Assistance Fund -- part of the EU's off-budget European Peace Facility (EPF) used to partially reimburse member countries for the weapons they provide to Ukraine - will have a budget of \u20ac5 billion for 2024.\n\n\"Further comparable annual increases could be envisaged until 2027,\" the document states, adding that needs \"will be driven by the evolving needs of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and complementing EU Member States bilateral efforts\".",

        "title": "Russian soldiers who quit Putin's war get no hero's welcome abroad as asylum claims surge",
        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) - If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia\u00b4s war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia\u00b4s vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nA Russian officer who goes by Yevgeny speaks during an interview at his apartment in Astana, Kazakhstan, in late 2023. He had a friend shoot him in the leg so he could get out off the frontline in Ukraine. \"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\" (AP Photo)\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I\u00b4d rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia\u00b4s fault. I don\u00b4t regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group\u00b4s head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin\u00b4s group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee - a drop in the bucket compared with Russia\u00b4s overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that\u00b4s not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It\u00b4s not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it\u00b4s proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany\u00b4s Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it\u00b4s his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it\u00b4s much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country - a healthy young man who can work - than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin\u00b4s war in Ukraine.\n\nThis late 2023 photo shows downtown Astana, Kazakhstan, where some Russian soldiers who deserted the war in Ukraine live in hiding while they apply for asylum.

        "text": "The Russian military conducted a wave of attacks on targets across the country on Thursday\n\nRussia has been forced to repel attacks on its energy facilities in recent months and must retaliate, President Vladimir Putin told his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, during talks in Moscow on Thursday.\n\nSince Kiev launched its drone campaign against Russian fuel sites, Moscow has conducted several large-scale strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which the Defense Ministry described as retaliatory.\n\nThe latest attack was confirmed on Thursday. The ministry stated that Russian forces unleashed a wave of high-precision strikes involving long-range air- and sea-based weapons and drones on energy and oil facilities across Ukraine, disrupting the work of defense-oriented enterprises and degrading military production and logistics for Kiev's frontline units. Russia insists that the attacks never target civilians.\n\n\"First of all, we assume that this is how we affect the defense industry of Ukraine, and affect it directly,\" Putin said, noting that the strikes on energy facilities in Ukraine are part of the process of \"demilitarization.\"\n\nHe stressed that Russia \"did not conduct any strikes\" during the winter for humanitarian reasons. \"We did not want to leave social institutions, hospitals, and so on without power, but after a series of strikes on our energy facilities, we were forced to respond,\" the president said, adding that Moscow is ready to engage in talks.\n\nLukashenko replied that Kiev is provoking Russia into conducting these strikes. Moscow first targeted Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the autumn of 2022, after Russia's Crimean Bridge was bombed that October.\n\nSince January, Ukraine has launched numerous long-range attacks on Russian energy facilities, including oil depots and refineries, using kamikaze drones. The Guardian reported earlier this month, citing the country's military intelligence, that these tactics are used due to the fact that Kiev has realized that it cannot defeat Russia on the battlefield.",

        "text": "Toronto: Grandmaster D Gukesh slipped from the joint top spot after suffering his first defeat, at the hands of Frenchman Firouza Alireza, but teen prodigy R Praggnanandhaa played out an easy draw with American Fabiano Caruana in the seventh round of the Candidates chess tournament here.\n\nFollowing the loss, the 17-year-old Gukesh was down to the joint second spot on four points along with Caruana and Praggnanandhaa. Russia's Ian Nepomniachtchi regained his slender half-point lead inching to 4.5 points out of a possible seven at the half-way stage following a draw with American Hikaru Nakamura.\n\nAfter a draw with Nijat Abasov, Vidit Gujrathi took his tally to 3.5 points to share the fifth spot with Nakamura while Alireza pulled himself up a little on 2.5 points to take the seventh spot. Abasov with two points is still in the last place.\n\nIn the women's section, R Vaishali seemed to have run out of steam as she suffered her third loss in the event. Tingjie Lei of China proved too good for the Indian on a day when the other three games ended in draws. Zhongyi Tan of China remained half a point ahead of the pack after drawing with closest rival Aleksandra Goryachkina of Russia.\n\nKateryna Lagno, Russia, played out a draw with Nurgyul Salimova of Bulgaria and in the other game of the day, Anna Muzychuk signed peace with India's Koneru Humpy.\n\nThe Indian challenge in the women's section might already have ended as Zhongyi stood firmly ahead on five points while Goryachkina had 4.5 points in her kitty. Lagno and Lei shared the third spot on four points each and Salimova, on three, was occupying the sole fifth position. Humpy, Vaishali and Muzychuk need a miracle in the second half of the event to make a comeback as the trio has just 2.5 points. Alireza was a bit lucky to beat Gukesh out of a London system.\n\nIt was one of those days for Gukesh when things did not go as planned and even though the Indian enjoyed a good position in the middle game, going for unwarranted complications proved costly.\n\nGukesh ended up losing a piece but his position would still have been holdable despite the material deficit. However, as things unfolded, Alireza won this race with some timely checkmate threats. Praggnanandhaa employed the French defense and it was already a surprise for Caruana who went for the advance variation.\n\nThe 18-year-old Indian did not have much trouble in maintaining the balance in the ensuing middle game as the players reached an equal endgame with no chance of a breakthrough. The draw was agreed to after 41 moves. Vidit Gujrathi came close against Abasov. The Berlin defense has been the go-to opening for the Nasik-based player and this time too, it gave him a good position after Abasov misplayed in the middle game.\n\nHowever, as it turned out, the Azerbaijani defended quite well in the latter part of the game and split the point. Ian Nepomniachtchi went for a very complicated Petroff defense as black against Nakamura and the American looked in control after gobbling up material on the queen side.\n\nWith an exchange and a pawn plus, Nakamura put up stiff defense against his vulnerable king but Nepomniachtchi won the queen eventually for three pieces to force a draw. Tingjie won in style against Vaishali, who did not have many answers against a king side attack out of an Italian opening. The Indian got a balanced middle game but the position started to drift in the Chinese favour in the middle game ultimately allowing a Knight sacrifice. The game lasted 36 moves.\n\nHumpy faced the Ruy Lopez as black against Muzychuk. The trade of queens and many pawns later, the players arrived at a theoretically drawn rook and pawns endgame where peace was signed after 40 moves. The players will get their second rest day of the event on Friday. There are seven rounds still to be played in the double round robin event that will decide the next challengers for the world championships.\n\nResults round 7 (Indians unless specified):\n\nFirouza Alireza (Fra, 2.5) beat D Gukesh (4); Hikaru Nakamura (Usa, 3.5) drew with Ian Nepomniachtchi (Fid, 4.5); Nijat Abasov (Aze, 2) drew with Vidit Gujrathi (3.5) Fabiano Caruana (Usa, 4) drew with R Praggnanandhaa (4).\n\nWomen: Tingjei Lei (Chn, 4) beat R Vaishali (2.5); Anna Muzychuk (Ukr, 2.5) drew with K Humpy (2.5); Aleksandra Goryachkina (Fid, 4.5) drew with Zhogyi Tan (Chn, 5); Kateryna Lagno (Fid, 4) drew with Nurgyul Salimova (Bul, 3).",

        "text": "The next few months will amount to Ukraine's toughest test, with a public growing exhausted of war, especially in the city of Kharkiv in the country's east, which has been particularly targeted.\n\nKrystyna Malieieva, who fled the city after Russia invaded and then returned, said the unpredictability of the attacks have struck fear into city residents, even if most don't believe the Kremlin can take a metropolis whose pre-war population was 1.5 million.\n\n\"There is very depressive mood in Kharkiv now,\" Malieieva, the owner of a family centre who returned in 2023 after a year in Croatia and the UK, said in an interview. \"People started to return last year, new restaurants opened - and now I see people are fleeing again.\"\n\nRussian forces are benefiting from a widening gap in ammunition supplies, with Moscow set to secure 6 million shells this year with ramped-up production and supplies from North Korea and Iran, according to one official.\n\nHanging above it all is the stalled US$60 billion US aid package, a victim of infighting as House Republicans demand concessions on immigration from President Joe Biden. Should those funds not come through, there is no alternative for Ukraine at its darkest moment, the officials said.\n\nFar from being able to seize back occupied territory, which was last year's objective, Kyiv's forces are struggling to hold the line on Russia's advance. President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week that Russia may be able to mobilise as many as 300,000 new troops by June 1.\n\nCongress needs to act to approve the military aid and there is no way around that, a White House National Security Council spokesperson said.\n\nThe US doesn't see any signs of an imminent breakthrough by Russian forces, a US official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But Ukraine's morale is low and the possibility of a collapse in its army can't be ruled out, another official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe destruction early Thursday of a thermal power plant some 45km south of Kyiv - the biggest producer in the region around the capital - drove home the country's vulnerability to missile strikes.\n\nZelensky called the military's lack of air defence \"the biggest challenge\" in the hours after the attack.\n\nThe demise of the Trypilska was part of a nationwide missile and drone barrage that hit targets, including plants and gas-storage facilities, in five regions. European natural gas futures rose to their highest level in over two weeks, with benchmark futures jumped as much as 7.1 per cent.\n\nRussian forces have also unleashed their firepower all along the front line and made marginal gains since capturing the eastern city of Avdiivka in February.\n\nKremlin troops are seeking to close in strategically key spots, such as the town of Chasiv Yar, west of Bakhmut in Ukraine's Donetsk region.\n\nAfter months of stalling, Zelensky and Ukrainian lawmakers have expedited contested legislation to bolster the ranks of fighting forces, approving a lower conscription age and tightened rules for the draft.\n\nA key worry is Kharkiv, which Russian forces tried and failed to seize in the opening campaign of the war.\n\nThe proximity of the city, to the Russian border makes it vulnerable to Russian shelling. Kremlin forces have pelted it with S-300 ballistic missiles and glide bombs, laying waste to swathes of residential areas and destroying nearly all local power-generating capacity.\n\nFor the first time since the invasion began, fewer than half of Ukrainians believe the country can recover all territory seized by Russia, a February survey by Kyiv-based Rating Group found. And while most of Ukrainians still believe in victory, they are increasingly questioning what it may entail.\n\nSo far there's been no mass exodus out of Kharkiv. Oleksandr Savchuk, the owner of a boutique publishing house, said the daily attacks won't force him out until Russia pulls artillery up to the city limits.\n\n\"The fact that we're here is also a form of resistance,\" he said.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON - Major U.S. airlines and aviation unions on Thursday urged the Biden administration to pause approvals of additional flights between China and the United States, citing ongoing \"anti-competitive policies of the Chinese government.\"\n\nIn February, the U.S. Transportation Department said Chinese passenger airlines could boost weekly round-trip U.S. flights to 50 starting on March 31, up from the current 35, about a third of pre-pandemic levels. U.S. carriers were authorized as well to fly 50 flights per week but are currently not using all those flights.\n\nAirlines for America, a trade group whose members include American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, and unions in a letter to the Transportation and State departments cited the \"advantage Chinese airlines receive by continuing to access Russian airspace, while U.S. carriers stopped flying through Russian airspace at the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in March 2022.\"\n\nThe letter, which was first reported by Reuters, was signed by the Air Line Pilots Association, Allied Pilots Association and Association of Flight Attendants. It called on Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to \"pause additional passenger flights between the United States and the People's Republic of China until U.S. workers and businesses are guaranteed equality of access in the marketplace, free from the existing harmful anti-competitive policies of the Chinese government.\"\n\nFlights between China and the United States - which were a point of contention during the COVID-19 pandemic - have emerged as a rare area of cooperation between the two super powers, but U.S. airlines have expressed concern about the rapid pace of increasing flights.\n\nAirlines are worried the Biden administration could boost or even double to 100 the number of weekly flights permitted by Chinese carriers.\n\nSeparately, U.S. Representative Mike Gallagher, the chair of the House select committee on China, and the panel's top Democrat, Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, urged the Biden administration in a separate letter Wednesday not to approve more flights until China abides \"by its existing bilateral agreement, and passenger demand begins to recover.\"\n\nThe lawmakers said Chinese carriers \"operate air routes at an anticompetitive commercial advantage that must not be allowed to increase without reciprocal parity in the number of U.S. carrier operated routes\" to China. It added that \"American passengers must not be exposed to unnecessary security risks by traversing Russian airspace.\"\n\nMore than 150 weekly round-trip passenger flights were allowed by each side before restrictions were imposed in early 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but until August 2023, Chinese and U.S. carriers could each fly only 12 a week between the two countries.\n\nThe number rose on Sept. 1 to 18 weekly round-trips and then to 24 per week starting Oct. 29. The USDOT approved 35 for Chinese carriers in November.\n\nReuters reported last June that newly approved Chinese flights to the United States were not overflying Russia, which would have given them a shorter flight time and fuel advantage over U.S. rivals blocked from Russian airspace.\n\n(Reporting by David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Matthew Lewis)",

No further details about the facility or the damage were immediately available.\n\nSince late March, Russia has launched multiple major attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, dealing significant damage to the Ukrainian power system and causing emergency power cuts in some regions.\n\nRussian missiles and drones destroyed a large electricity plant near Kyiv and hit power facilities in several regions on Thursday, worsening the state of an embattled energy system.\n\n(Reporting by Anastasiia Malenko; Editing by Lincoln Feast and Sharon Singleton)",

        "title": "Singapore implements stricter arms control measures in response to UN findings on Myanmar weapon trading",
        "text": "An UN special rapporteur reports that Singapore has cut weapon material exports to Myanmar by 83% following his report, which noted US$254 million in transfers from 138 Singapore-based companies to Myanmar between 2021 and 2022, significantly impacting Myanmar's military capabilities.\n\nIn a report on Friday, Al Jazeera detailed Singapore's forceful response to the United Nations' scrutiny over arms sales through its territory to Myanmar. Following the 2023 findings of Thomas Andrews, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, the city-state has significantly tightened controls on its role as a conduit for arms materials to Myanmar's military.\n\nSpeaking to the international publication, Andrews highlighted the swift and effective actions taken by Singapore, noting, \"My subsequent report to the Human Rights Council found that exports of weapons materials from Singapore to Myanmar had dropped by 83 percent. This is a significant step forward and an example of how governments can make a difference for those who are in harm's way in Myanmar.\"\n\nDespite the Singaporean Government's firm denial of involvement, Andrews's report, titled \"The Billion Dollar Death Trade,\" had earlier revealed substantial transactions totalling more than US$1 billion, with US$254 million worth of weapons materials transferred from Singapore-based companies to Myanmar from 2021 to 2022.\n\nThese companies were not specifically named in the report sections on Singapore, unlike those on China, Russia, and India. The Special Rapporteur has decided not to list the names of Singaporean entities transferring arms to the Myanmar military in order to allow time for the Singapore Government and other UN Member States to take action.\n\nIn response, the spokesperson of Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed appreciation for Andrews's efforts, stating, \"We appreciate Mr Andrews's efforts to providFe information to aid Singapore's investigations into whether any offences were committed under Singapore law.\"\n\nLast July, Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan confirmed the involvement of these entities in Parliament, noting an additional identification of 91 entities on top of an initial list of 47, all contributing to the military supply chain in Myanmar.\n\nHe further clarified that nine of these entities are no longer registered, thus unable to operate legally or conduct business in Singapore.\n\nIn September last year, two Singaporean individuals were fined a total of S$80,000 (approximately US$58,649) for their involvement in selling a sonar system that ultimately ended up with a survey centre operated by the Myanmar Navy.\n\nSingapore's decisive action has put significant pressure on Myanmar's military, particularly during a time when they are struggling to suppress a coalition of ethnic minority and majority Bamar resistance forces.\n\nThe military's woes are compounded by new conscription laws aimed at bolstering their ranks amidst battlefield losses.\n\nIn his follow-up report, Andrews mentioned, \"There was no evidence that the Singaporean government had any knowledge of the transfers that were taking place,\" indicating a significant oversight gap that Singapore has since moved to address.\n\nFurthermore, the National Unity Government (NUG) of Myanmar has lauded Singapore's efforts.\n\nNUG cabinet minister, Sasa, remarked, \"Singapore's actions have highlighted the power that ASEAN members possess to disrupt the Myanmar military junta's acts of terrorism against its own people by cutting off their access to weapons, finance, and legitimacy.\"\n\nThis news comes as the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar escalates, with over 2.5 million people displaced since the coup began in February 2021.\n\nSingapore's measures reflect a broader ASEAN divide over how to handle the crisis, with some nations advocating for engagement and others, like Singapore, taking a firmer stance against the military regime.",

        "title": "Russian soldiers who quit Putin's war get no hero\u00b4s welcome abroad...",
        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) - If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia\u00b4s war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia\u00b4s vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nA Russian officer who goes by Yevgeny speaks during an interview at his apartment in Astana, Kazakhstan, in late 2023. He had a friend shoot him in the leg so he could get out off the frontline in Ukraine. \"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\" (AP Photo)\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group\u00b4s head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that\u00b4s not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it\u00b4s proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany\u00b4s Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it\u00b4s much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It\u00b4s like a woman\u00b4s handbag, there\u00b4s so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can\u00b4t find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don\u00b4t care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny\u00b4s second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn\u00b4t in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn\u00b4t want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn\u00b4t get them back to Russia and didn\u00b4t want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can\u00b4t forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn\u00b4t want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn\u00b4t want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn\u00b4t want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he\u00b4d stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They\u00b4d already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn\u00b4t walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin\u00b4s announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people\u00b4s names.\n\nHe doesn\u00b4t know what he\u00b4ll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o\u00b4clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia\u00b4s September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nWithin hours of Putin\u00b4s September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin\u00b4s phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He\u00b4d tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They\u00b4d try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin\u00b4s draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan\u00b4s largest city, where he\u00b4d been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad\u00b4s passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I\u00b4m also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky\u00b4s \"Crime and Punishment\" - into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I\u00b4d kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that\u00b4s the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren\u00b4t in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad\u00b4s lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can\u00b4t be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don\u00b4t know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad\u00b4s application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad\u00b4s application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It\u00b4s not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn\u00b4t live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he\u00b4d left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don\u00b4t know what. And without any money in my pocket. It\u00b4s very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn\u00b4t ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston\u00b4s \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn\u00b4t afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can\u00b4t fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He\u00b4s been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn\u00b4t know what to do next.\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,\u00b4\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don\u00b4t, you\u00b4ll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow\u00b4s mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn\u00b4t find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I\u00b4m not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn\u00b4t fight with the Russian armed forces, he\u00b4d end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin\u00b4s then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow\u00b4s guts couldn\u00b4t take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What\u00b4s wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he\u00b4d been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia\u00b4s criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he\u00b4d wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn\u00b4t even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow\u00b4s eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don\u00b4t want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don\u00b4t understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what\u00b4s going on in Ukraine, and that\u00b4s it.\"\n\nHe doesn\u00b4t know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn\u00b4t. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I\u00b4d rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia\u00b4s fault. I don\u00b4t regret it.\"\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn\u00b4t have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he\u00b4d fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn\u00b4t want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they\u00b4d find something easy for him to do and he\u00b4d get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He\u00b4d been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade\u00b4s chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia\u00b4s Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division\u00b4s chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it\u00b4s his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he\u00b4s hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia\u00b4s wing,\" he said. \"I can\u00b4t say it\u00b4s as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn\u00b4t have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he\u00b4d likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease - if only for a moment - with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin\u00b4s war in Ukraine.\n\nThis late 2023 photo shows downtown Astana, Kazakhstan, where some Russian soldiers who deserted the war in Ukraine live in hiding while they apply for asylum. Overall asylum claims from Russian citizens to the U.S., France and Germany have surged since Russia's full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.

Officials said the peak should be reached in Orenburg on Thursday.\n\nThe flooding has struck Russia's Urals and northern Kazakhstan worst, though waters are also rising in southern parts of Western Siberia, the largest hydrocarbon basin in the world, and in some places near the Volga, Europe's biggest river.\n\nWater levels were also rising in Siberia's Tomsk, which sits on the Tom river, a tributary of the Ob, and in Kurgan, which straddles the Tobol river.\n\nMore than 6,000 people were evacuated in the Kurgan region. The flooding of the Tobol and Ishim rivers in Russia's Tyumen region will peak by April 23-25.

The Kremlin said Putin was devoting a significant part of his day to the floods.\n\nIn Orenburg, some residents expressed disappointment that local officials had not done enough to prepare for the annual snow melt.\n\n\"There is a lot of excitement, indignation and strong emotions that I understand and share,\" Orenburg Mayor Sergei Salmin said. \"The issue of receiving compensation and the procedure for processing payments is one of the main ones.\"",

        "title": "Despair makes young US men more conservative ahead of US election, poll shows",
        "text": "By Anthony Deutsch\n\nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A large global survey issued on Friday showed a surge in despair and disillusionment with established politics, particularly among young American men, the only U.S. population group to turn more conservative over the past decade.\n\nThe study by the international research agency Glocalities, shared with Reuters, offered context for November's U.S. presidential poll and a plethora of votes worldwide, including a European Union parliamentary election in June.\n\nIt surveyed respondents to determine their position on a scale on a scale of optimism between 'hope' and 'despair', and on another between 'control' and 'freedom' - in other words, conservatism and liberalism.\n\nOn average, the world became more liberal between 2014 and 2023, even as it became more pessimistic, according to more than 300,000 surveys in 20 countries representing nearly 60% of the global population.\n\nYoung people the world over feel especially let down by society, said Martijn Lampert, head of research at Glocalities, adding that \"the surge in despair among young adults in the U.S. far outweighs the rise in despair among young adults in EU countries\".\n\nMost strikingly, young U.S. men were the only population group in the United States or seven EU member states actually to have become more conservative since 2014 - or, in the poll's terms, to favour more control rather than freedom.\n\nIn total, 14,526 Americans were polled between 2014 and 2023, including 2,242 men aged 18-34.\n\nWorldwide, \"feelings of hopelessness, societal disillusionment and rebelling against cosmopolitan values partly explain the rise of radical right anti-establishment parties\", Lampert said, citing elections in several European countries.\n\nSocial media algorithms were magnifying the trend by drawing \"moderately conservative young men towards more extreme and radical conservative male role models and world views\".\n\nYOUNG WOMEN 'THE MOST LIBERAL GROUP IN HISTORY'\n\nThe report also highlighted a sharp difference between the world's young men and young women.\n\nBoth were worried about career prospects, financial security and education but while men aged 18-24 overtook men aged 55-70 as the most socially conservative group, women of 18-24 grew more liberal and anti-patriarchal.\n\nOn a scale where 1 represents the most conservative and 5 the most liberal, women worldwide aged 18-24 moved from 3.55 in 2014 to 3.78 in 2023 - both easily the highest for any age group.\n\nMen of the same age moved from 3.29 to 3.36. And in the U.S., men of 18-34 became less liberal, dropping from 3.48 to 3.46.\n\n\"Globally young women are likely the most liberal group in human history,\" the report said.\n\nYoung women were worried above all about social issues such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, child abuse and neglect.\n\nYoung men were more geared towards achieving social and economic status, and set store by conservative family values and competition, bravery and honour.\n\nIf the report offered a glimmer of optimism, it was among the world's men and women over 55, the only groups to become generally more hopeful over the decade, as well as more liberal.\n\nRespondents were asked 43 questions to assess where they ranked.\n\nTo gauge social values, Glocalities assessed their views about patriarchy, gender role flexibility, same-sex marriage and cohabitation before marriage.\n\nThe measurement of sentiment focused on future prospects and feelings about being let down by society.\n\nSurveys were conducted in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Britain and the U.S.\n\n(Reporting by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Kevin Liffey)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

        "text": "Drone attacks on the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in Ukraine must stop as they could pose \"a new and gravely dangerous\" stage in the war, the UN nuclear watchdog chief told his agency's 35-nation Board of Governors on Thursday.\n\nDrones attacked Zaporizhzhia, Europe's biggest nuclear power plant, on Sunday, hitting a reactor building in the worst such incident since November 2022, though nuclear safety was not compromised, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said.\n\nMoscow and Kyiv have repeatedly accused one another of targeting the plant since Russia seized it weeks after it invaded Ukraine. Both countries requested an emergency meeting of the IAEA's Board soon after Sunday's attack.\n\n\"The most recent attacks ... have shifted us into an acutely consequential juncture in this war,\" IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi told the Board gathering.\n\nHe called on the Board to \"unanimously to support the role of the IAEA in monitoring\" principles aimed at preventing an accident at the plant, including that it not be attacked.\n\nSince no draft resolutions have been submitted to the Board meeting, it is likely to boil down to an exchange of statements by the countries convening behind closed doors in Vienna.\n\n\"We are meeting today, and I will meet with the UN Security Council next week, because it is of paramount importance to ensure these reckless attacks do not mark the beginning of a new and gravely dangerous front of the war,\" Grossi said, adding: \"Strikes must cease.\"\n\nRussia's representative to international organisations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, described as a \"very serious flaw\" Grossi's failure to single out Ukraine as the guilty party.\n\n\"I get the feeling that they are afraid,\" Russian news agencies quoted Ulyanov as telling Russian journalists.\n\n\"It is simply not done to speak badly of Ukrainians because they are supposed to be the victims. An atmosphere is being created which essentially encourages the Ukrainian side to commit reckless actions, like these attacks,\" he said.\n\nBut he said he believed there would be no more incidents.\n\nThe Ukrainian statement to the meeting said the incident was part of a longstanding Russian disinformation campaign.\n\n\"But this time it is many times more dangerous, since these are not just words, but a real encroachment on the physical integrity of a nuclear facility,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Russia's attempt to pin the blame on Ukraine is a desperate effort to hide its guilt.\"",

The market is estimated to reach $$ billion by 2031.\n\nThis detailed market research report by Report Ocean include in-depth analysis of technological innovations, market trends, supply chain trends, future trends, leading players, and key developments. The report also includes additional information about other factors such as drivers, restraints and challenges faced by this market, along with an overview for each mentioned segment in the study.\n\nRequest To Download Sample of This Strategic Report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bwcc17929\n\nThe global neonatal intensive care market revenue was around US$ 2.8 billion in 2021 and is estimated to reach US$ 4.6 billion by 2031, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2% during the forecast period from 2022 to 2031.\n\nA neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is called an intensive care unit (ICU). It specializes in the treatment of sick or premature newborn infants. Neonatal refers to a child's first 28 days of life. Neonatal incubators, Infant ventilators, and infant warmers are just a few of the cutting-edge tools available in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau reports that the goods and services deficit rose from $68.7 billion in January 2023 to $70.5 billion in February, an increase of $1.9 billion. Due to a $2.7 billion increase in the goods deficit to $93.0 billion and a $0.8 billion increase in the services surplus to $22.4 billion, the goods and services deficit increased in February. The goods and services deficit has decreased this year by $35.5 billion, or 20.3% when compared to the same period in 2022. $10.8% more, or $49.5 billion, was exported. Imports cost $2.2% more, or $14.0 billion, than exports.\n\nStudy of the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the neonatal intensive care market. Government-enforced lockdowns and disruptions in the supply chain significantly affected the healthcare sector, including neonatal care. However, during the crisis, the healthcare sector focused on providing life-saving care and addressing COVID-19-related needs, mitigating some of the adverse effects on the market. While the market experienced a decline due to the global economic downturn, it is expected to stabilize in the coming years and show signs of recovery starting in 2022.\n\nRegional Insights\n\nAsia-Pacific dominates the neonatal intensive care market and is anticipated to continue its dominance during the forecast period. The region experiences increased product launches, rising healthcare costs, and has a sizable population, driving the demand for neonatal care services and products.\n\nHowever, North America is expected to experience significant growth as well.

One significant driver is the increase in the prevalence of newborn disorders and difficulties, such as overweight and underweight babies, respiratory distress, and birth abnormalities. These conditions often require specialized care and admission to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), leading to an increased demand for neonatal care products and services.\n\nRising research and development efforts focused on improving neonatal intensive care and obtaining product approvals also fuel market expansion. Ongoing advancements in medical technology and treatment protocols contribute to better outcomes for newborns, increasing the demand for innovative neonatal care products.\n\nThe rising pregnancy rates and growing concerns about newborn care are additional factors driving market growth. As more families plan for and welcome newborns, the demand for high-quality neonatal care increases. Parents and caregivers are increasingly aware of the importance of early and specialized care for newborns, leading to a higher demand for NICU services and related products.\n\nThe surge in healthcare costs and improvements in healthcare infrastructure in developing countries also contribute to market growth. As healthcare infrastructure improves, access to neonatal care services becomes more widespread. Additionally, government initiatives aimed at providing affordable high-tech healthcare facilities further boost the market by facilitating better access to neonatal intensive care.\n\nThe expansion of private hospitals and the increasing demand for modern neonatal intensive care facilities are significant drivers of market growth. The establishment of new hospitals, particularly those equipped with advanced NICUs, caters to the growing demand for specialized newborn care. The availability of these facilities ensures that more infants receive the necessary care, driving market expansion.\n\nThe study offers in-depth regional analysis of market scenarios, by analyzing previous trends and covering future forecast.

        "title": "Russian soldiers who quit Putin's war get no hero's welcome abroad as asylum claims surge",
        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "According to a new market research report published by Report Ocean, the global Natural Gas Generator Market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of $%, during the forecast period. The market is estimated to reach $$ billion by 2031.\n\nThis detailed market research report by Report Ocean include in-depth analysis of technological innovations, market trends, supply chain trends, future trends, leading players, and key developments. The report also includes additional information about other factors such as drivers, restraints and challenges faced by this market, along with an overview for each mentioned segment in the study.\n\nRequest To Download Sample of This Strategic Report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bwcc17928\n\nThe global natural gas generator market revenue was around US$ 5.7 billion in 2021 and is estimated to reach US$ 10.6 billion by 2031, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.6% during the forecast period from 2022 to 2031.\n\nA natural gas generator is a particular kind of generator that uses natural gas as its fuel rather than the more common options of petrol or diesel. They are widely utilized in nursing homes, hospitals, and other big facilities where a reliable power supply is essential. It is frequently utilized in place of gasoline-powered ones.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau reports that the goods and services deficit rose from $68.7 billion in January 2023 to $70.5 billion in February, an increase of $1.9 billion. Due to a $2.7 billion increase in the goods deficit to $93.0 billion and a $0.8 billion increase in the services surplus to $22.4 billion, the goods and services deficit increased in February. The goods and services deficit has decreased this year by $35.5 billion, or 20.3% when compared to the same period in 2022. $10.8% more, or $49.5 billion, was exported. Imports cost $2.2% more, or $14.0 billion, than exports.\n\nStudy of the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a negative impact on the natural gas market. Government-enforced lockdowns and restrictions on movement disrupted business activities and slowed down the production and distribution of natural gas generators. The pandemic's impact on industrial supply chains and reduced power demand due to business closures and slowdowns contributed to the market's decline.\n\nRegional Insights\n\nAsia-Pacific dominates the natural gas market and is expected to continue growing at the highest rate during the forecast period. This can be attributed to the region's large population and thriving industries. The rapid industrial growth in countries like India, Japan, and South Korea drives the demand for natural gas in the region.\n\nGovernment initiatives in India, in particular, promote the development of industrial facilities and encourage the use of cleaner energy sources. The shift towards reducing carbon emissions and the preference for cleaner power generation sources contribute to the increased demand for natural gas generator sets in industrial applications. As the focus on cleaner energy intensifies, the demand for natural gas generators is expected to rise in the region, further fueling market growth.\n\nMajor market segments of the Natural Gas Generator Market are:\n\nSegmentation based on Application\n\nStand-by\n\nContinous\n\nSegmentation based on Power Rating\n\nLess than 75 kVA\n\n75-375 kVA\n\nAbove 375 kVA\n\nSegmentation based on End User\n\nCommercial\n\nResidential\n\nIndustrial\n\nThe research methodology adopted by analysts to study the market include inputs derived from industry professionals across the value chain and various other secondary research methods, along with primary research as a major tool for market study.\n\nA section of the report covers research on key players moves that include pointers on new entrants, future investors and existing players.\n\nRequest a Sample of this report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bwcc17928\n\nList of major players operating in the Natural Gas Generator market:\n\nF.G.

One significant driver is the growing concern over pollution worldwide. Natural gas is considered one of the cleanest-burning fossil fuels, emitting fewer pollutants into the atmosphere compared to other fuels. As environmental awareness and the need for cleaner energy sources increase, the demand for natural gas grows, driving market expansion.\n\nThe expansion of gas-based power production and the expansion of gas infrastructure also contribute to market growth. Gas-based power generation offers cost-effectiveness and high efficiency, making it an attractive option for energy production. The development of gas infrastructure, including pipelines and distribution networks, further supports the market by ensuring a reliable supply of natural gas to consumers.\n\nGlobal urbanization and infrastructure expansion play a significant role in driving the demand for natural gas generators. As cities expand and new infrastructure projects emerge, there is an increased need for reliable and efficient power generation. Natural gas generators provide a viable solution, meeting the demand for electricity in urban areas and supporting the growth of various industries.\n\nThe study offers in-depth regional analysis of market scenarios, by analyzing previous trends and covering future forecast.

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia.

None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "title": "Ukrainian priest could face prison for 'espionage'",
        "text": "A Ukrainian priest abducted by Russian occupiers nearly a year ago could face 12 years in prison after a secret court trial for alleged espionage, contrary to international law, according to rights watchdog Forum 18.\n\nThe Rev. Kostiantyn Maksimov, 40, from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was charged with espionage under Article 276 of the Russian Criminal Code. The Russian Prosecutor's Office in occupied Zaporizhzhia announced the trial on its website on March 29.\n\nThe prosecutor's office alleges, without evidence according to Forum 18, that Maksimov used \"an internet messenger transmitted to an employee of the Ukrainian security service information with the coordinates of the deployment of Russian air defense technical equipment located in the city and district\" between April 2022 and February 2023.\n\nBefore his arrest, Maksimov was a Ukrainian orthodox priest at the Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, in Tokmak city, in Zaporizhzhia, now under Russian occupation.\n\nRussian forces stopped and detained the priest in Chongar town in May. At the time, he tried to cross the boundary line with occupied Crimea. No one had knowledge of the priest's welfare since the initial arrest 10 months ago until the announcement of the trial.\n\nPro-Russian politician Vladimir Rogov pronounced a guilty verdict regardless of the trial's outcome on his Telegram channel on March 31.\n\n\"The accomplice of the Ukrainian special services was caught transferring confidential data to his overseers in Kyiv,\" Rogov wrote of Maksimov, according to Forum 18. \"The information leak threatened the security of Russia and all residents of the Zaporizhzhia Region.\"\n\nForum 18 stated that the trial is illegal under international law because an occupying country is not allowed to enforce its own laws in occupied territory. The laws of occupation verified by several countries, including Russia, at The Hague on Oct. 18, 1907, appear to support this view. Article 43 states that when the authority of a \"legitimate power\" is passed to an occupier, it should be \"respecting, unless absolutely prevented, of the laws in force in the country.\"\n\nNo further details are known about a trial date or lawyers involved with the priest, despite Forum 18's repeated approaches to Russian authorities. An unnamed official at the Zaporizhzhia Region Prosecutor's Office refused to give details to Forum 18 about the trial date, prosecutor's name, name of the judge, or Maksimov's location.\n\nThe official said the office had \"many cases\" but \"of course\" the priest had a lawyer, though he had no further information about the attorney.\n\n\"We have no greater rights than the defense side,\" the official told Forum 18. \"Everything will be decided by the court.\"\n\nRussian occupiers disagree about the exact location of Maksimov's trial. The court hearing is at the Russian Zaporizhzhia Regional Court in Melitopol, according to Zaporizhzhia Region Prosecutor's Office.\n\nThe Crimean Supreme Court in Simferopol, however, is the real location, according to Yelena Shapovalova, head of the Bar Association in the Russian-occupied part of Zaporizhzhia Region. No trial notification appeared on the Crimean Supreme Court's website as of this writing.\n\nShapovalova declined to tell Forum 18 the name of Maksimov's appointed lawyer during the pre-trial investigation.\n\n\"That period has now ended, and the lawyer's work thus came to an end,\" she reportedly said from her office in Melitopol on Monday (April 8).\n\nShapovalova confirmed that none of the priest's relatives signed an agreement with a lawyer. She also revealed that Maksimov had been at a temporary holding center in Melitopol during the pre-trial investigation. There was no indication of his present whereabouts.\n\nThe Rev. Vladimir Saviisky, another priest from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, knew Maksimov personally and called news of the secret court trial, \"terrible.\"\n\n\"This was to be expected,\" he told Forum 18. \"The Russians threatened me with this also. Had they not deported me, I would have been sitting next to him in a prison cell.\"\n\nSaviisky reportedly endured pressure from Russian occupiers to support the Russian Orthodox Church's dominance of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church's Berdyansk Diocese.\n\nHe served as priest of St. Nicholas Church in Primorsk, an occupied town near the Azov Sea in Zaporizhzhya. Saviisky refused to sign his church over to the Russian Orthodox Church, despite several interrogations, and fled to Ukrainian-controlled territory in June.\n\nArtyom Sharlay, head of the Religious Organizations Department at Zaporizhzhia Regional Administration's Social and Political Communications and Information Policy Department, made unverified claims about Maksimov to Forum 18 in October 2023.\n\nHe said the priest opposed the Berdyansk Diocese of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church being linked to the Russian Orthodox Church, which has controlled the Diocese since May 2023.\n\nChristian Daily International has previously reported on the plight of Ukranian Orthodox priests suffering in Russian occupied parts of Ukraine.",

A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

And that is what we want to work for together with Armenia, together with Azerbaijan, that indeed we get from the point where we are to a positive outcome,\" Klaar said.\n\nKlaar added that Brussels supports the Turkey-Armenia normalization process, and he hopes the special envoys for normalization talks designated by Yerevan and Ankara will meet soon.\n\n\"My hope would be that in the near future this process would indeed move forward and show results for the sake of Armenia, for the sake of Turkey, for the sake of the region,\" he said.\n\nAs for Armenia's possible membership in the EU in the future, Klaar said it depends on political decisions made in Yerevan, Brussels, and the member states.\n\n\"There are so many elements related to this. Certainly what we are seeing right now is a strengthening of relations between the European Union and Armenia, which corresponds to the interests of the European Union, which corresponds to the interests of Armenia. How this relationship will evolve, we will have to see,\" he said.\n\nCompared to only a few years ago, the relationship between the EU and Armenia has evolved significantly, he added, but it's too early to say where things will end up.\n\nArmenia is only starting to catch up on some elements of the process that it could have achieved 10 years ago, he said.\n\n\"We are catching up on maybe lost time that we have had in our relationship,\" the diplomat said.\n\nArmenia has long been a close ally of Russia but in recent months has taken steps to distance itself from that alliance, apparently angered by what it saw as a lack of support from Moscow during the 2020 war in Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nThe Armenian government has also criticized Russian peacekeepers deployed to Nagorno-Karabakh of failing to stop Azerbaijan's lightning offensive in September last year that ended with Baku regaining control over the breakaway region that for three decades had been under ethnic Armenians' control.\n\nIn other signs of Armenia's move to distance itself from Russia, Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian said last month that his country had frozen its membership in the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), and the Armenian Foreign Ministry said on April 10 that Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan will not attend a meeting on April 12 of his counterparts from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), a Moscow-led grouping of former Soviet republics that was set up immediately after the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nThe CSTO has been at the heart of Armenia's turn away from Moscow. The Pashinian government has long criticized the CSTO for its \"failure to respond to the security challenges\" facing Armenia.\n\nAsked whether Armenia's membership in organizations like the Russian-led CSTO was an obstacle to the country's further integration with the EU, Klaar said: \"Right now we have to look at what the Armenian government and what the Armenian people want to do, where they want to go, and how they see best the development of our relations.\"\n\nA meeting last week in Brussels between Pashinian, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell represented \"a real strengthening of EU-Armenia relations,\" Klaar said, adding that the United States is there to help support the resilience of Armenia.\n\nAt the meeting the EU unveiled an aid package for Armenia in the amount of 270 million euros (about $290 million) to be made available over the next four years, with the United States pledging $65 million in additional \"development assistance\" to Armenia this year.",

Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

In February, the U.S. Transportation Department announced that Chinese passenger airlines would be permitted to increase their weekly round-trip flights to the United States to 50, effective March 31. This represented an increase from the existing 35 flights per week.\n\nU.S. carriers were also granted authorization to operate 50 flights per week, although they are currently not utilizing all of these allocated flights.\n\nThe U.S. companies are expressing concerns that the Biden administration may increase or potentially double the number of weekly flights allowed for Chinese carriers to 100.",

A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault.

Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "Washington, DC [US], April 12 (ANI): The United States' defence commitments to Japan and the Philippines are \"ironclad,\" US President Joe Biden said on Thursday as he hosted the first-ever trilateral summit between the three countries, welcoming Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr to the White House a day after the official visit of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, CNN reported.\n\nThe US-Japan-Philippines trilateral comes after the creation of groupings in the Indo-Pacific, starting with the Quad, comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan, and the AUKUS, consisting of Australia, the US and the UK, amid increasing concerns over China's military muscle-flexing in the region.\n\n\"When we stand as one, we're able to forge a better future for all,\" Biden said in the East Room of the White House Thursday.\n\nAccording to CNN, tensions between the Philippines and China have been focused on the Second Thomas Shoal, situated approximately 200 kilometres off the coast of Palawan, Philippines. In the 1990s, the Philippines intentionally grounded an aging World War II-era navy transport ship on the shoal to reinforce its territorial claim. The ship is now mostly a rusted wreckage and is manned by Filipino marines stationed on rotation.\n\nMeanwhile, China asserts sovereignty over the shoal, located within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, as part of its broader claims in the South China Sea, disregarding an international arbitration ruling.\n\nRecent clashes have occurred when Philippine attempts to resupply the forces on the ship have been met by China Coast Guard ships firing water cannons at the Philippine resupply boats, resulting in injuries to Filipino sailors and damage to the vessels, as per CNN.\n\nBiden said on Thursday, referencing the Filipino-Chinese tensions, that \"any attack on Philippine aircraft, vessels or armed forces in the South China Sea would invoke our mutual defence treaty.\"The 1951 mutual defence treaty between the US and the Philippines, the oldest of its kind in the Asia-Pacific region, obligates both nations to come to each other's defence in the event of an attack by a third party.\n\nThursday's meeting signifies the administration's ongoing efforts to address Chinese aggression, with a senior administration official expressing deep concern over China's actions in the South China Sea, and affirming at the head of the meeting that the White House is very concerned by China's actions in the South China Sea.\n\n\"What you'll see is a clear demonstration of support and resolve from both President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida that we stand shoulder to shoulder with Marcos, ready to support and work with the Philippines at every turn,\" one official said ahead of Thursday's meeting.\n\nMarcos said on Thursday that the Philippines, Japan and the United States \"meet today as friends and partners bound by a shared vision in pursuit of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.\"The three countries, Marcos added, are \"linked by a profound respect for democracy, good governance and the rule of law.\"The meeting coincides with heightened concerns over China's assertive stance towards Taiwan and the South China Sea, coupled with nuclear provocations from North Korea and its evolving ties with Russia. These concerns have prompted regional allies to draw closer to the US.\n\nJapan has emerged as a focal point in President Biden's efforts to strengthen alliances in the Indo-Pacific. Prime Minister Kishida has been viewed as a cooperative partner, having made significant adjustments to Japan's defence strategy in recent years. Additionally, Japan has provided ongoing support to Ukraine in the wake of Russia's invasion, demonstrating its commitment to international security. Kishida has pledged to increase defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP by 2037 and has bolstered Japan's counterstrike capabilities by acquiring American Tomahawk missiles.\n\nBiden hosted Marcos at the White House last year, showing his intent to reestablish strong ties with Manila that had frayed under former President Rodrigo Duterte, who sought closer relations with China.\n\n\"We're going to continue to support the Philippines military's modernization goals,\" Biden told the visiting leader during that visit, pledging the two nations \"not only share a strong partnership, we share a deep friendship, one that has been enriched by millions of Filipino Americans in the communities all across the United States.\"A highlight of Thursday's meeting was several announcements meant to bolster the Philippines.\n\nA senior administration official also said that on Thursday, the White House will be announcing a new infrastructure project in the Philippines. CNN reported earlier this week that one of the announcements will be the development of a new rail and shipping corridor between the Philippines's Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base, a move that's meant to send a clear message to Beijing.\n\nBiden briefly referenced that economic corridor on Thursday: \"It means more jobs for people across the entire region,\" he said. \"It means more investment in sectors critical to our future: clean energy, ports, railroads, agriculture and much more.\"The White House is also expected to increase the Filipino military's capability with a new infrastructure investment similar to what the US announced in India in the lead-up to the G20.\n\nIn the days leading up to the summit, the US, Japan and the Philippines along with Australia, conducted maritime military exercises near the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), after Philippine vessels had alleged \"harassment\" by Chinese ships in the South China Sea.\n\nThe senior official added that the White House will also be making announcements about \"Open Radio Access Network technology\" and that both the US and Japan will be providing millions of dollars in funding.\n\nOfficials also said they will announce an upcoming Coast Guard patrol in the Indo-Pacific that will take place \"in the coming year.\" (ANI)",

        "title": "Despair makes young US men more conservative ahead of US election, poll shows",
        "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A large global survey issued on Friday showed a surge in despair and disillusionment with established politics, particularly among young American men, the only U.S. population group to turn more conservative over the past decade.\n\nThe study by the international research agency Glocalities, shared with Reuters, offered context for November's U.S. presidential poll and a plethora of votes worldwide, including a European Union parliamentary election in June.\n\nIt surveyed respondents to determine their position on a scale on a scale of optimism between 'hope' and 'despair', and on another between 'control' and 'freedom' - in other words, conservatism and liberalism.\n\nOn average, the world became more liberal between 2014 and 2023, even as it became more pessimistic, according to more than 300,000 surveys in 20 countries representing nearly 60% of the global population.\n\nYoung people the world over feel especially let down by society, said Martijn Lampert, head of research at Glocalities, adding that \"the surge in despair among young adults in the U.S. far outweighs the rise in despair among young adults in EU countries\".\n\nMost strikingly, young U.S. men were the only population group in the United States or seven EU member states actually to have become more conservative since 2014 - or, in the poll's terms, to favour more control rather than freedom.\n\nIn total, 14,526 Americans were polled between 2014 and 2023, including 2,242 men aged 18-34.\n\nWorldwide, \"feelings of hopelessness, societal disillusionment and rebelling against cosmopolitan values partly explain the rise of radical right anti-establishment parties\", Lampert said, citing elections in several European countries.\n\nSocial media algorithms were magnifying the trend by drawing \"moderately conservative young men towards more extreme and radical conservative male role models and world views\".\n\nYOUNG WOMEN 'THE MOST LIBERAL GROUP IN HISTORY'\n\nThe report also highlighted a sharp difference between the world's young men and young women.\n\nBoth were worried about career prospects, financial security and education but while men aged 18-24 overtook men aged 55-70 as the most socially conservative group, women of 18-24 grew more liberal and anti-patriarchal.\n\nOn a scale where 1 represents the most conservative and 5 the most liberal, women worldwide aged 18-24 moved from 3.55 in 2014 to 3.78 in 2023 - both easily the highest for any age group.\n\nMen of the same age moved from 3.29 to 3.36. And in the U.S., men of 18-34 became less liberal, dropping from 3.48 to 3.46.\n\n\"Globally young women are likely the most liberal group in human history,\" the report said.\n\nYoung women were worried above all about social issues such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, child abuse and neglect.\n\nYoung men were more geared towards achieving social and economic status, and set store by conservative family values and competition, bravery and honour.\n\nIf the report offered a glimmer of optimism, it was among the world's men and women over 55, the only groups to become generally more hopeful over the decade, as well as more liberal.\n\nRespondents were asked 43 questions to assess where they ranked.\n\nTo gauge social values, Glocalities assessed their views about patriarchy, gender role flexibility, same-sex marriage and cohabitation before marriage.\n\nThe measurement of sentiment focused on future prospects and feelings about being let down by society.\n\nSurveys were conducted in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Britain and the U.S.\n\n(Reporting by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",

        "title": "Many say Biden and Trump did more harm than good, but for different reasons, AP-NORC poll shows",
        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- There's a reason why President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump are spending so much time attacking each other -- people don't think either man has much to brag about when it comes to his own record. Americans generally think that while they were in the White House, both did more harm than good on key issues.\n\nBut the two candidates have different weak spots. For Biden, it's widespread unhappiness on two issues: the economy and immigration. Trump, meanwhile, faces an electorate where substantial shares think he harmed the country on a range of issues.\n\nA new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that more than half of U.S. adults think Biden's presidency has hurt the country on cost of living and immigration, while nearly half think Trump's presidency hurt the country on voting rights and election security, relations with foreign countries, abortion laws and climate change.\n\n\"Considering the price of gas, the price of groceries, the economy -- I did very well during those four years,\" Christina Elliott, 60, a Republican from Texas, said of the Trump presidency. \"I didn't have to worry about filling up my tank or losing half of my paycheck to the grocery store.\"\n\nElliott wasn't too keen on Trump's handling of abortion and said that when it comes to the former president's rhetoric, \"He just needs to learn how to be tactful and shut his mouth.\"\n\n\"But other than that, like I said, I did very well during the Trump years,\" she added.\n\nThe polling underscores why certain issues -- such as abortion for Biden and immigration for Trump -- have been persistent focal points for each of the campaigns. The former president regularly decries the number of asylum-seekers who have arrived in the U.S. under Biden, describing the situation in apocalyptic and dark terms. And Biden has gone on the offensive against Trump on abortion, especially after this week's ruling from the Arizona Supreme Court that essentially criminalized the procedure in the state.\n\nWhen asked which president did more to help people like them, roughly one-third say Donald Trump and about one-quarter say Joe Biden. Yet 30% of adults said neither Biden nor Trump benefitted them. It's another data point reflecting an electorate that has been largely disappointed with this year's general election choices, generating little enthusiasm among key parts of the Biden and Trump political coalitions.\n\nAmericans rate Biden particularly negatively on a few specific issues. Only about 2 in 10 Americans think Biden's presidency helped \"a lot\" or \"a little\" on cost of living, and 16% say that about immigration and border security. Nearly 6 in 10 say his presidency hurt a lot or a little on these issues. Nearly half, 46%, of Americans, by contrast, say that Trump's presidency helped a lot or a little on immigration or border security. Four in 10 say it helped on cost of living.\n\nTexas resident Trelicia Mornes, 36, said she feels the Biden presidency has hurt a lot when it comes to everyday expenses.\n\n\"Now that he's in the office, the cost of living has spiked out of control, and there's nothing being done about it,\" Mornes, a Democrat, said, pointing to rising costs of rent and food. She said she believes Biden can do more, \"He just chooses to do other things.\"\n\nThe pandemic hurt Trump in terms of employment as the economy lost 2.7 million jobs under his watch. But the pandemic lockdowns also dramatically curbed inflation. At the same time, low interest rates and historic levels of deficit-funded government stimulus left many households feeling better off under Trump.\n\nComing out of the pandemic, Biden gave the economy a boost with additional aid that helped spur job gains of 15.2 million under his watch. But supply chain issues, Russia's war in Ukraine and Biden's aid package are judged by many economists as having contributed to rising inflation, hurting the Democrat's approval ratings.\n\nTrump's advantage on the cost of living and immigration is driven partially by Democrats' lack of enthusiasm about Biden's performance. About one-third of Democrats, for example, think Biden's presidency hurt on cost of living, and another third think Biden neither helped nor hurt. Just one-third of Democrats think Biden's presidency helped on cost of living. About 3 in 10 Democrats think Biden's presidency helped on immigration and border security, a similar share think his presidency hurt, and about 4 in 10 think it made no difference.\n\nNadia Stepicheva, 38, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, is unhappy with how Biden has handled immigration.\n\n\"The problem is, I really don't like illegal type of immigration,\" Stepicheva said. She thinks that people who enter the U.S., even if they come in illegally, should be allowed to work so that taxpayer dollars aren't used to care for them and house them.\n\nStepicheva said she has always leaned in favor of Democrats and the party's policies, \"But the last four years, I feel like it's getting too much in terms of money spent for immigration, forgiving all these student loans.\" She said she's torn in terms of who she will vote for this November.\n\nBut independents also rate Biden low on these issues: Nearly 6 in 10 independents say Biden's presidency has hurt the country on cost of living. About 4 in 10 independents say Biden's presidency has hurt the country when it comes to the cost of health care and relations with other countries.\n\nTrump has a different problem.\n\nThe former president doesn't have any asked-about issues where more than half of Americans think he did more to hurt things than to help, but the overall sense of harm is somewhat broader. Nearly half of Americans think his presidency did more to hurt than help on climate change, voting rights and election security, abortion laws and relations with foreign countries.\n\nCatherine Scott, a Republican who recently moved to New York from Florida, said she found Trump's approach to foreign policy particularly concerning.\n\n\"I understand that some people really admire Trump's ability to be a spitfire and just say whatever is at the top of his mind,\" said Scott, 30. But, pointing to Trump's complimentary comments toward autocrats like Russian President Vladimir Putin, Scott said, \"I don't think he has all the foresight to understand that might not always be the thing to do.\"\n\nThe best issue for both Biden and Trump overall is job creation. Trump has a small edge here: Nearly half say his presidency helped, while 36% say Biden's presidency helped. About half of Americans also think Trump's presidency helped on immigration and 4 in 10 think his presidency helped on cost of living.\n\nOn every other issue, the share of Americans who say that Biden or Trump helped the country a lot or a little is around 3 in 10 or less. But Republicans, overall, tend to see more of a benefit from Trump's presidency than Democrats do from Biden's -- even on issues where Biden has worked to highlight his victories.\n\nFor example, only about half of Democrats say that Biden's presidency has helped on climate change or the cost of health care. On abortion laws, 77% of Democrats think that Trump's presidency was at least a little harmful, but only about 4 in 10 say that Biden's presidency helped a lot or a little, and a similar share think Biden's presidency hasn't made a difference.\n\nMeanwhile, around 8 in 10 Republicans say that Trump's presidency helped on immigration and border security, creating jobs and cost of living.\n\n--\n\nThe poll of 1,204 adults was conducted April 4-8, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.9 percentage points.\n\n--\n\nAssociated Press writer Josh Boak contributed to this report.",

Ironically this means that even ZBCs and Ministers starlinks will now be disabled.\n\nKwachustan is a Crime Scene\n\nThe email itself reads:\n\n\"You are currently using Starlink in an unauthorized territory. Local telecommunication authorities have instructed Starlink to disable your services.\n\nAs described in your Terms of Service, Starlink does not guarantee when or where its Mobile or Mobile Priority Services Plans will be available. Use of such services is dependent on many factors, including obtaining or maintaining the necessary regulatory approvals which are subject to change. We regret any inconvenience this may cause you\", reads part of the message.\n\nYou may pause service and billing by following the instructions here or continue service and use your Starlink service in an area we currently serve (see map here). If you opt to pause service, you can reach out to support and we will issue a service credit for any remainder of the current billing period.\"\n\nTechzim has since determined this claim is false. A Starlink black market dealer in Zimbabwe has told us users are not at all receiving such emails from SpaceX.\n\nThe dealer, who prefers anonymity given his business, also said this particular screenshot has been making the rounds for at least 2 weeks and, until yesterday at least, the claim was that the email was received by Starlink users in DRC. \"It's the same screenshot doing the rounds.\" he said.\n\nIt's \"Yes\" and \"Not enough\" depending on who you ask.\n\nIn February, reports suggested Starlink equipment belonging to hundreds of customers had been deactivated. The kits would have been smuggled from a country like Zambia, Mozambique and Eswatini where Starlink is licensed and operating. So it is happening outside Zimbabwe for now.\n\nPeople that don't want other people using Starlink are complaining the company isn't doing enough to prevent and stop 'illegal use'. Take this Bloomberg article for example that calls the situation a \"systemic global problem\":\n\nHow they are smuggled and the sheer availability of Starlink on the black market suggests that its misuse is a systemic global problem, raising questions about the company's control of a system with clear national security dimensions.\n\nJust to be clear, the context of the Bloomberg article is Russia and the war in Ukraine. In response to questions about Russia's use of Starlink kits, the company said in February:\n\nIf SpaceX obtains knowledge that a Starlink terminal is being used by a sanctioned or unauthorized party, we investigate the claim and take actions to deactivate the terminal if confirmed.\n\nThe Starlink seller Techzim spoke to was actually worried that tweets like Kuda's (which has since been deleted) and articles like this one, will give Zimbabwe's telecoms regulator POTRAZ ideas.\n\nBut as pointed out in our article last month:\n\nStarlink cannot just pull the plug on all the kits in countries where their service is not yet approved. That's because part of their service offering is the roaming service.\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg article referenced earlier, there's a workaround Starlink users and dealers have resorted to. Apparently, the terminal can be re-registered in a different country and reactivated, then you roam with it again.\n\nIn Africa, Starlink is licensed in Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, Eswatini, Rwanda, Kenya, Nigeria and Benin.",

        "text": "\"That is also an ongoing topic, and I think that we've made significant expansion in that topic in the past year,\" she said.\n\nKvien cited several examples of defense cooperation between the United States and Armenia, including their first joint military exercise since 2008 that took place last year.\n\n\"I think that's a very important signal that the U.S. and Armenia can work together in the defense field. And we're looking for further ways that we can continue that work together. We're also going to have an advisor who can come and sit with Armenia's Ministry of Defense to help build capacity, particularly because Armenia is interested in expanding its participation in things like peacekeeping and other peaceful endeavors. And we want to be helpful to do that. So we're going to work with them on both reforming internally, how to get your Ministry of Defense up to modern standards, and then also how to do more in the peacekeeping area,\" she said.\n\nKvien also said that Washington and Yerevan have an \"ongoing discussion about what Armenia might need in the military sector.\"\n\n\"We have already agreed on a couple things, but we're continuing to have that discussion. One thing I can highlight in terms of what we've agreed to is that Armenia had asked for ambulances that are armored. And that way they can go into any potential conflict area and people will be protected. So that's something that we've already agreed to go forward with. We're working on the modalities now so we can deliver that assistance. And, as I said, we're talking about all sorts of different things, and we're trying to see where we can be helpful to Armenia in terms of its defense,\" Kvien added.\n\nCommenting on the April 5 meeting in Brussels between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinian that the parties said was focused on increasing Armenia's resilience and diversifying its economy that remains heavily dependent on Russia, Kvien said that what was highlighted during that high-level meeting showed the progress the parties have made in their relations in the last few years.\n\n\"I'll speak to the United States more than the EU, obviously, because that's what I cover. But I can say that since I arrived about a year ago, all of our relations with Armenia in just about every sector have expanded and deepened. I'm proud that we've made that much progress, and I think we'll continue to do that,\" she said.\n\nAt the meeting in Brussels the European Union and the United States promised 270 million euros (about $290 million) and $65 million, respectively, in fresh assistance to Armenia.\n\nThe high-level meeting between the West and Armenia was watched anxiously from Moscow that has accused Western powers of seeking to oust Russia from the South Caucasus region.\n\nOutlining ways in which the United States is trying to help Armenia get stronger and more independent in terms of its economy, Kvien said that cutting off all relations with any country was not what the United States was advising Armenia.\n\n\"Our view is... that the more friends, partners, allies you have, the more trade partners you have, the more export markets you have, the stronger you are, because that means no single country can hold you hostage to those relationships. So what we're trying to do is work with Armenia in areas that Armenia has identified to help it diversify its contacts, not cut off one or the other, but diversify,\" she said.\n\nSpeaking about the current tensions along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, Kvien stressed that Washington has made very clear that \"there can be no military solution to any current disagreements between Armenia and Azerbaijan.\"\n\n\"We consider whether it is ceasefire violations, very aggressive rhetoric, or whether it is disinformation that is put out into the information sphere, all of those things are unhelpful to the peace process. Our focus right now is trying to advance the peace process,\" Kvien said.\n\nThe diplomat reminded that the United States had facilitated a number of meetings between Armenian and Azerbaijani representatives last year and said Washington remained open to further facilitation.\n\n\"Lately the progress [in Armenia-Azerbaijan peace talks] has been slower, and we're hoping that it can get back on track to move more quickly ahead. It can be either under U\u2024S\u2024 facilitation, we're very happy to do that. But if both parties are comfortable with other facilitators, we're also happy to support that. What we really want to see is the agreement on all of the various details of a peace process moving forward, and we're willing to support it in any way that the two parties feel is okay to go forward in,\" the ambassador said.",

A very happy habit of late.\n\nThe current price in US dollars as we close out another working week: US$2,392. Which looks even more impressive in the Aussie variety: about a stonking AUD $3,665.\n\nYeah, they did. On the back of hotter-than-expected US inflation-related data. But that's yesterday's news. This commodity du jour is robust as hell right now, and it has some banker analysts reaching for the red pen to make adjustments to prior forecasts.\n\nFor instance, Francisco Blanch, head of Commodities and Derivatives Research at Bank of America Securities, told Yahoo Finance this:\n\n\"In the case of gold, I think there's a really big structural trend towards more gold purchases driven by the major geopolitical fracture that we have in the world today between the US and Europe on one side, and Russia China on the other. It's really been central banks not trusting central banks that has been behind the buy-the-dip mentality in the gold market.\"\n\nHe added that although the Bank of America still expects three rate cuts in 2024, gold prices could tumble if the Fed doesn't deliver that outcome.\n\n\"We are still calling for a rate cut in June, and two more in the second half of the year, so based on that, we think prices continue to go higher, but there is definitely a challenge for the gold market if the Fed doesn't cut rates this year, or as some people have claimed, if the Fed hikes rates.\"\n\nIf that happens, it'll be a \"challenge\" for most markets, one would've thought.\n\nOther Bank of America bods also said this, this week:\n\n\"Gold remains one of our favorite metals and we expect prices to average US$2,500/oz by the fourth quarter, potentially hitting US$3,000/oz by 2025. Notably, demand from central banks and China's retail buyers has been strong. If Western investors join the party on rate cuts, the yellow metal will move a leg higher; this may also be necessary, if sentiment in China improves, and less investment flows into gold.\"\n\nJohn Hathaway, managing partner with Sprott Asset Managment in the USA, has put together some analysis this week amid the surging gold prices.\n\nGold mining and exploration stock folks, particularly juniors, will probably be nodding heads sagely, as one of Hathaway's chief takeaways pertains to them.\n\n\"Gold mining stocks, which have been lackluster, are beginning to respond but they remain historically inexpensive to the gold price,\" wrote the Sprott man, referring to this Bloomberg chart among others, bearing in mind it has an American lens:\n\n\"In our view, gold mining stocks offer upside potential disproportionate to that of bullion,\" added Hathaway.\n\n\"To be sure, persistent inflation might short-circuit consensus expectations for a 2024 rate cut,\" he noted. \"However, we believe it is only a matter of time before investors discover that the Federal Reserve is trapped between a weakening economy and its inflation-fighting mandate.\n\n\"While attention is focused on interest rate cuts, at Fed Chairman Powell's last press conference, he stated that it could be 'appropriate to slow the pace of asset runoff fairly soon...if there were a significant weakening of the labor market,' a clear tilt toward QE (quantitative easing).\"\n\nThe Sprott exec also suggested that, regarding gold's continued surge, there has been more \"widespread recognition that gold bullion's strength is not a fluke and that the current level is either sustainable at current levels or that significant upside potential remains.\"\n\nSearching for a reason for that, or indeed another catalyst for continued up/right price action, he speculated that there's a growing loss of trust in the US dollar as a store of value, and indeed US Treasury bonds as a safe place to park money.\n\nLike the Bank of America analysis further above, he cites the record bank-hoarding from global central banks, which continue to gobble up the precious metal (1,037 tonnes in 2023 - an unprecedented level).\n\nAll the while, the US government debt just continues to spiral and spiral into a further abyss of dollar decay.\n\n\"Loss of trust in the US dollar as a safe and useful asset is no longer a hypothetical concern,\" writes Hathaway. \"Abandonment of the US dollar is a reality, and the pace is picking up steam. Repercussions for the financial markets and real economy are unlikely to be negligible. There are numerous potential catalysts for the general rush into gold by the investment mainstream.\"\n\nIn short, those catalysts consist of: geopolitical tension (wars/conflict), inflation and rising oil prices, potential recession, \"an impotent and mistake-prone\" Federal Reserve, and more.\n\n\"The investment public remains asleep to the risks. Yet the breakout in gold bullion could signal the possibility of a significant reset of world financial markets.\"\n\nHere's how ASX-listed precious metals stocks are performing, circa 3pm April 12:\n\nScroll or swipe to reveal table.

        "title": "US vows 'ironclad' defence of Philippines, Japan amid growing China provocations",
        "text": "Washington, DC [US], April 12 (ANI): The United States' defence commitments to Japan and the Philippines are \"ironclad,\" US President Joe Biden said on Thursday as he hosted the first-ever trilateral summit between the three countries, welcoming Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr to the White House a day after the official visit of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, CNN reported.\n\nThe US-Japan-Philippines trilateral comes after the creation of groupings in the Indo-Pacific, starting with the Quad, comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan, and the AUKUS, consisting of Australia, the US and the UK, amid increasing concerns over China's military muscle-flexing in the region.\n\n\"When we stand as one, we're able to forge a better future for all,\" Biden said in the East Room of the White House Thursday.\n\nAccording to CNN, tensions between the Philippines and China have been focused on the Second Thomas Shoal, situated approximately 200 kilometres off the coast of Palawan, Philippines. In the 1990s, the Philippines intentionally grounded an aging World War II-era navy transport ship on the shoal to reinforce its territorial claim. The ship is now mostly a rusted wreckage and is manned by Filipino marines stationed on rotation.\n\nMeanwhile, China asserts sovereignty over the shoal, located within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, as part of its broader claims in the South China Sea, disregarding an international arbitration ruling.\n\nRecent clashes have occurred when Philippine attempts to resupply the forces on the ship have been met by China Coast Guard ships firing water cannons at the Philippine resupply boats, resulting in injuries to Filipino sailors and damage to the vessels, as per CNN.\n\nBiden said on Thursday, referencing the Filipino-Chinese tensions, that \"any attack on Philippine aircraft, vessels or armed forces in the South China Sea would invoke our mutual defence treaty.\"The 1951 mutual defence treaty between the US and the Philippines, the oldest of its kind in the Asia-Pacific region, obligates both nations to come to each other's defence in the event of an attack by a third party.\n\nThursday's meeting signifies the administration's ongoing efforts to address Chinese aggression, with a senior administration official expressing deep concern over China's actions in the South China Sea, and affirming at the head of the meeting that the White House is very concerned by China's actions in the South China Sea.\n\n\"What you'll see is a clear demonstration of support and resolve from both President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida that we stand shoulder to shoulder with Marcos, ready to support and work with the Philippines at every turn,\" one official said ahead of Thursday's meeting.\n\nMarcos said on Thursday that the Philippines, Japan and the United States \"meet today as friends and partners bound by a shared vision in pursuit of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.\"The three countries, Marcos added, are \"linked by a profound respect for democracy, good governance and the rule of law.\"The meeting coincides with heightened concerns over China's assertive stance towards Taiwan and the South China Sea, coupled with nuclear provocations from North Korea and its evolving ties with Russia. These concerns have prompted regional allies to draw closer to the US.\n\nJapan has emerged as a focal point in President Biden's efforts to strengthen alliances in the Indo-Pacific. Prime Minister Kishida has been viewed as a cooperative partner, having made significant adjustments to Japan's defence strategy in recent years. Additionally, Japan has provided ongoing support to Ukraine in the wake of Russia's invasion, demonstrating its commitment to international security. Kishida has pledged to increase defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP by 2037 and has bolstered Japan's counterstrike capabilities by acquiring American Tomahawk missiles.\n\nBiden hosted Marcos at the White House last year, showing his intent to reestablish strong ties with Manila that had frayed under former President Rodrigo Duterte, who sought closer relations with China.\n\n\"We're going to continue to support the Philippines military's modernization goals,\" Biden told the visiting leader during that visit, pledging the two nations \"not only share a strong partnership, we share a deep friendship, one that has been enriched by millions of Filipino Americans in the communities all across the United States.\"A highlight of Thursday's meeting was several announcements meant to bolster the Philippines.\n\nA senior administration official also said that on Thursday, the White House will be announcing a new infrastructure project in the Philippines. CNN reported earlier this week that one of the announcements will be the development of a new rail and shipping corridor between the Philippines's Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base, a move that's meant to send a clear message to Beijing.\n\nBiden briefly referenced that economic corridor on Thursday: \"It means more jobs for people across the entire region,\" he said. \"It means more investment in sectors critical to our future: clean energy, ports, railroads, agriculture and much more.\"The White House is also expected to increase the Filipino military's capability with a new infrastructure investment similar to what the US announced in India in the lead-up to the G20.\n\nIn the days leading up to the summit, the US, Japan and the Philippines along with Australia, conducted maritime military exercises near the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), after Philippine vessels had alleged \"harassment\" by Chinese ships in the South China Sea.\n\nThe senior official added that the White House will also be making announcements about \"Open Radio Access Network technology\" and that both the US and Japan will be providing millions of dollars in funding.\n\nOfficials also said they will announce an upcoming Coast Guard patrol in the Indo-Pacific that will take place \"in the coming year.\" (ANI)",

        "text": "A three-day joint naval exercise by the US, Japanese and South Korea at the East China Sea amid tension from China and North Korea. (AP)A US carrier strike group led by the USS Theodore Roosevelt has held a three-day joint exercise with its allies Japan and South Korea as US President Joe Biden met for talks with leaders from Japan and the Philippines at the White House. The dueling military and diplomatic maneuvers are meant to strengthen the partners' solidarity in the face of China's aggressive military actions in the region.\n\nA number of US and South Korean guided missile destroyers and a Japanese warship joined the April 10-12 drill in the disputed East China Sea, where worries about China territorial claims are rising. The Associated Press was one of several news organizations allowed a front-row look at the drills.\n\nRear Adm. Christopher Alexander, commander of Carrier Strike Group Nine, said the three nations conducted undersea warfare exercises, maritime interdiction operations, search and rescue drills and work focused on communication and data sharing. He told journalists Thursday on the Roosevelt that these drills would help improve communication among the United States and its allies and \"better prepare us for a crisis in the region.\"\n\nF/A-18E Super Hornet combat jets took off from the carrier's flight deck, which also had anti-submarine MH-60R Seahawk helicopters. Journalists were flown more than an hour from Kadena Air Base, the hub of US Pacific air power. Kadena is on Japan's southern island of Okinawa, which is home to about half of the 50,000 American troops stationed in Japan.\n\n\"It is a busy time; there is a lot going on in the world,\" Alexander said. \"The significance of this exercise is we have three like-minded countries, three like-minded navies that believe in peace, security and stability in the western Pacific.\"\n\nThe participation of Japan and South Korea was another sign of improving ties between the sometimes wary neighbors. The two US allies' relationship has often been strained by the memory of Japan's half-century colonization of the Korean Peninsula. Washington has been pressing them to cooperate so the three partners can better deal with threats from China and North Korea.\n\nThis week's huge parliamentary election defeat of the governing party of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has sought better relations with Japan, could constrain his Japan-friendly efforts, but experts believe ties will remain stable.\n\nThe latest naval exercise is part of Biden's work to deepen security and diplomatic engagement with Indo-Pacific nations. Biden invited Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos to the White House for their first trilateral talks Thursday, and has declared that the US defense commitment to the Pacific allies is \"ironclad.\"\n\nTensions between China and the Philippines have risen over repeated clashes by the two nations' coast guard vessels in the disputed South China Sea. Chinese coast guard ships also regularly approach disputed Japanese-controlled East China Sea islands near Taiwan.\n\nBeijing has defended its operations in the South China Sea and blamed the United States for creating tensions. China's President Xi Jinping had a series of talks this week with senior officials from Vietnam, Russia and Taiwan.\n\nThe US-Japan-South Korea naval exercises follow four-way drills held in the South China Sea, where Japan joined the United States, Australia and the Philippines. Participants carefully avoided mentioning China and said they were holding the exercises to safeguard a peaceful and stable Indo-Pacific.\n\nAn area of long-simmering disputes, the South China Sea serves a key sea lane for global trade. Concerned governments include Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Taiwan.",

        "text": "\"All European countries are arming themselves, and we must do the same,\" President Aleksandar Vucic said in March.\n\n\"Even much more than the others, to stay intact and be able to dissuade possible aggressors,\" he said.\n\nSerbia has continued to purchase weapons from China and Russia after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nIn February, the Serbian president proudly presented his latest acquisitions, Russia's Repellent anti-drone system as well as Chinese drones.\n\nHe said Serbia would start producing its own explosive drones by the end of the year.\n\n\"Serbia acquires weapons and military equipment both from the East and the West,\" the country's defence ministry told AFP in March, responding to a question about its purchases.\n\nBelgrade is \"opting for those whose characteristics will improve the capabilities of the Serbian armed forces\", it said.\n\nSerbia's annual military budget has tripled in the past decade to reach 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion).\n\nThe amount exceeds the combined budgets of the other five Western Balkan nations -- Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro.\n\nFrom 2014 until this year, Serbia spent 2.7 billion euros ($2.9 billion) on arms purchases. They included the 2019 acquisition of China's FK-3 air-defence system as well as Russian Mi-17 and Mi-35 helicopters and Pantsir anti-aircraft systems.\n\nIn February, Vucic hinted that Serbia was ready to invest three billion euros for a possible purchase of French Rafale planes.\n\nDuring a visit to Paris earlier this week he went even further.\n\n\"I believe we have reached concrete agreements concerning the purchase of Rafales,\" he said.\n\n\"I expect the contract to be signed within the next two months, in the presence of the French president, which is extremely important for our country.\"\n\nDassault Aviation, which makes the planes, refused to comment Monday on a possible sale of its jets to Serbia.\n\nThe sale would raise questions, given Vucic's closeness to Russia.\n\n\"It would be ridiculous for Paris, on the one hand, to mention sending troops to Ukraine, and on the other, to sell an extremely sophisticated weapon to one of Russia's closest allies\", political scientist Jasmin Mujanovic said.\n\nSince Russia's aggression on Ukraine in February 2022, Belgrade has not joined any sanctions against Russia.\n\nSerbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic visited Moscow in late March, an opportunity, according to Belgrade, to improve the \"traditionally friendly ties between Serbia and Russia\".\n\nThe sale of Rafales to a Russian ally \"would be worrying, as it would allow information to leak to China and Russia\", Mujanovic told AFP.\n\nThe fighter jet, which has been operational since 2004 and is scheduled to fly until 2060s, is the French defence industry's export spearhead.\n\nSeven countries -- Egypt, Qatar, India, Greece, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates and Croatia -- either fly Rafales or have signed deals to acquire them.\n\nAccording to the Serbian defence white paper published last year, the \"biggest security challenge\" for the country is Kosovo, its former province that proclaimed independence in 2008, a decade after a war that claimed 13,000 lives.\n\nIf the Rafale deal goes ahead \"you could see French fighter jets used to intimidate Kosovo,\" Mujanovic said.\n\nElsewhere in Serbia's neighbourhood, Albania inaugurated a NATO-backed airbase in March, while Croatia bought 12 used Rafale planes and is considering reintroducing compulsory military service. Both Albania and Croatia are NATO members.\n\nKosovo meanwhile has announced a $75 million deal for US Javelin anti-tank missiles.\n\nAdnan Cerimagic, a researcher with the European Stability Initiative (ESI) think-tank, pointed to the \"European, even global, trend towards increasing military capacities\" and the \"dominant narrative in Serbia, which speaks of the duty to prepare for conflict\".\n\n\"Difficult days lie ahead for Serbia,\" Vucic wrote in a viral Instagram post on March 26, citing \"news that directly threatens our vital national interests\", without elaborating.\n\n\"It will be difficult. We will fight. Serbia will win,\" the president wrote.",

        "title": "Russian soldiers who quit Putin's war get no hero's welcome abroad as asylum claims surge",
        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "text": "A large global survey issued on Friday showed a surge in despair and disillusionment with established politics, particularly among young American men, the only U.S. population group to turn more conservative over the past decade.\n\nThe study by the international research agency Glocalities, shared with Reuters, offered context for November's U.S. presidential poll and a plethora of votes worldwide, including a European Union parliamentary election in June.\n\nIt surveyed respondents to determine their position on a scale on a scale of optimism between 'hope' and 'despair', and on another between 'control' and 'freedom' - in other words, conservatism and liberalism.\n\nOn average, the world became more liberal between 2014 and 2023, even as it became more pessimistic, according to more than 300,000 surveys in 20 countries representing nearly 60% of the global population.\n\nYoung people the world over feel especially let down by society, said Martijn Lampert, head of research at Glocalities, adding that \"the surge in despair among young adults in the U.S. far outweighs the rise in despair among young adults in EU countries\".\n\nMost strikingly, young U.S. men were the only population group in the United States or seven EU member states actually to have become more conservative since 2014 - or, in the poll's terms, to favour more control rather than freedom.\n\nIn total, 14,526 Americans were polled between 2014 and 2023, including 2,242 men aged 18-34.\n\nWorldwide, \"feelings of hopelessness, societal disillusionment and rebelling against cosmopolitan values partly explain the rise of radical right anti-establishment parties\", Lampert said, citing elections in several European countries.\n\nSocial media algorithms were magnifying the trend by drawing \"moderately conservative young men towards more extreme and radical conservative male role models and world views\".\n\nYOUNG WOMEN 'THE MOST LIBERAL GROUP IN HISTORY'\n\nThe report also highlighted a sharp difference between the world's young men and young women.\n\nBoth were worried about career prospects, financial security and education but while men aged 18-24 overtook men aged 55-70 as the most socially conservative group, women of 18-24 grew more liberal and anti-patriarchal.\n\nOn a scale where 1 represents the most conservative and 5 the most liberal, women worldwide aged 18-24 moved from 3.55 in 2014 to 3.78 in 2023 - both easily the highest for any age group.\n\nMen of the same age moved from 3.29 to 3.36. And in the U.S., men of 18-34 became less liberal, dropping from 3.48 to 3.46.\n\n\"Globally young women are likely the most liberal group in human history,\" the report said.\n\nYoung women were worried above all about social issues such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, child abuse and neglect.\n\nYoung men were more geared towards achieving social and economic status, and set store by conservative family values and competition, bravery and honour.\n\nIf the report offered a glimmer of optimism, it was among the world's men and women over 55, the only groups to become generally more hopeful over the decade, as well as more liberal.\n\nRespondents were asked 43 questions to assess where they ranked.\n\nTo gauge social values, Glocalities assessed their views about patriarchy, gender role flexibility, same-sex marriage and cohabitation before marriage.\n\nThe measurement of sentiment focused on future prospects and feelings about being let down by society.\n\nSurveys were conducted in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Britain and the U.S.",

        "text": "Israel was on alert Thursday after its arch foe Iran threatened reprisals over a strike in Syria this month that killed two Iranian generals, and as the war against Hamas ground on in Gaza.\n\nDays after Israel strengthened its air defenses and paused leave for combat units, the United States also warned of the risk of an attack by Iran or its allied groups at a time when Middle East tensions have soared.\n\nIran is \"threatening to launch a significant attack on Israel,\" US President Joe Biden said Wednesday, pledging \"ironclad\" support for its top regional ally despite diplomatic tensions over Israel's military conduct in Gaza.\n\nIsrael was widely blamed for an April 1 attack that destroyed Iran's consulate building in Damascus and killed seven members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including two generals.\n\nIran's supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, on Wednesday warned that Israel \"must be punished and will be punished\", days after one of his advisors had said that Israeli embassies are \"no longer safe\".\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz swiftly replied to Khamenei on social media site X that \"if Iran attacks from its territory, Israel will respond and attack Iran\".\n\nBiden said later Wednesday that he had told Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu that \"our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad\".\n\n\"Let me say it again -- ironclad. We're going to do all we can to protect Israel's security.\"\n\nThe Axios news site reported that US Central Command chief Michael Kurilla was set to visit Israel to discuss the situation with Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nGerman airline Lufthansa said it had suspended flights to and from Tehran, probably until Thursday, \"due to the current situation in the Middle East\".\n\nAnd Russia warned its citizens to refrain from traveling to Israel, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories.\n\nIsrael and the United States have long faced off against Iran and the so-called \"Axis of Resistance\" coalition of militant groups based in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.\n\nThe Syria strike killed Iranian IRGC Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who led the foreign operations wing the Quds Force in Syria and Lebanon.\n\nGaza truce talks\n\nRegional tensions have been stoked by the Gaza war which broke out after Hamas launched their October 7 attack against Israel, which left 1,170 people dead, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.\n\nPalestinian Hamas also took about 250 hostages, 129 of whom remain in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli army says are dead.\n\nIran has said it had no advance knowledge of the October 7 attack but has hailed the assault against its decades-old enemy.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 33,482 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nThe Israeli military reported overnight operations in central Gaza which had also involved its navy and air force \"to eliminate terrorist operatives\".\n\nMuch of the long blockaded territory has been reduced to a bomb-cratered wasteland of destroyed buildings with yet more bodies feared under the mountains of rubble.\n\nAn Israeli siege has deprived Gaza's 2.4 million people of most food, water, fuel, medicines and other basic supplies, the dire shortages only alleviated by sporadic aid deliveries.\n\nIsraeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz said on Wednesday that \"Hamas is defeated\" militarily but pledged to keep fighting \"what remains of it\" in the years to come.\n\nAn Israeli air strike on Wednesday killed three sons of Hamas's Qatar-based leader Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nHaniyeh's brother Nahed told AFP inside Gaza that their family are \"in the same situation\" as other Gazans.\n\n\"There is no difference between the sons of leaders and the sons of the people,\" he said.\n\nHaniyeh insisted that his sons' deaths would not influence the group's position in ongoing talks in Cairo on a possible temporary ceasefire and hostage release deal.\n\nThose talks, which started Sunday, have brought no signs of a breakthrough on a plan presented by US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators, which Hamas said it was studying.\n\nBiden said that \"it's now up to Hamas, they need to move on the proposal that's been made\".\n\n'Destabilizing Middle East'\n\nWashington has also ramped up pressure on Netanyahu to agree to a truce, increase aid flows and abandon plans to invade the territory's far-southern city of Rafah.\n\nAbout 1.5 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah, the last Gazan city yet to face a ground incursion.\n\nBiden labeled Netanyahu's handling of the war a \"mistake\" in an interview broadcast on Tuesday.\n\nWashington's tougher line has brought some results, the US Agency for International Development said.\n\nRecent days had seen a \"sea change\" in aid deliveries, said USAID administrator Samantha Power, although she insisted Israel needs to do more.\n\nGallant promised Israel would \"flood Gaza with aid\", using a crossing point on its border with Gaza, streamlined checks and two new routes organized with Jordan.\n\nHe said they expected to hit 500 aid trucks entering Gaza a day, the average pre-war level.\n\nIsrael has faced a chorus of international criticism over its handling of the war.\n\nSpain is among several Western nations, including Ireland and Australia, to have suggested they would recognize a Palestinian state in the near future as a starting point for wider peace talks.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez warned that Israel's \"disproportionate response\" in Gaza risked \"destabilizing the Middle East and, as a consequence, the entire world\".\n\nIsrael's foreign ministry slammed Ireland's new prime minister Simon Harris for not mentioning the hostages held in Gaza during a speech to parliament.\n\nThe ministry charged that \"after the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust... there are those in Ireland who persist on being on the wrong side of history\".",

Officials warned the river would rise further.\n\nThe flooding has struck Russia's Urals and the northern Kazakhstan worst, though waters are also rising southern parts of Western Siberia, the largest hydrocarbon basin in the world, and in some places near the Volga, Europe's biggest river.\n\nWater levels were also rising in Siberia's Tomsk, which sits on the Tom River, a tributary of the Ob, and in Kurgan, which straddles the Tobol river.\n\nAfter the Ural burst through dam embankments in Orsk, upstream from Orenburg, on Friday, some residents expressed anger over how local officials had handled the situation, demanding greater compensation and begging for help from President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin was being updated regularly on the situation but had no current plans to visit the area while emergency services tried to deal with rising waters.\n\nIn Orenburg, some residents expressed disappointment that local officials had not done enough to prepare for the annual snow melt.\n\n\"There is a lot of excitement, indignation and strong emotions that I understand and share,\" Orenburg Mayor Sergei Salmin said. \"The issue of receiving compensation and the procedure for processing payments is one of the main ones.\"\n\nSNOW MELT\n\nSpring flooding is a usual part of life across Russia - which has an area equal to the United States and Australia combined - as the heavy winter snows melt, swelling some of mighty rivers of Russia and Central Asia.\n\nThis year, though, a combination of factors triggered unusually severe flooding, according to emergency workers.\n\nThey said soils were waterlogged before winter and then was frozen under deep snow falls which melted very fast in rising spring temperatures and heavy rains.\n\nClimate researchers have long warned that rising temperatures could increase the incidence of extreme weather events, and that heavily forested Russia is of major importance in the global climate equation.\n\nIn Kurgan, a region which straddles the Tobol river, water levels rose in Zverinogolovkoye beyond the critical 10 meter (33 foot) mark, said Governor Vadim Shumkov who was shown visiting evacuated families.\n\nKazakhstan has been badly hit.\n\nThe emergencies ministry said on Thursday morning that the number of evacuees stood at over 97,000, unchanged from Wednesday, and a state of emergency remained in effect in eight regions of the country.\n\nEmergency workers have removed 8.8 million cubic meters (310 million cubic feet) of water from flooded areas, the ministry said. The Kazakh government also said movement was restricted on hundreds of kilometers of roads in the Aktobe, Akmola, Atyrau, Kostanai, Mangistau and North Kazakhstan regions.",

        "title": "How Turkish Sanctions Against Israel Will Impact Bilateral Trade - Conservative Angle",
        "text": "Turkey's decision to halt the export of 54 products to Israel in response to its war on Gaza isn't likely to have far-reaching results, since both countries' economies are complementary in nature rather than central to each other.\n\nThe Turkish trade ministry announced earlier this week that Ankara would continue to implement the restrictions as long as Israel denies uninterrupted flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza Strip, citing UN Security Council decisions and an International Court of Justice (ICJ) preliminary judgment against Israel's conduct in the coastal enclave. The export restrictions encompass items such as aluminium wire, steel, cement, construction materials, granite, chemicals, pesticides, engine oils, jet fuel and bricks.\n\nBefore the war, Turkish-Israeli ties had been steadier than they had been for years. After years of tensions over Palestine, the two normalized relations in 2022. Yet, while Turkey and Israel quarreled over the past decade, and even stopped cooperating with each other, trade had never been interrupted. In fact, it flourished over time.\n\nThe Turkish public has been outraged at Israel's actions in Gaza, where reportedly more than 33,000 Palestinians have been killed in six months. Lists of ships carrying goods to Israel circulated on social media as Israel's onslaught grew. People also highlighted companies close to the Turkish government that continued commercial relations with Israel during the war.\n\nEven though there is no evidence to back claims that Turkey sold weapons to Israel, the controversy was stoked by a small quantity of hunting gear or hunting equipment parts being found among the exports. They were broadly classified by the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK) as \"weaponry\".\n\nIn response to this domestic pressure and serious setbacks for the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in local elections last month, the government decided to act against Israel.\n\nTies have been cut on the Israeli side, too. In October, several Israeli supermarket chains halted imports from Turkey in response to Ankara's critical stance on the Gaza war. Israeli food company Strauss in December changed the packaging for one of its most well-known products, Elite Turkish coffee, adding an Israeli flag and patriotic slogans.\n\nAn important market\n\nBut is the trade between the two countries vital? Many say no, but Israel is nonetheless an important export market for Ankara. Turkey's exports to Israel were worth $5.4bn in 2023, or 2.1 percent of its total exports, according to official data.\n\nAlthough bilateral trade has dropped by 33 percent since the October 7 Hamas-led attack, it has nonetheless continued and exports to Israel have increased each month in 2024 so far. Both countries have had a free trade deal in place since 1996 and there have been no tariffs on certain products since 2000, which has enabled major increases in bilateral trade, largely favouring Turkey.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2023, trade between the two countries nearly tripled. By the end of that period, Turkey had become the fifth-largest supplier of imported goods to Israel, while Israel ranked as Turkey's tenth-largest export market, based on data from the Central Bureau of Statistics.\n\nTurkey exported steel, automotive industry products, chemicals, ready-made clothing and apparel, electricity and electronics, cement, glass, ceramics and soil products, furniture, paper, and forestry to Israel, according to a report published by the Turkey Exporters Assembly covering the period between 2011 and 2020.\n\n\"The economies are complementary but not intertwined,\" Gallia Lindenstrauss, a senior research fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), told Middle East Eye. \"Turkey can find also substitutes to what it imports from Israel, and anyhow, of the bilateral trade, three-quarters are Turkish exports to Israel and only one-quarter is Israeli exports to Turkey.\"\n\nTrade with Israel has traditionally been highly advantageous for Turkey, which enjoyed a trade surplus of $3.9bn last year. Israel serves as a significant market for Turkish steel, purchasing 726,000 tonnes last year. This figure constitutes over 20 percent of Turkey's total steel exports. The ban is expected to significantly affect these exports.\n\nIn terms of dependence on imports, Israel heavily relies on Turkish cement, with imports from Turkey making up 29 percent of Israel's total cement imports last year. Additionally, Turkish imports represent about 11 percent of Israel's total plastic and rubber products, and around 10 percent in textiles.\n\nSources familiar with the construction industry told Israeli news outlet Mako that the new restrictions were expected to increase the prices of apartments and rent in the country if they are implemented. \"In terms of long-term repercussions, the fact the Turkey halts construction materials when these are needed to repair damaged houses in the south and north of Israel because of rockets and other damage will likely taint relations also in the future,\" Lindenstrauss said.\n\n\"Also, while anyhow there were question marks regarding a possible gas pipeline between Israel and Turkey, these export restrictions in a time of war will be a big warning sign not to proceed with the pipeline idea.\"\n\nImpact on Palestine\n\nTurkey's decision to restrict exports to Israel likely has an impact on Palestine as well. \"Israel has complete control over the border crossings as Palestinian imports arrive at Haifa or Ashdod seaports, and the goods are then transported to Palestinian territories via trucks,\" Rashad Yousef, director of policies and planning at the Palestinian Ministry of National Economy, told Anadolu Agency.\n\nYousef added that Palestinian-Turkish trade volume in 2022 exceeded $900m, representing a 12 percent increase over 2021. He also said that the main Turkish exports to Palestine are iron, wood, vegetable oil, tobacco, food products and items from the plastic industries.\n\n\"If we exclude Israel, Turkiye is the largest source of goods and products in the Palestinian market,\" Yousef said. However, there are ways to continue to trade with Israel by rerouting trade through third countries, as the Ukraine war has proved following western sanctions on Russia.\n\nIsraeli importers are mulling bringing in Turkish goods via Slovenian ports Koper or Ljubljana, according to an Israeli report. \"But still, the economic relations were what kept the relations going even in times of political crisis, so it is regrettable we have reached this point,\" adds Lindenstrauss.\n\n\"And despite it having been a painful step, I don't see it in itself changing Israel's policy - the pressures from the White House are much more significant.\"",

        "title": "Russian soldiers who quit Putin's war get no hero's welcome abroad as asylum claims surge",
        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

A U.N. monitoring mission recorded a 20% increase in civilian casualties in March compared to February.\n\n\"Since our last briefing to this Council almost a month ago, Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities and towns have become a daily destructive pattern. This includes intense and systematic targeting of Ukrainian energy infrastructure across the country,\" Jenca said.\n\n\"We are appalled by the increase in civilian casualties as a result of these relentless attacks.\"\n\nJenca noted that in March alone, 57 children were killed or wounded, doubling the February numbers. Since February 2022, the U.N. has recorded 10,810 civilians killed, including 600 children, and 20,556 civilians injured, among which 1,357 were children.\n\nThe U.N. official denounced Russia's attacks as \"unacceptable\" and called for \"lasting and comprehensive peace in Ukraine, in line with the (U.N.) Charter, international law and resolutions of the General Assembly, respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\"\n\nJenca also appealed to Russia to grant full access to U.N. monitoring missions in the occupied territories of Ukraine.\n\nFinally, the official noted that hostilities are spreading outside of Ukraine's borders \"with regular cross-border strikes into the Russian Federation.\"\n\nRecent months saw a campaign of drone strikes targeting Russian oil refineries and industrial facilities. In March, anti-Kremlin Russian militias carried out raids from Ukraine into Russia's border regions of Kursk and Belgorod.",

A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.

He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "title": "Anna Breman: New research on the psychology of inflation valuable when addressing monetary policy challenges",
        "text": "\"Households' inflation expectations tend to be overlooked in the monetary policy analysis, as they are often higher than measured inflation. However, new research shows that households' inflation expectations are important. Households' expectations affect consumption, investment and saving, factors that are important both for inflation and the transmission of monetary policy and therefore matter for monetary policy both in the short and longer term\", Breman explains.\n\nResearch in behavioural economics highlights the tendency of households to attach more importance to rising prices than to falling ones, and of their perception of inflation being more affected by prices of goods they frequently buy, such as energy and food, than by other prices. These prices rose particularly rapidly after the pandemic and Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine. Behavioural economics research also emphasises that households' perception of fairness can influence companies' pricing. Households seem to be more willing to accept price increases caused by higher costs than higher demand. This may have allowed companies to increase their consumer prices more in recent years, further fuelling inflation.\n\nThe research also indicates that dramatic events such as the rapid and sharp rise in inflation in recent years can affect people's economic decisions over a long period of time.\n\n\"Now that an entire generation has experienced a period of high inflation for the first time, will households and businesses act differently in the future?\" Breman asks.\n\nThere is also a risk that inflation peaks will become more frequent, in which case household perceptions may have an even greater impact.\n\n\"It is positive that inflation has fallen from high levels and that the inflation outlook is favourable. At our last monetary policy meeting in March, my assessment was that the policy rate could probably be cut in May or June. However, a smooth return to sustainably low and stable inflation should not be taken for granted. Monetary policy therefore needs to be characterised by a learning approach, with preparedness to adjust the policy rate as we gradually work out which rate level is compatible with sustainably low and stable inflation.\n\n\"With new research on how households perceive inflation and form their inflation expectations, we can better understand and address the challenges facing monetary policy in a turbulent world,\" she concludes.",

        "text": "Eastern Europe is the graveyard of empires. Rome failed on the Danube, Napoleon on the Dnieper. The epic struggle between the empires of Austria, Russia and Turkey in the first world war ended with the destruction of all three and the fragmentation of eastern Europe, giving rise to the word 'Balkanisation'. Driving through the Balkans today, I am continually reminded that history has no full stops. Every empire leaves its ghosts to haunt its successors.\n\nVienna, like London, is an imperial city without an empire. The ethnic antagonisms of the Balkans, which provoked the first world war, survived to divide Yugoslavia in the second and then destroy it in the 1990s. The region still wears the robes of the past. On monumental gateways, distance tables carved in stone still show the route to the old imperial capital. In Ljubljana, the mansions of the Austrian nobility and grand public buildings are instantly recognisable from the days when it was the Habsburg city of Laibach. More than a thousand mosques built by the Ottoman Turks survive in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Along the Adriatic coast, the lion of St Mark smiles down at us from castles, city gates and town halls built by the predatory empire of Venice. Even the short-lived communist despotisms have left their calling card in the shape of brutal concrete office blocks and bleak housing developments which look as if they will last forever. Empires leave behind them an enigmatic Cheshire Cat smile. They rarely vanish into the sand like the kingdoms of Shelley's 'Ozymandias'.\n\nIn intensely Catholic Croatia, the vast majority of cohabiting couples do actually get married. The divorce rate is rising, but is still low. Marriage is not just celebrated, it is a public affair. The boozing begins in the early afternoon, when the groom's guests gather in their glad rags at his home and the bride's at hers. The two groups process to a public square near the church. More boozing. Then they march off in procession to the church for the service, and back to the square for yet more boozing. A big dinner follows with more drink and loud merriment into the early hours. One touch, which would be regarded as poor taste in England, is a strong patriotic element which brings to these occasions something of the atmosphere of Last Night of the Proms. There is mass rendering of patriotic songs, led by a band, while large Croatian flags are unfurled and waved.\n\nThese public displays of patriotism tell us a great deal about this region rich in traditions and conscious of a tragic past. Apart from Serbia, the countries of eastern Europe are fragments of the three great European empires, cast adrift upon their dissolution in 1918. Their distinct identities were diluted after the first world war by being incorporated into more or less artificial combinations like Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, and again after the second when most of them were subsumed into Russia's new east European empire and became monochrome communist states. They broke free in the 1990s, within the memory of most of those alive today. Everywhere you sense the pride of nationhood that only a new nation state can show. They thrive on heroic, semi-fictional images of a pre-imperial past, dominated by ancient national heroes like King Tomislav of Croatia, the pre-Ottoman Tsar Dusan of Serbia and Good King Matjaz of Carinthia (part of modern Slovenia).\n\nPeople grumble about the EU. For some of them, it has proved to be a mixed blessing. Croatia has seen some of its best native talent emigrate, taking advantage of the free-movement rules. Others, like Slovenia, have seized the opportunities of the developed world's largest single market with both hands. But the overriding factor is that the EU has made statehood economically viable for small nations, even if they have only a weak voice in Brussels. The Union is repairing the broken continent after a century of war and ideological division. For all the grumbling, few want to leave. Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Albania and Bosnia-Herzegovina and Ukraine are queuing up to join.\n\nFor an Englishman travelling at the opposite end of the continent in the aftermath of Brexit, the experience of these countries provokes sobering reflections. Britain is different. It is neither a small country nor a new one. It was also a large net contributor to the EU budget. But whatever one may think of the grubby internal politics and unworthy bossiness of the EU's institutions, we have not only done ourselves much economic damage by leaving it, but elected to stand aside from our continent's grandest and most inspiring project.",

        "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A large global survey issued on Friday showed a surge in despair and disillusionment with established politics, particularly among young American men, the only U.S. population group to turn more conservative over the past decade.\n\nThe study by the international research agency Glocalities, shared with Reuters, offered context for November's U.S. presidential poll and a plethora of votes worldwide, including a European Union parliamentary election in June.\n\nIt surveyed respondents to determine their position on a scale on a scale of optimism between 'hope' and 'despair', and on another between 'control' and 'freedom' - in other words, conservatism and liberalism.\n\nOn average, the world became more liberal between 2014 and 2023, even as it became more pessimistic, according to more than 300,000 surveys in 20 countries representing nearly 60% of the global population.\n\nYoung people the world over feel especially let down by society, said Martijn Lampert, head of research at Glocalities, adding that \"the surge in despair among young adults in the U.S. far outweighs the rise in despair among young adults in EU countries\".\n\nMost strikingly, young U.S. men were the only population group in the United States or seven EU member states actually to have become more conservative since 2014 - or, in the poll's terms, to favour more control rather than freedom.\n\nIn total, 14,526 Americans were polled between 2014 and 2023, including 2,242 men aged 18-34.\n\nWorldwide, \"feelings of hopelessness, societal disillusionment and rebelling against cosmopolitan values partly explain the rise of radical right anti-establishment parties\", Lampert said, citing elections in several European countries.\n\nSocial media algorithms were magnifying the trend by drawing \"moderately conservative young men towards more extreme and radical conservative male role models and world views\".\n\nYOUNG WOMEN 'THE MOST LIBERAL GROUP IN HISTORY'\n\nThe report also highlighted a sharp difference between the world's young men and young women.\n\nBoth were worried about career prospects, financial security and education but while men aged 18-24 overtook men aged 55-70 as the most socially conservative group, women of 18-24 grew more liberal and anti-patriarchal.\n\nOn a scale where 1 represents the most conservative and 5 the most liberal, women worldwide aged 18-24 moved from 3.55 in 2014 to 3.78 in 2023 - both easily the highest for any age group.\n\nMen of the same age moved from 3.29 to 3.36.

        "text": "U\n\nS President Joe Biden on Wednesday hosted Japanese Prime Minister Kishida Fumio for a state visit and held a crucial Oval Office meeting, reinforcing his commitment to bolstering the vital partnership in the Indo-Pacific amid a militarily and economically resurgent China, CNN reported.\n\nOver 70 items covering a wide array of critical sectors are expected to be announced as part of the bilateral meeting between Biden and Kishida, according to senior administration officials.\n\nThese include a commitment to changing the US force structure in Japan to improve how Japanese and US forces are integrated, establish a 'military-industrial council' to evaluate where the two countries can co-produce defence weapons to improve cooperation, and items related to integrating anti-missile defence between the US, Australia and Japan, according to officials.\n\nThe announcements are all part of a major update to the nation's military alliance but elements of them will take some time to implement, including the change to the US force structure, which will take several months for both countries to work through, a senior official noted, according to CNN.\n\nSpeaking on the White House, South Lawns, on Wednesday morning, Biden touched on the \"monumental alliance between our two great democracies.\"\n\n\"Together, we made it closer, stronger and more effective than ever before in history,\" Biden said at an official arrival ceremony.\n\nHe also recognised Japan's gift of 3,000 cherry trees more than 100 years ago as a symbol of that alliance, blooming each spring in Washington, DC. Japan has committed to planting 250 new trees along the Tidal Basin to honour the US's 250th birthday in 2026.\n\nBiden acknowledged the 'devastating' history between the US and Japan. He travelled to Hiroshima last year for a summit with G7 leaders and toured the Hiroshima Peace Museum, which chronicles the vast destruction of the US atomic bomb in the city in 1945, in the closing days of World War II.\n\nIt would have been easy for the two countries to remain adversaries given their bloody history, Biden noted.\n\n\"Instead,\" he said, \"we made a far better choice: We became the closest of friends.\"\n\n\"Today\", Biden added, \"Our democracies are beacons of freedom shining across the globe.\"\n\nThe leaders are also expected to detail space collaboration at a time when Japan has signalled an interest in landing its first astronaut on the Moon and lay out ways to increase people-to-people ties amid lagging student exchanges between the two countries in recent years. The astronaut would be the first non-American to set foot on the moon.\n\nSome of these partnerships include a joint artificial intelligence research initiative between Carnegie Mellon University and Keio University in Tokyo, as well as another AI-related exchange between the University of Washington and Washington State and Tsukuba University in Japan, according to the officials. This will also include creating a scholarship to fund high school students from the US to travel to Japan to study and vice versa.\n\nBut even as the US and Japan are bolstering their cooperation across a range of sectors, the two countries have seen a recent difference on the economic front with the president opposing Japan's efforts to purchase US Steel.\n\nResponding during a joint news conference to a question about the acquisition of the company-- at one point one of the most powerful companies in the world--by Japan-based Nippon Steel, Kishida described the USD 14.1 billion acquisition as an 'investment' in the United States.\n\n\"We hope these discussions will unfold in directions that would be positive for both sides,\" Kishida said. However, he did not directly address whether the two leaders discussed the acquisition during a private meeting held earlier in the day.\n\nBiden, who previously said it was 'vital' that the company remain American-owned and operated, said during the press conference--the first he's held in 2024--that he stands by \"my commitment to American workers\".\n\nThe meeting between Biden and Kishida will be followed later this week by the first-ever leaders' summit between the US, Japan and the Philippines with Biden working to draw Pacific allies and partners closer as the region grapples with China's aggression and nuclear provocations from North Korea.\n\nKishida said during the news conference that Japan will continue to call on China to \"fulfil its responsibilities as a major power\", while also striving to establish a 'constructive and stable' relationship with the superpower.\n\n\"We confirmed that unilateral attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion is absolutely unacceptable wherever it may be,\" he added.\n\nAll of the deliverables on the agenda are part of a concerted military, diplomatic and strategic effort to try and 'flip the script' and counter Chinese efforts to isolate American allies such as the Philippines and Japan, according to the senior administration official.\n\n\"The idea of switching to a multilateral, lattice-like strategic architecture is to flip the script and isolate China,\" the official added.\n\nFurther, according to CNN, Japan has been at the centre of Biden's alliance building in the Indo-Pacific, as officials have seen a willing partner in Kishida, who has significantly shifted the country's defence posture in recent years and provided ongoing support to Ukraine amid Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nKishida has committed to increasing defence spending by 2 per cent of GDP by 2037 and acquired American Tomahawk missiles to increase its counterstrike capabilities.\n\nBefore entering the White House, the president and national security adviser Jake Sullivan tasked the transition team to tap into alliances and partnerships where they saw \"extraordinary potential if only the United States turned back to it and reembraced it\", another senior administration official said.\n\n\"What we did was put together a strategy that was designed to help a wide range of allies and partners see pieces of themselves and their own objectives in our Indo-Pacific strategy,\" the official said.\n\nJoe Biden hosts Japan's PM at White House, in strong message to China over policies in Indo-Pacific",

        "text": "Throughout the trial, Simpson's legal team became a regular presence on television and on newsstands.\n\nNew Delhi:\n\nFormer American football player and actor O.J. Simpson lived a life filled with glory on the field but overshadowed by infamy off it, his family has announced. He died Thursday of prostate cancer, his family announced. While his accomplishments in sports and entertainment were notable, it was the courtroom drama that took place in the mid-1990s that left its mark on American culture and justice.\n\nSimpson was involved in what became known as the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, outside their Los Angeles home in June 1994. The \"Trial of the Century\" event. The ensuing investigation led to the incident being uncovered. Simpson became the center of attention as the prime suspect.\n\nThe events that followed, including Simpson's attempt to evade law enforcement during a televised car chase and subsequent arrest, drew unprecedented national attention. The ensuing murder trial began in January 1995, with the prosecution's case pitted against Simpson's defense and racial tensions simmering beneath the surface.\n\ntry out\n\nThroughout the trial, Simpson's legal team became a regular presence on television and on newsstands. The famous \"Dream Team\" consisting of F Lee Bailey, Robert Blasier, Johnnie Cochran, Alan Dershowitz, Shawn Chapman Holley, Robert Kardashian and Robert Shapiro changed the public's perception of the criminal justice system and unexpectedly influenced reality television.\n\nThe media scrutinizes every detail, turning court proceedings into a spectacle watched by millions. Prosecutors argued Simpson was guilty and presented evidence linking him to the crime scene, while the defense countered by citing police misconduct and racial bias.\n\nSee also Putin says Russia is on the verge of developing breakthrough cancer vaccine\n\nThe trial climaxed in a crucial moment when Simpson struggled to put on the gloves believed to be worn by his killer. The iconic scene in which Simpson's hands failed to fill the gloves became a rallying cry for his defense team. These gloves remain a symbol of enduring drama in the courtroom.\n\nbloody gloves\n\nThe saga of the blood-stained glove begins with discoveries in separate locations: one outside Brown's residence and another on Simpson's own estate.\n\nHowever, when the moment of truth arrived and Simpson tried to put on the gloves, the scene unfolded dramatically. The gloves don't fit properly. This unique moment gave birth to Johnny Cochran's iconic line: \"If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.\"\n\nA dramatic scene unfolded in court as Simpson apparently struggled to fit the gloves onto the thinner latex gloves he had been given. The performance led jurors to question whether the gloves really belonged to him. The incident, which took place on June 15, 1995, became one of the defining moments of the trial, with observers later noting that Simpson, who had appeared in movies, brought his acting skills to bear in the courtroom.\n\nImage source: AFP\n\nThe prosecution countered. They said the gloves shrank from exposure to blood. However, doubts remain.\n\nIn October 1995, the jury returned the verdict: not guilty. Simpson's acquittal has divided America along racial lines and sparked debate about the fairness of the justice system and the role of celebrities in legal proceedings.\n\nSimpson's legal troubles did not end with his acquittal, however. In 2007, he faced armed robbery and kidnapping charges following a confrontation in a Las Vegas hotel room. Simpson was convicted and imprisoned, serving nine years before being released in 2017.\n\nSee also Biden reiterates need for release of US journalists jailed in Russia",

        "text": "The post-Cold War world has never faced such severe challenges as it does today. It is significant that the leaders of Japan and the United States have united and agreed to work together in a wide range of areas, including security, energy and space.\n\nNow is an era for the two countries to further strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance and utilize it to build a new international order.\n\nPrime Minister Fumio Kishida paid an official visit to the United States as a state guest and met with U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington.\n\nDuring their meeting, the two leaders agreed that the Japan-U.S. alliance \"has reached unprecedented heights.\" After the meeting, they issued a joint statement that positions the two countries as \"global partners\" in addressing global challenges not only in the Indo-Pacific region but also around the world.\n\nThe most significant feature of this meeting was the decision on a policy of reviewing the respective \"command and control\" frameworks to enable the Self-Defense Forces and the U.S. military to operate in a more integrated manner.\n\nThe U.S. forces in Japan are currently operating under the direction of the Indo-Pacific Command, which has its headquarters in Hawaii.\n\nMeanwhile, Japan plans to establish a Joint Operations Command at the end of this fiscal year to manage the operations of the SDF's ground, maritime and air branches in an integrated manner. In conjunction with this, the U.S. military reportedly will transfer part of the authority of the Indo-Pacific Command to the U.S. forces command in Japan to proceed smoothly with joint operations with the SDF.\n\nA contingency in the Taiwan Strait is an increasingly realistic possibility. North Korea has repeatedly launched missiles and continued its provocative actions. A system must be put in place so that Japan and the United States can respond immediately in an emergency.\n\nIn the meeting, they also agreed to expand joint development and production of equipment, such as missiles. The United States, which has continued to provide military assistance to Ukraine, is facing tight production capacity for equipment. Therefore, the agreement in this regard means that Japan will supplement its production system.\n\nThe Kishida administration has decided that Japan will possess counterattack capabilities to strike enemy missile launch sites, and is working to review the conventional roles of the United States as the spear and Japan as the shield.\n\nThese efforts will undoubtedly enable the integrated operations of the U.S. military and the SDF and lead to the enhancement of their deterrence capabilities. The agreement reached at this summit may be the starting point for new defense cooperation between the two countries.\n\nHowever, there are issues regarding integrated operations of the SDF and the U.S. military.\n\nIn a situation that threatens Japan's survival, the SDF can exercise Japan's right to collective self-defense and cooperate with the U.S. military in fighting. However, if Japan supports the U.S. military in fighting without the recognition of a survival-threatening situation, discussions will be needed on whether being an integral part of combat actions is consistent with the Constitution.\n\nIt is vital to sort out problems in line with reality.\n\nThe results of the summit are not limited to the defense sector. The two leaders agreed to promote technical cooperation toward generating electricity with nuclear fusion, which is expected to become a next-generation energy source. If put to practical use, it would be able to provide a stable energy source and contribute to the international community.\n\nIn the space sector, they decided to send two Japanese astronauts to land on the moon as part of the U.S.-led Artemis program of manned lunar exploration.\n\nOn economic security, they confirmed that the Group of Seven advanced nations would cooperate to ensure a stable supply of semiconductors and important minerals, including rare metals.\n\nChina has repeatedly used economic coercion to put pressure on countries it has political conflicts with by restricting trade with them in important minerals and other goods. Multilateral cooperation is needed to reduce dependence on China.\n\nThe international situation is chaotic, and Japan's diplomatic abilities are being tested.\n\nThe United States is forced to respond to Russia's aggression against Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, and it has only a limited capacity to deal with security issues in Asia.\n\nChina increases its hegemonic behavior in the East China Sea and the South China Sea and North Korea also continues its nuclear and missiles development. Japan should play a leading role in protecting peace in Asia.\n\nJapan has long supported the development of the so-called Global South emerging and developing countries and has built good relations with these countries. In the Middle East, Japan has never engaged in a conflict and does not get involved in religious hostilities.\n\nIt is hoped that Japan will use its strengths and play a role as a bridge between the West and emerging countries. It is important to call on Israel and the Islamist group Hamas for a ceasefire.\n\nIn the meeting with Biden, Kishida sought understanding of dialogues and negotiations between Japan and North Korea to resolve the issue of the abduction of Japanese nationals to North Korea, and he obtained Biden's support.\n\nEven if a Japan-North Korea summit is to be held, it can only be on the understanding that Japan-U.S.-South Korea cooperation is maintained. Kishida must not forget that principle.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said.

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "Ukrainian lawmakers approved on April 11 an army mobilization bill to bolster troop numbers against Russia, a day after a clause allowing long-serving soldiers to return home from the front was scrapped.\n\nThe law is designed to facilitate army recruitment but has caused some anger in a nation exhausted by more than two years of battling Moscow's forces.\n\n\"The bill on mobilization was adopted as a whole,\" MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak said in a post on Telegram.\n\nHe said 283 of the parliament's 450 deputies had voted in favor of the legislation, which toughens punishments for draft dodgers.\n\nThe Ukrainian military has been weakened by a failed 2023 counter-offensive against Russia and by the blocking in the U.S. Congress of key military aid.\n\nIt is also believed to have suffered huge losses.\n\nEarlier this month, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky lowered the mobilization age from 27 to 25 because Kiev is short of soldiers to fight Russian forces.\n\nAnd on April 10 parliament announced a popular clause on demobilizing soldiers who had been fighting for 36 months was being scrapped at the demand of the army.\n\nZelensky is still required to sign the mobilization law for it to take effect.\n\nHe took almost a year to sign a previous bill lowering the mobilization age after it was passed by parliament.\n\nMeanwhile, Zelensky said yesterday that Russia fired more than 40 missiles and 40 drones at Ukraine overnight, again hitting the city of Kharkiv and targeting \"critical infrastructure\" throughout the country.\n\nKiev reported a \"massive\" attack on the country's major facilities, but said that so far nobody has been reported killed.\n\n\"Overnight, Russia fired more than 40 missiles and 40 drones at Ukraine,\" Zelensky said on X.\n\n\"Some missiles and 'Shahed' drones were successfully shot down. Unfortunately, only a part of them,\" he added.\n\n\"There was another vile missile attack on Kharkiv and the Kharkiv region,\" he said. The northeastern city has been pounded by Russian attacks, some deadly, in recent weeks.\n\nZelensky said infrastructure facilities were also targeted in Kiev, the cities of Zaporizhzhia and Odesa in the south, and the western city of Lviv, near the Polish border.\n\n\"Russian terrorists once again targeted critical infrastructure,\" he said.\n\nMoscow has heavily attacked Ukraine's energy facilities over recent months, launching some of its biggest aerial strikes of the two-year war.\n\nZelensky called on Ukraine's Western partners not to \"turn a blind eye\" and to provide more air defense systems.",

A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.",

He faces criminal charges in Russia for refusing to go to war in Ukraine. \"I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "The OJ Simpson saga was a unique American moment. 3 decades on, we're still wondering what it means\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- O.J. Simpson's death came almost exactly three decades after the murders that changed his reputation from football hero to suspect and cultural touchstone. It summoned remembrances of an odd moment in time in which the country watched a Ford Bronco inch its way along a California freeway with no idea what would happen next. Looking at the case and how it was watched from the vantage point of 2024 offers glimpses into how American society and media have changed in the course of a generation. It also reveals what in today's culture might be descended from those weird days in 1994 and 1995.\n\nLegendary athlete, actor and millionaire: O.J. Simpson's murder trial lost him the American dream\n\nLAS VEGAS (AP) -- For a long time, O.J. Simpson had it all. He lived the American dream as a sports legend, movie actor, commercial pitchman and millionaire. With his wildly successful career, good looks and a gorgeous wife, he became an image of success for Black Americans and was embraced by people of all races. His sensational trial for the murder of his white ex-wife and her friend transfixed the nation and divided the country along racial lines. A criminal court jury found him not guilty of murder in 1995, but a separate civil trial jury found him liable in 1997 for the deaths and ordered him to pay $33.5 million to the family members of the victims. Simpson died Wednesday of prostate cancer. He was 76.\n\nRussian soldiers who quit Putin's war get no hero's welcome abroad as asylum claims surge\n\nASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- Growing numbers of Russian soldiers are trying to get out of the war in Ukraine. Overall asylum claims from Russians have surged in the U.S., France and Germany since Russia's full-scale invasion two years ago, but few are getting in. Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes? The Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted, some through underground networks of Russian activists who guided them on secret escape routes. Facing criminal charges in Russia, all but one live in hiding as they wait for a welcome from the West that hasn't arrived. They argue that helping deserters is in the West's own interest and less costly than shipping weapons to Ukraine.\n\nMore aid is supposed to be entering the Gaza Strip. Why isn't it helping?\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- Under heavy U.S. pressure, Israel has promised to ramp up aid to Gaza dramatically, saying last week it would open another cargo crossing and surge more trucks than ever before into the besieged enclave. But days later there are few signs of those promised materializing and international officials say famine is fast approaching. While Israel says it has dramatically increased the number of aids trucks entering the territory, U.N. workers report only a slight uptick -- possibly because they count trucks differently. Here's what we know about the aid entering Gaza and why discrepancies in reporting persist.\n\nMuslim leaders are 'out of words' as they tire of the White House outreach on the war in Gaza\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Some Muslim and Arab American leaders have grown frustrated with the outreach from President Joe Biden's White House as the war in Gaza drags on. They say private meetings with officials at all levels of the administration have failed to lead to meaningful changes in U.S. support for Israel, and they're unwilling to continue talking. The fractured relationship could jeopardize the Democratic president's reelection campaign and help pave the way for Republican Donald Trump to return to the White House. Biden's team believes it still can have some productive conversations to keep open important lines of communication.\n\nMany say Biden and Trump did more harm than good, but for different reasons, AP-NORC poll shows\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- A new poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds that more than half of U.S. adults think Joe Biden's presidency has hurt the country on cost of living and immigration. Meanwhile, nearly half think Donald Trump's presidency hurt the country on voting rights and election security, relations with foreign countries, abortion laws and climate change. The poll numbers also show Americans generally think that in the White House, both did more harm than good. Meanwhile, when asked which president did more to help people like them, roughly one-third say Donald Trump and about one-quarter say Joe Biden. Yet roughly 30% of adults said neither Biden nor Trump benefitted them.\n\nManhattan court must find a dozen jurors to hear first-ever criminal case against a former president\n\nNEW YORK (AP) -- A dozen Manhattan residents are soon to become the first Americans ever to sit in judgment of a former president charged with a crime. Jury selection is set to start Monday in former President Donald Trump's hush-money trial. The presumptive Republican nominee has pleaded not guilty. The proceedings present a historic challenge for the court, the lawyers and the everyday citizens who find themselves in the jury pool. Those problems include finding people who can be impartial about one of the most polarizing figures in American life and detecting any bias among prospective jurors without invading the privacy of the ballot box.\n\n'I'm dying, you're not': Those terminally ill ask more states to legalize physician-assisted death\n\nDENVER (AP) -- Lawmakers in at least 12 states are debating bills that would legalize physician-assisted death. The laws would allow terminally ill patients under specified conditions to end their lives with a doctor's help. Physician-assisted death is contentious and only 10 states and Washington, D.C., allow it. Patients must be at least 18 years old, within six months of death and be assessed by doctors to ensure they are capable of making an informed decision. Two states have gone in the opposite direction. Kansas has a bill to further criminalize those who help someone with their physician-assisted death. West Virginia is asking voters to enshrine its current ban into the state constitution.\n\n20 years later, Abu Ghraib detainees get their day in US court\n\nALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Twenty years ago this month, photos of abused prisoners and smiling U.S. soldiers guarding them at Iraq's Abu Ghraib prison were released, shocking the world. Now, three survivors of Abu Ghraib will finally get their day in U.S. court against the military contractor they hold responsible for their mistreatment. A trial scheduled to begin Monday in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, will be the first time that Abu Ghraib survivors have been able to bring their claims of torture to a U.S. jury. The defendant in the civil suit, CACI, supplied the interrogators who worked at the prison. The Virginia-based contractor denies any wrongdoing.\n\nIf O.J. Simpson's assets go to court, Goldman, Brown families could be first in line\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson died without having paid the lion's share of the $33.5 million judgment a civil jury awarded to the families of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. The panel found Simpson liable in a wrongful death lawsuit in 1997. Now, his money is likely to go into the court probate process. And the Goldman and Brown families could be at the front of the line to get paid a piece of whatever Simpson left behind. If he had any meaningful assets at all, his four children will have to let a court look at them before they can receive it.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals?

The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia.

None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

He highlighted that the combined explosive power of aviation strikes on Ukraine during this period exceeds 9 kilotons. Only 3% of Russian missiles, drones and guided bombs hit military targets, while 97% hit civilian infrastructure.\n\nHe emphasized that Russia deliberately targeted critical energy infrastructure, including power generation facilities. Following attacks in March, 80% of thermal energy production was destroyed, and hydroelectric power stations also suffered significant damage.\n\nKyslytsya reminded the UN of ongoing shelling in Kharkiv.\n\n\"Kharkiv - the second largest city in Ukraine before the war - has become a particular target for the Russian forces. Russian state-affiliated expert Aleksandr Sytin, who is the Head of the so-called \"Center for Political Studies of Northern and Eastern European Countries\" openly admitted on a Russian federal TV channel that \"the capture or destruction of Kharkiv will have a painful, demoralizing effect on Ukrainian society. But I believe that the will of this people needs to be broken over the knee. That's why Russia shells Kharkiv's civilian infrastructure on an almost daily basis with rockets, drones and aerial guided bombs. Almost all critical energy infrastructure in the region, including the Zmiiv Thermal Power Plant, was destroyed,\" he said.\n\nKyslytsya noted that even though the regimes of dictators Putin and Hitler \"are not identical twins, they have the same toxic DNA.\"",

A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "A Russian officer who goes by the nickname Sportsmaster speaks with reporters at his apartment in Astana, Kazakhstan, in late 2023. He faces criminal charges in Russia for refusing to go to war in Ukraine. \"I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him.

The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself.

Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "According to a new market research report published by Report Ocean, the global Paper Straw Market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of $%, during the forecast period. The market is estimated to reach $$ billion by 2031.\n\nThis detailed market research report by Report Ocean include in-depth analysis of technological innovations, market trends, supply chain trends, future trends, leading players, and key developments. The report also includes additional information about other factors such as drivers, restraints and challenges faced by this market, along with an overview for each mentioned segment in the study.\n\nRequest To Download Sample of This Strategic Report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bwcc17927\n\nThe global paper straw market revenue was around US$ 865.3 million in 2021 and is estimated to reach US$ 3016.2 million by 2031, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.3% during the forecast period from 2022 to 2031.\n\nPaper straw is a small, flexible tube used to suck liquid into the mouth that is made of waterproof paper. Several thin paper reels are passed through a glue bath during the production of paper straws. Then, a lengthy paper cylinder is formed by winding together these tacky reels. After being trimmed to size, the lengthy cylinder tubes are subsequently packaged and transported.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau reports that the goods and services deficit rose from $68.7 billion in January 2023 to $70.5 billion in February, an increase of $1.9 billion. Due to a $2.7 billion increase in the goods deficit to $93.0 billion and a $0.8 billion increase in the services surplus to $22.4 billion, the goods and services deficit increased in February. The goods and services deficit has decreased this year by $35.5 billion, or 20.3% when compared to the same period in 2022. $10.8% more, or $49.5 billion, was exported. Imports cost $2.2% more, or $14.0 billion, than exports.\n\nFactors Influencing Market Growth\n\nThe market growth of alternative straws, such as paper straws, is influenced by several key factors. One of the primary drivers is government initiatives to reduce plastic usage and the implementation of severe regulatory restrictions on conventional plastic utensils. These measures aim to curb plastic pollution and promote more sustainable alternatives. As a result, the demand for alternative straws, including paper straws, is expected to increase, driving market growth.\n\nMany producers in sectors such as packaging, textiles, and agriculture are transitioning to bio-based products for straw production. Bio-based materials offer a more environmentally friendly solution compared to traditional plastics. This shift towards bio-based straws further propels the market expansion as businesses and consumers increasingly prioritize sustainability.\n\nHowever, strict government rules and the installation of equipment required for manufacturing paper straws may hinder market growth. Compliance with regulatory requirements and the necessary investments in machinery and infrastructure can pose challenges for manufacturers, potentially limiting the growth rate of the market.\n\nGet a Free Sample PDF copy of the report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bwcc17927\n\nRegional Insights\n\nEurope dominates the market in terms of the highest market shares and is predicted to continue expanding during the projection period. The region has implemented strict limits on single-use plastic products, which has increased the use of alternative straws in the food service sector.

        "title": "EXPLAINER-Sudan's conflict: Who is backing the rival commanders?",
        "text": "ANALYSIS-Climate verdict for Swiss women a warning for European states, oil industry\n\nAs a devastating conflict has unfolded across Sudan over the past year, the country's military rivals have sought support from foreign backers as they try to tip the contest in their favour.\n\nThat backing risks widening and prolonging the war between the Sudanese armed forces, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, commonly known as Hemedti.\n\nThe influence of outside players has loomed over events in Sudan since the overthrow of former leader Omar al-Bashir during a popular uprising five years ago.\n\nWHO SUPPORTS BURHAN?\n\nBurhan's clearest ally has been Egypt, which shares a border with Sudan that more than 500,000 people have crossed since the fighting began.\n\nIn both countries, the military has assumed a dominant role in the decades since independence and has intervened following popular uprisings - in Egypt when former army chief Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi led the ousting of democratically elected President Mohamed Mursi a decade ago, and in Sudan when Burhan led a military takeover in 2021.\n\nSince the war started, Egypt has received Burhan and his representatives on visits and has launched a peace process involving Sudan's neighbours that ran in parallel with mediation efforts led by the United States, Saudi Arabia and African regional grouping IGAD.\n\nIt has joined calls for an effective ceasefire while saying it considers the conflict an internal matter for Sudan.\n\nAnother country that neighbours areas of Sudan controlled by the army and where Burhan has sought to shore up regional support is Eritrea, one of his first stops when he resumed foreign trips last year.\n\nSince late 2023, sources say the army has also drawn on material support from Iran, including Iranian-made drones that helped it make significant gains in Omdurman, part of Sudan's wider capital.\n\nSudan's acting foreign minister, who is aligned with the army and visited Tehran this year as diplomatic ties that had been cut in 2016 were restored, denied weapons had been received.\n\nFrom further afield, Ukrainian special forces have intervened on the army's side to counter alleged support for the RSF from Russian mercenary group Wagner, according to several reports in Ukrainian and international media.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy held an impromptu meeting with Burhan in Ireland in September to discuss \"illegal armed groups financed by Russia\".\n\nWHO SUPPORTS HEMEDTI?\n\nFor several years, Hemedti's most important ally has been the United Arab Emirates, Sudanese sources, analysts and diplomats say.\n\nThe UAE has aggressively sought to roll back Islamist influence across the region, intervening in conflicts in countries including Libya and Yemen. Hemedti has presented himself as a bulwark against Islamist-leaning factions that established deep roots in the army and other institutions under Bashir.\n\nU.N. experts say reports that the UAE has sent arms to the RSF through eastern Chad are \"credible\", and that sources in Chad and Darfur reported cargo planes had delivered the weapons and ammunition several times a week.\n\nThe UAE has denied making any such shipments and has said its role in Sudan is focused on humanitarian support and calls for de-escalation.\n\nThe UAE has also provided Hemedti, who grew rich through the gold trade, with a platform for channelling his finances as well as public relations support for the RSF, according to Andreas Krieg, Associate Professor at King's College, London.\n\nIn a report published in January, the U.N. experts said the RSF, which has fostered tribal alliances stretching across Sudan's western borders, brought weapons into Sudan from Libya and the Central African Republic, and fuel from South Sudan.\n\nBefore the war broke out, Hemedti had cultivated ties with Russia. Western diplomats in Khartoum said in 2022 that Russia's Wagner Group was involved in illicit gold mining in Sudan and was spreading disinformation. Hemedti said he advised Sudan to cut ties with Wagner after the U.S. imposed sanctions on the military contractor. Wagner said last year that it was no longer operating in Sudan.\n\nWHICH OTHER POWERS HAVE INFLUENCE?\n\nSaudi Arabia had close ties to Burhan and Hemedti dating to before the war. Both men were involved in sendingSudanese troops to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.\n\nAs it steps up its diplomatic ambitions across the Middle East, Riyadh has asserted itself in mediating over Sudan while also looking to protect its economic ambitions in the Red Sea region, said Anna Jacobs, Senior Gulf Analyst with Crisis Group.\n\n\"Saudi Arabia is focused on Red Sea security, which is integral to Saudi Vision 2030 and investments along the Red Sea like Neom,\" she said, referring to the futuristic city backed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the United States led unsuccessful efforts last year to negotiate a ceasefire in Sudan.\n\nEast African powers Ethiopia and Kenya also hold some sway due to their prominent role in regional diplomacy and previous mediation in Sudan.\n\nSouth Sudan hosted peace talks between the Sudanese state and rebel groups in recent years, and was designated as one of the countries that could host talks over the current crisis.\n\nIsrael, which had been hoping to move forward in normalising ties with Sudan, has also offered to host talks.\n\nWHAT IS THE WEST'S POSITION?\n\nBefore the war, Western powers had belatedly swung behind a transition towards elections as the military shared power with civilians after Bashir's overthrow, offering direct financial support that was frozen when Burhan and Hemedti staged a coup in 2021.\n\nAfter the coup and led by the United States, Western powers supported a new transition deal that ended up triggering the eruption of fighting by creating a stand-off over the future structure of the military.\n\nCritics say the U.S. was too lenient with the generals.\n\n\"Their strategy was stability and their basic misconception was that they would get stability by backing the apparently strong and decisive and cohesive players who happened to be in power,\" said Alex de Waal, a Sudan expert and head of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University.",

        "title": "EXPLAINER-Why is Sudan still at war a year on?",
        "text": "ANALYSIS-Climate verdict for Swiss women a warning for European states, oil industry\n\nA conflict in Sudan that erupted a year ago has wreaked havoc across swathes of the country, unleashed waves of ethnic violence in Darfur, driven millions into extreme hunger and created the world's largest displacement crisis.\n\nWHAT TRIGGERED THE VIOLENCE?\n\nTensions had been building for months before fighting between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) erupted in the capital Khartoum on April 15, 2023.\n\nThe army and RSF had been in a fragile partnership after toppling a civilian government in an October 2021 coup, a move that derailed a transition from the rule of Islamist autocrat Omar al-Bashir, who was ousted amid a popular uprising in 2019.\n\nThe rivalry between the two sides burst into the open over an internationally backed plan that would have launched a new transition with civilian parties and was due to be sealed just before the war broke out.\n\nBoth the army and the RSF were required to cede power under the plan and two issues proved especially contentious. One was the timetable for the RSF to be integrated into the regular armed forces. A second was the chain of command between the army and RSF leaders and the question of civilian oversight.\n\nThe warring parties have also been in competition over sprawling business interests that reach beyond Sudan's borders.\n\nWHO ARE THE MAIN PLAYERS ON THE GROUND?\n\nThe protagonists in the power struggle are General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, head of the army and leader of Sudan's ruling council since 2019, and his former deputy on the council, RSF leader General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, commonly known as Hemedti.\n\nThe whereabouts of the two men was often unclear in the early stages of the conflict as fighting subsumed Khartoum. Later, Burhan began to make public appearances in Sudan, as the army and allied government ministries established a presence in the Red Sea city of Port Sudan.\n\nBoth Burhan and Hemedti travelled outside the country to rally support.\n\nHemedti, who grew wealthy through gold mining and other ventures, is the undisputed leader of the RSF. Members of his family and clan play leading roles and the force's support base is the western region of Darfur, where the RSF emerged from militias that fought alongside government forces to crush rebels in a brutal war that escalated after 2003.\n\nHemedti has also courted some civilian politicians who were involved in plans for a democratic transition before the war.\n\nAnalysts say Burhan's position is less assured at the head of the army, where Islamist-leaning Bashir loyalists and veterans have gained sway since the 2021 coup.\n\nThe RSF routinely says it is fighting to rid Sudan of remnants of Bashir's regime, while the army says it is trying to protect the state against \"criminal\" rebels.\n\nWitnesses say the RSF and its allies have committed extensive abuses including ethnically targeted killings, sexual violence and looting. Residents have accused the army of killing civilians in indiscriminate shelling and air strikes. Both sides have largely denied the accusations against them.\n\nWHO'S WINNING?\n\nThough Sudan's army has superior resources, including air power and an estimated 300,000 troops, the RSF had grown in recent years into a well-equipped force of some 100,000 deployed around the country.\n\nIn the first days of the war, the RSF's more nimble units embedded in neighbourhoods across the capital. Towards the end of 2023, the RSF made a series of rapid advances to consolidate its grip on Darfur and take over El Gezira state south of Khartoum, a key agricultural area.\n\nMore recently however, the army has regained some footing, making its most significant advances to date in Omdurman, one of the three cities that make up the wider capital.\n\nWHAT'S AT STAKE?\n\nThe uprising that led to Bashir's overthrow had raised hopes that Sudan and its population of 49 million could emerge from decades of autocracy, internal conflict and economic isolation.\n\nBut a year of warfare has inflicted massive damage on infrastructure, forced more than 8.5 million people from their homes and driven almost 5 million people to near-famine conditions.\n\nHomes, offices, warehouses and banks have been widely looted, hospitals put out of service and trade and farming disrupted. Thousands of civilians have been killed - death toll estimates are highly uncertain - and both sides have been accused of committing war crimes.\n\nAid agencies say fighting, looting and bureaucratic hurdles have severely hampered the delivery of relief.\n\nIntensified political and ethnic rivalries within Sudan have led to fears that the country, Africa's third largest by area, could splinter, destabilising a volatile region bordering the Sahel, the Red Sea and the Horn of Africa.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people have fled to Egypt, Chad and South Sudan, with smaller numbers crossing into Ethiopia and the Central African Republic.\n\nBoth sides have been using gold, Sudan's most valuable and widely smuggled resource, to support their war effort.\n\nWHAT'S THE ROLE OF FOREIGN STATES?\n\nThe conflict has played into competition for influence in Sudan and the surrounding region among regional and global powers including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and Russia.\n\nGulf states have previously pursued investments in sectors including agriculture, where Sudan holds vast potential, and ports. Russia has been seeking to build a naval base on Sudan's Red Sea coast.\n\nThe UAE has provided arms to the RSF, according to reporting by U.N. experts, while sources say Iran has flown in military support for the army.\n\nEgypt, itself ruled by military man President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi who overthrew his Islamist predecessor, has deep ties to Burhan and the army.\n\nWestern powers, including the United States, had swung behind the transition towards democratic elections following Bashir's overthrow. Diplomatic attention on Sudan has been limited by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.\n\nWHAT EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO END THE WAR?\n\nLast year Saudi Arabia and the United States brought delegations from both factions to Jeddah for talks, but the ceasefires agreed there were repeatedly violated and the process faltered.\n\nOther initiatives have been launched by African regional grouping IGAD and by Egypt, leading to concern about overlapping diplomatic efforts and rivalry.\n\nFighting has continued in past weeks despite appeals for a ceasefire from the U.N. Security Council and Secretary General during the holy Muslim month of Ramadan\n\nThe recently appointed U.S. special envoy for Sudan is pushing for a restart of talks this month in Jeddah.\n\nParis is hosting a donors' conference on April 15 to try to mobilise aid funding and secure more access for humanitarian workers.",

No further details about the facility or the damage were immediately available.\n\n[ 'Soldiers on the energy front' - Ukraine's workers in high-risk race to repair bombed power grid ]\n\nSince late March, Russia has launched multiple major attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, dealing significant damage to the Ukrainian power system and causing emergency power cuts in some regions.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's defence ministry said on Friday that its air defence forces had thwarted what it described as a series of attempted overnight \"terrorist attacks\" by Ukrainian drones on targets inside Russia.\n\nIt said in a statement that four Ukrainian drones had been destroyed over Russia's Rostov region and one over Russia's Belgorod region, which borders Ukraine.\n\nOn Thursday, Ukraine's parliament passed a controversial bill that will change the rules on civilian military mobilisation in an effort to address fledgling manpower among its forces.\n\nThe legislation, which must be signed by the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is seen as crucial for Ukraine to address what military analysts say are major manpower problems as it fights a better armed and larger foe.\n\nRussian forces outnumber Ukrainian troops seven to ten times in eastern regions, Ukraine's Gen Yuriy Sodol told parliament on Thursday. \"The enemy outnumbers us by 7-10 times, we lack manpower,\" said Sodol, who is commanding the troops in Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine.\n\nRussian missiles and drones destroyed a large electricity plant near Kyiv and hit power facilities in several regions of Ukraine on Thursday, officials said.\n\nThe major attack destroyed the Trypilska coal-powered thermal power plant near the capital, a senior official at the company that runs the facility told Reuters.\n\nThe mass use of \"drop-and-forget\" guided bombs containing foreign components is driving Russian advances in Ukraine, with up to 500 now being fired a week, according to a Ukrainian government analysis. High explosive and cluster bombs fitted with \"UMPC\" guiding systems with a range of 40-60km (25-37 miles) are now said to be a central threat on the frontline, forcing back Ukrainian forces. - Reuters",

The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military.

Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "title": "Industrial production of weapons is key - Commander of NATO's Allied Forces Europe",
        "text": "General Christopher Cavoli, Supreme Commander of NATO's Allied Forces Europe, believes that providing necessary assistance, primarily artillery ammunition, is crucial to Ukraine's victory in the war, which increasingly resembles a competition between the military industries of two countries.\n\nSource: Cavoli at a hearing of the US House of Representatives Armed Services Committee; Voice of America\n\nDetails: Cavoli said the seriousness of the situation in the war in Ukraine is difficult to overstate, as Ukraine is \"almost entirely dependent\" on external assistance to continue the fight. If the US does not continue to support Ukraine, it can lose.\n\nCavoli considers Russia to be a \"chronic threat\" to the US.\n\nAt the hearings, which covered a wide range of topics, Cavoli expressed \"absolute\" confidence that Ukraine can win the war given the appropriate level of ammunition supply, as Ukrainians have got the \"skill and determination\". The general noted that given the production level, the side with greater determination will win \"and that will be Ukraine\".\n\nAs of now, Ukraine continues to rely almost entirely on the US for the production and 155-mm ammunition supply, in addition to some other key military technologies. European production, Cavoli said, does not yet meet the demand level, despite its gradual growth and investments to its acceleration.\n\nSome European countries, such as Slovakia, were able to quickly reprofile their old factories to produce these shells. However, it will take several months for the production of 155mm shells in the EU to reach the US level.\n\nMeanwhile, other European countries have provided Ukraine with all or nearly all of their available weapons, \"Eastern European countries have emptied their pockets for Ukraine. Some of them have given 100% of what they have in a given category\".\n\nCavoli emphasised that fulfilling requests for assistance to Ukraine through the Ukraine Defence Contact Group, which involves over 50 countries, is \"complex\", as much of the support depends on the military production levels in Ukraine's partner countries, given the depletion of previously available stocks.\n\nIncreasing such production is one of the key issues being addressed by allies against the backdrop of Russia forming \"strategic partnerships\" with China, Iran and North Korea as well as during the blocking of additional funding for Ukraine in the US Congress.\n\nTherefore, in a war that, as US Senator Angus King pointed out, has become a \"battle between industrial capacity\", Ukraine could \"absolutely\" win if it were provided with the necessary amount of armaments.\n\nQuote from Cavoli: \"They have the skill, but most importantly, they have the determination to accomplish their goals. They need external support until they are able to generate their own industrial production. I agree with you that, in a long war like this, it is, in large part, a matter of industrial production of output. Once that output is achieved, the side with the greater determination will win, and that will be Ukraine.\"\n\nMore details: \"We are their main supplier in critical areas, especially in ammunition. Without our help, they will not be able to continue the fight\".\n\nIn addition to artillery shells, Cavoli also mentioned anti-air defence system launchers and especially air defence missiles as \"absolutely critical\" at this stage. The United States is currently the main supplier of these military technologies. US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is now \"very actively seeking\" additional missiles for Patriot batteries for Ukraine: \"It's vital.\"\n\nAs for the assistance to Ukraine that may be needed after Congress potentially passes additional funding, it will also depend on the level of production in Ukraine and in partner countries.\n\nCavoli said that it has become really clear that the level of industrial production is now the key: \"Not only in terms of capital things... like tanks and so on, but also, more importantly, consumables like ammunition, missiles, etc.\"\n\nThe question of confronting Russia in the future will also depend to a large extent on technology and production, particularly given Russia's use of US components in its weapons.\n\nHe also noted that if the current war is a competition of production, Ukraine's ability to deal with the Russian threat in the future will depend on whether it can build forces faster than they can: \"Part of that [means] preventing them from building forces quickly. And the fact that they are using components that should be sanctioned and banned is unfortunate, and we have to fix it.\"",

        "text": "The Russian city of Orenburg battled rising water levels on Thursday after major rivers across Russia and Kazakhstan burst their banks in the worst flooding seen in the areas in nearly a century.\n\nThe deluge of meltwater has forced over 110,000 people from their homes in Russia's Ural Mountains, Siberia and Kazakhstan as major rivers such as the Ural, which flows through Kazakhstan into the Caspian, overwhelmed embankments, Reuters reported.\n\nResidents in the city of Orenburg said the waters of the Ural rose very swiftly and to far beyond breaking point, forcing them to flee with just their children, pets and a few belongings.\n\n\"It came very quickly at night,\" Taisiya, 71, told Reuters in Orenburg, a city of 550,000 about 1,200 km (750 miles) east of Moscow. \"By the time I got ready, I couldn't get out.\"\n\nWhole areas of the city were underwater, and the Ural rose another 32 cm (13 inches) to 10.54 meters (34.6 ft), 124 cm (49 inches) above the level considered by local authorities as safe. Officials warned the river would rise further.\n\nThe flooding has struck Russia's Urals and the northern Kazakhstan worst, though waters are also rising southern parts of Western Siberia, the largest hydrocarbon basin in the world, and in some places near the Volga, Europe's biggest river.\n\nWater levels were also rising in Siberia's Tomsk, which sits on the Tom River, a tributary of the Ob, and in Kurgan, which straddles the Tobol river.\n\nAfter the Ural burst through dam embankments in Orsk, upstream from Orenburg, on Friday, some residents expressed anger over how local officials had handled the situation, demanding greater compensation and begging for help from President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin was being updated regularly on the situation but had no current plans to visit the area while emergency services tried to deal with rising waters.\n\nIn Orenburg, some residents expressed disappointment that local officials had not done enough to prepare for the annual snow melt.\n\n\"There is a lot of excitement, indignation and strong emotions that I understand and share,\" Orenburg Mayor Sergei Salmin said. \"The issue of receiving compensation and the procedure for processing payments is one of the main ones.\"\n\nSNOW MELT\n\nSpring flooding is a usual part of life across Russia - which has an area equal to the United States and Australia combined - as the heavy winter snows melt, swelling some of mighty rivers of Russia and Central Asia.\n\nThis year, though, a combination of factors triggered unusually severe flooding, according to emergency workers.\n\nThey said soils were waterlogged before winter and then was frozen under deep snow falls which melted very fast in rising spring temperatures and heavy rains.\n\nClimate researchers have long warned that rising temperatures could increase the incidence of extreme weather events, and that heavily forested Russia is of major importance in the global climate equation.\n\nIn Kurgan, a region which straddles the Tobol river, water levels rose in Zverinogolovkoye beyond the critical 10 meter (33 foot) mark, said Governor Vadim Shumkov who was shown visiting evacuated families.\n\nKazakhstan has been badly hit.\n\nThe emergencies ministry said on Thursday morning that the number of evacuees stood at over 97,000, unchanged from Wednesday, and a state of emergency remained in effect in eight regions of the country.\n\nEmergency workers have removed 8.8 million cubic meters (310 million cubic feet) of water from flooded areas, the ministry said. The Kazakh government also said movement was restricted on hundreds of kilometers of roads in the Aktobe, Akmola, Atyrau, Kostanai, Mangistau and North Kazakhstan regions.",
