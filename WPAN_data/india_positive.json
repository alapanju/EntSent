The projects encompass important sectors like health, road, rail, energy, petroleum & natural gas, and tourism among others.\n\nAddressing the gathering, the Prime Minister acknowledged the virtual presence of Hon'ble Governors and Chief Ministers of States, Members of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies and Union Ministers and thanked them. The Prime Minister recalled the time when all key development programs were carried out in New Delhi alone and highlighted that the present government changed the trend and took the Government of India to every corner of the nation. \"Today's organization in Rajkot is a proof of this belief\", PM Modi said, underlining that the dedication and foundation stone laying ceremony is taking place in multiple locations in the country as it takes forward a new tradition. Recalling the inauguration of educational institutions of IIT Bhilai, IIT Tirupati, IIIT Kurnool, IIM Bodh Gaya, IIM Jammu, IIM Visakhapatnam and IIS Kanpur from a program in Jammu, Prime Minister Modi said that today marks the inauguration of AIIMS Rajkot, AIIMS Raebareli, AIIMS Mangalagiri, AIIMS Bathinda and AIIMS Kalyani. \"The developing India is getting work done at a fast pace, especially when you look at these 5 AIIMSs\", Shri Modi added.\n\nThe Prime Minister recalled his long association with Rajkot and said that 22 years ago he was elected MLA from here. On 25th February 22 years ago, he took oath as the MLA. He said that he has done his best to live up to the trust of the people of Rajkot. \"I can see that generations have changed but affection for Modi is beyond any age limit\", said a grateful Prime Minister.\n\nApologizing for the delay in today's programme, the Prime Minister told the audience about his activities in Dwaraka earlier during the day where he inaugurated and laid the foundation stones of many development works including Sudarsan Setu. He once again narrated his divine experience of offering prayer at the submerged holy city of Dwarka. \"Reading the archaeological and religious text fills us with wonder about Dwarka. Today I got an opportunity to see that holy scene with my own eyes and I could touch the holy remains. I offered prayers and offered 'Mor-Pankh' there. It is difficult to describe that feeling\", said the Prime Minister, still overcome with emotions from the experience. \"In those depths, I was wondering about the glorious past of India. When I came out, I came out carrying the blessings of Bhagwan Krishna as well as the inspiration of Dwarka\", the Prime Minister said. \"This gave a new strength and energy to my resolution of 'Vikas aur Virasat'. A divine belief has become associated with my goal for Viksit Bharat\", he added.\n\nNoting the development projects of today worth more than Rs 48,000 crores, the Prime Minister mentioned the New Mundra-Panipat pipeline commissioned to transport crude oil from the Gujarat coast to Indian Oil's refinery in Panipat in Haryana. He also mentioned projects related to roads, railways, electricity, health and education. \"AIIMS Rajkot is now dedicated to the nation after the inauguration of the International Airport\", the Prime Minister said, congratulating the people of Rajkot and Saurashtra. He also conveyed his best wishes to citizens of all cities where AIIMS is being inaugurated today.\n\n\"Today marks a historic occasion not just for Rajkot but the entire nation\", Prime Minister Modi said, highlighting that Rajkot today presents a glimpse of the desired levels of health facilities in Viksit Bharat. He pointed out that the nation had only one AIIMS for 50 years of independence, that too in Delhi. He added that even though only seven AIIMS were commissioned during the seven decades of independence, some of them couldn't be completed. \"In the last 10 days, the nation has witnessed the foundation stone laying and inauguration of seven new AIIMS\", the Prime Minister remarked, highlighting that the present government has accomplished things at a faster pace than what was done in the last 70 years, thereby taking the country on the path of development. He also mentioned laying the foundation stone and dedicating more than 200 health infrastructure projects including medical colleges, satellite centers of multi-speciality hospitals and centers for the treatment of worrying ailments.\n\nReiterating the promise of 'Modi ki Guarantee meaning the guarantee of fulfillment of guarantee' the Prime Minister said that the foundation stone for Rajkot AIIMS was laid by him 3 years ago and today that guarantee was fulfilled. Similarly, a guarantee of an AIIMS was given to Punjab and the foundation stone as well as inauguration was done by PM Modi. The same cycle has taken place for Raebareli, Mangalgiri, Kalyani, and Rewari AIIMS. In the last 10 years, 10 new AIIMS have been sanctioned in different states. \"Modi ki guarantee begins where expectations from others end\", said PM Modi.\n\nThe Prime Minister said that the pandemic could be handled in a credible manner due to the improvements in the healthcare system and infrastructure in the last 10 years. He mentioned the unprecedented expansion of AIIMS, Medical Colleges and Critical Care Infrastructure. There are more than 1.5 lakh Ayushman Arogya Mandirs in villages for small ailments. The Prime Minister said that today, the number of medical colleges has reached 706 from 387 in 2014, more than 1 lakh MBBS seats from 50 thousand ten years ago, 70 thousand post-graduate seats, up from 30 thousand in 2014. More doctors will come out of these colleges in the next few years than the number of doctors in the entire 70 years since independence, he said. There are 64 thousand crore rupees worth Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission going on in the country. Today's event also saw projects like medical colleges, TB hospital and research center, PGI satellite center, critical care blocks and dozens of ESIC hospitals.\n\n\"Government prioritizes the prevention of disease as well as the capacity to fight it\", the Prime Minister said, highlighting the emphasis on nutrition, Yoga, Ayush and cleanliness. He underlined the commitment to promoting both traditional Indian medicine and modern medicine and gave examples of the two big hospitals and research centers related to Yoga and Naturopathy being inaugurated in Maharashtra and Haryana today. He also mentioned WHO's global center related to the traditional medical system is also being built here in Gujarat.\n\nIn a bid towards helping the poor and middle class save money while also availing better healthcare facilities, the Prime Minister threw light on the Ayushman Bharat Yojna which has helped save Rs 1 lakh crore, and Jan Aushadhi Centers that provide medicines at an 80% discount thereby saving Rs 30 thousand crores. Under the Ujjwala Yojna, the poor have saved more than Rs 70,000 crores, citizens have saved Rs 4,000 every month due to low cost of mobile data and taxpayers have saved about Rs 2.5 lakh crores due to tax-related reforms.\n\nThe Prime Minister also elaborated on the PM Suryaghar Scheme that will bring the electricity bill to zero and will create income for the families. Beneficiaries will get 300 units of free electricity and the remaining power will be purchased by the government. He also mentioned large wind energy and solar projects such as two plants in Kutch for which foundation stones were laid today.\n\nNoting that Rajkot is a city of workers, entrepreneurs and artisans, the Prime Minister talked about PM Vishwakarma Yojana worth Rs 13,000 crores benefitting lakhs of Vishwakarmas. In Gujarat only 20,000 Vishwakarmas have already been trained and every Vishwakarma received an assistance of Rs 15,000. He also informed that in PM SVANidhi scheme, assistance of Rs 10,000 crores has been disbursed to street vendors. Street vendors of Gujarat received about Rs 800 crores worth of assistance. In Rajkot itself, more than 30,000 loans have been disbursed, he said.\n\nThe Prime Minister underlined that the mission of Viksit Bharat gets stronger when the citizens of India get empowered. \"When Modi guarantees to make India the world's third largest economic superpower, the goal is health for all and prosperity for all\", the Prime Minister concluded.\n\nChief Minister of Gujarat, Shri Bhupendra Patel, Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare, Dr Mansukh Mandaviya and Member of Parliament, Shri C R Patil were present on the occasion among others.\n\nBackground\n\nIn a significant step towards strengthening tertiary health care in the country, the Prime Minister dedicated to the nation five All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) at Rajkot (Gujarat), Bathinda (Punjab), Raebareli (Uttar Pradesh), Kalyani (West Bengal) and Mangalagiri (Andhra Pradesh).\n\nThe Prime Minister laid the foundation stone and dedicated to the nation more than 200 Health Care Infrastructure Projects worth more than Rs 11,500 crore across 23 States /UTs.\n\nThe Prime Minister dedicated the Medical College of JIPMER at Karaikal, Puducherry and 300 bedded Satellite Centre of Post Graduate Institute of Medical and Educational Research (PGIMER) in Sangrur, Punjab among others.

But the saffron party, which won 73 and 62 LS seats from the state in the 2014 and 2019 elections respectively, is convinced that it is 'achievable' given the 'groundswell of support' in its favour, particularly after the consecration of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya on January 22 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"The NDA government led by Narendra Modi has done its job.

        "text": "Dr Jitendra Singh thanked the organisers for taking the lead for a synergised and equitable relationship with the government for optimum outcomes.\n\nUnion Minister of State (Independent Charge) Science & Technology; MoS PMO, Personnel, Public Grievances, Pensions, Atomic Energy and Space, Dr Jitendra Singh today said that Artificial Intelligence is revolutionising clinical medicine at a very fast pace and there is an urgent need for optimum integration between the existing and the newer tools of patient care.\n\nAt the same time, he said, integration is also required at a different level between the public and private sectors on the one hand and on the other hand among various systems of medical practice combining allopathy with AYUSH to achieve the envisaged health goals through a synergised approach.\n\nSpeaking as chief guest in the inaugural session of 2-day \"International Patient Safety Conference 2024\" in Bengaluru, Dr Jitendra Singh said, India's recent success stories which have been hailed worldwide including the vaccine story, have proved beyond evidence that working in silos or in isolation has its limitations and further growth from here on is possible only through an integration at multiple levels.\n\nDr Jitendra Singh said, for the first time after Independence, the healthcare sector has received top priority under Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. PM Modi spoke about Digital Health from the ramparts of the Red Fort on Independence Day, he recalled.\n\nA renowned diabetologist himself, Dr Jitendra Singh called for strong Public Private extended integration for optimum results. He gave the example of a recently introduced Ph.D course in Biosciences, which is multiple in nature and even B.Tech or M. Tech streams could join.\n\nElaborating further on integration of various streams of healthcare, Dr Jitendra Singh pointed out that during the COVID even the West started looking up to India in search of immunity building techniques drawn from Ayurveda, Homoeopathy, Unani, Yoga, Naturopathy and other oriental alternatives. He said, however, even after the COVID phase passes out, an optimum integration and synergism of different streams of medical management are the key to successful management of various diseases and disorders which may not be otherwise completely amenable to treatment by any single stream of medicine or the treatment given in silos.\n\nDr Jitendra Singh said that ever since Shri Narendra Modi took over as Prime Minister of India in 2014, he has brought to the centre stage the virtues of indigenous systems of medical management. He said, it was PM Modi who brought a unanimous resolution in the United Nations to observe International Day of Yoga, as a result of which Yoga has reached virtually every household across the world. Again it was PM Modi's initiative that we have celebrated the International Year of Millets in 2023 to spread the virtues of Millets and other coarse grains to the world.\n\nReferring to the PPP model, Dr Jitendra Singh said, India has witnessed investment of over Rs 1,000 crore in Space Startups in the last nine months of the current financial year from April to December 2023. This has been possible because in a bold decision taken by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, India's Space sector has been opened up for private players, as a result of which there is an overwhelming response from Industry as well as investors from private sector, the Minister added.\n\nSimilarly, Dr Jitendra Singh said that our Bio-economy witnessed double digit growth rate year-on-year in the last 9/10 years under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi. \"In 2014, India's bioeconomy stood at just about $10 Billion. This fiscal we are likely to touch $150 billion and we look forward to having $300 Billion by 2030,\" he said.\n\nDr Jitendra Singh said, India has made rapid strides in the last 8/9 years. \"We had just 55 (Biotech) Startups in 2014, now we have more than 6,000,\" he said. Today there are over 3,000 Agritech Startups and are very successful in areas like Aroma Mission and Purple Revolution.\n\nStating that the \"Anusandhan National Research Foundation\" will pave the way for a greater PPP model in scientific research, Dr Jitendra Singh said the NRF will catapult us to the league of a handful of Developed nations pioneering new research in new frontiers. \"NRF budget envisions a spending of Rs. 50,000 crore over five years, out of which over 70% will come from non-government sources, including domestic as well as outside sources,\" he said.\n\nDr Jitendra Singh thanked the organisers for taking the lead for a synergised and equitable relationship with the government for optimum outcomes. He also thanked them for taking the lead in bringing a new genre of AI and other technological tools for patient and clinical medicine.\n\nDr Jitendra Singh said, Apollo Hospitals has also played a pioneering role fulfilling the vision of its founder Dr Pratap Reddy in addressing societal needs during the tough times of COVID.",

The development projects of today cater to important sectors such as road, rail, aviation, tourism, education, health, drinking water, urban development, and sanitation.\n\nAddressing the gathering, the Prime Minister expressed gratitude for being present in Kashi once again and recalled being elected as the Parliamentarian of the city 10 years ago. He said that in these 10 years, Banaras has transformed him into a Banarasi. Shri Modi lauded the support and contributions of the people of Kashi and said that the campaign to create a New Kashi is underway with the development projects of today worth more than Rs 13,000 crores. He said that development projects ranging from sectors of rail, road, airport-related projects, animal husbandry, industry, sports, skill development, cleanliness, health, spirituality, tourism, and LPG gas among others will give impetus to the development of not just Kashi but the entire Purvanchal region. It will also create new employment opportunities, he added. The Prime Minister also mentioned the projects related to Sant Ravidas ji and congratulated the citizens.\n\nExpressing his happiness about the development projects in Kashi and Eastern Uttar Pradesh, the Prime Minister recalled his road trip last night on his way to the Guest House and noted the benefits of the Phulwaria flyover project. He also noted the improvement of ease in the journey from BLW to the airport. The Prime Minister inspected the development project last night immediately after landing from his Gujarat trip. Talking about the development push in the last 10 years, the Prime Minister said that Sigra Sports Stadium Phase-1 and District Rifle Shooting Range will greatly benefit the young athletes of the region.\n\nThe Prime Minister mentioned visiting the Banas Dairy and interacting with several pashupalaks women earlier in the day. He said that women belonging to agricultural backgrounds were provided with indigenous breeds of Gir Gai 2-3 years ago to raise awareness. Noting that the number of Gir Gais has now reached almost 350, the Prime Minister informed that they produce up to 15 liters of milk compared to 5 liters produced by ordinary cows. He added that one such Gir Gai is producing 20 liters of milk creating additional income for women making them Lakhpati Didis. \"This is a huge inspiration for the 10 crore women associated with self-help groups in the country\", he added.\n\nRecalling the event of the foundation stone laying of Banas Dairy two years ago, the Prime Minister said that the guarantee given on that day is in front of the people today. He said Banas Dairy is a good example of creation of jobs through the right investment. Banas Dairy collects about 2 lakh liters of milk from Varanasi, Mirzapur, Gazipur and Raebareli. With the start of the new plant, Pashupalaks of Ballia, Chandauli, Prayagraj and Jaunpur will also benefit. Under the project, new Milk Mandis will come up in more than 1000 villages in Varanasi, Jaunpur, Chandauli, Gazipur and Azamgarh districts.\n\nThe Prime Minister emphasized that the Banas Kashi Sankul will create thousands of new employment opportunities. According to an estimate, the Prime Minister said, Banas Kashi Sankul will give a boost to the income of more than 3 lakh farmers. He informed that the unit will also undertake the manufacturing of other dairy products such as buttermilk, curd, lassi, ice cream, paneer and regional sweets. PM Modi underlined that the plant will play a key role in taking the sweets of Banaras to every corner of India. He also touched upon milk transportation as a means of employment and a boost for the animal nutrition industry.\n\nThe Prime Minister requested the leadership of the dairy to develop a system of transferring money directly to the accounts of the Pashupalak sisters digitally, noting the preponderance of women in the dairy sector. The Prime Minister underlined the role of animal husbandry in helping small farmers and landless laborers.\n\nThe Prime Minister reiterated the government's resolve to make annadata from Urja Data to Urwarakdata. He informed about the opportunity in Gobar Dhan and talked about the plant in the dairy for making Bio CNG and organic manure. Noting the increasing trend of natural farming on the bank of the river Ganga, the Prime Minister acknowledged the utility of organic manure under Gobar Dhan Scheme. Referring to urban waste to Charcoal Plant by NTPC, the Prime Minister praised Kashi's spirit of turning 'Kachra into Kanchan'.\n\nThe Prime Minister said that Kisan aur Pashupalak is the greatest priority of the government. He mentioned FRP revision of Sugarcane in the last Cabinet meeting to 340 rs per quintal and easing of Pashudhan Bima Karyakram with an amendment in the national livestock mission. He said not only arrears of the farmers are being cleared, but prices of the crops are also being increased.\n\n\"Atmanirbhar Bharat will become the foundation for Viksit Bharat\", the Prime Minister said, highlighting the difference between the thought process of the previous and the present government. He emphasized that Atmanirbhar Bharat will become a reality only when the smaller possibilities in the country are reenergized, and the small farmers, pashupalaks, craftsmen and small and medium industries are provided assistance. The Prime Minister said that the call for Vocal for Local is an advertisement for the small players in the market who cannot spend on television and newspaper commercials. \"Modi himself advertises those who produce indigenous goods\", he said, \"Modi is the ambassador of every small farmer and industry, be it the promotion of Khadi, toy manufacturers, Make in India, or Dekho Apna Desh.\" He observed that the impact of such a call can be witnessed in Kashi itself where more than 12 crore tourists have visited the city since the rejuvenation of Vishwanath Dham leading to a surge in income and employment opportunities. Referring to the launch of electric catamaran vessel provided by Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) for Varanasi & Ayodhya, PM Modi said that it will create a unique experience for those visiting.\n\nThe Prime Minister also elaborated on the ill-effect of dynasty politics, corruption and appeasement in the earlier times. He also criticized the maligning of the youth of Kashi by certain quarters. He highlighted the contradiction between the growth of youth and dynasty politics. He also noted the hatred for new form of Kashi and Ayodhya among these forces.\n\n\"Modi's third term will bring India's capabilities to the forefront of the world and India's economic, social, strategic, and cultural sectors will be at new heights\", the Prime Minister remarked. Highlighting India's progress, the Prime Minister mentioned leapfrogging to 5th largest economy in the world from 11th in the last 10 years. He further added that India will become the 3rd largest economy in the next 5 years. PM Modi affirmed the belief that developmental works such as Digital India, widening of roads, modernized railway stations, and Vande Bharat, Amrit Bharat, and Namo Bharat trains will be accelerated in the next 5 years. \"Modi's guarantee to make Eastern India the growth engine of Viksit Bharat\", PM Modi said pointing out that the region had been deprived of development. Speaking about the inauguration of the first phase of the six-lane highway from Varanasi to Aurangabad, the Prime Minister said that the completion of the Varanasi-Ranchi-Kolkata Expressway in the coming 5 years will reduce the distance between UP, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. \"In future, the travel time from Banaras to Kolkata is going to be almost halved\", he added.\n\nThe Prime Minister anticipated new dimensions of Kashi's development in the coming 5 years. He mentioned Kashi Ropeway and the exponential rise in airport capacity. He said that Kashi will emerge as an important sports city in the country. He also acknowledged Kashi as a major contributor to the Make in India and Aatmnirbhar Bharat Abhiyan. He informed that in the next 5 years, Kashi will be a hub of employment and skills. During this period the National Institution of Fashion Technology campus will also be completed which will create new opportunities for the youth and weavers of the area. \"In the last decade, we have given a new identity to Kashi as a hub of health and education.

        "text": "Jammu and Kashmir has become a beacon of hope and opportunity for sports development, thanks to concerted efforts by both the central and local administrations. The recent inauguration of the 4th Khelo India Winter Games at Gulmarg, a world-renowned ski resort, serves as a testament to the unwavering commitment towards fostering a robust sports culture in the region. The significance of this event is not just as a sporting spectacle but as a symbol of unity, peace, and progress. Over the years, Jammu and Kashmir has witnessed a transformative journey in sports development, buoyed by the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nThe investment in state-of-the-art infrastructure, coupled with a focus on grassroots development, has laid a strong foundation for nurturing sporting talent across cities and villages. One cannot overlook the pivotal role played by the Khelo India initiative in catalyzing this transformation. By providing a platform for young athletes to showcase their skills and compete at national and international levels, Khelo India has ignited a spark of enthusiasm and aspiration among the youth. The Winter Games, with their emphasis on disciplines like Alpine skiing, Nordic skiing, and snow mountaineering, not only harness the region's natural resources but also offer avenues for economic growth through sports tourism.\n\nAthletes hailing from the UT of J&K have etched an indelible mark in the annals of sporting history by clinching an astounding 46 medals in the 37th National Games in Goa. Notably, the J&K contingent secured positions within the top 12 performers in the overall game standings. Recent advancements in sports infrastructure, extending even to the grassroots level in villages, have resulted in a veritable transformation in the sporting landscape. The exceptional success story of Sheetal Devi, who became the first armless archer to win gold at the Paralympic Games, is an example of how talent is being taken care of now in UT. The success stories of UT's sportspeople under the present regime are exceptional. Legends Cricket matches at MA Stadium after decades is another success story.\n\nHowever, the journey towards sports development is not without its challenges. Infrastructure development, talent identification, and access to coaching remain areas that require sustained attention and investment. It is heartening to note the proactive measures undertaken by the Government, in collaboration with various stakeholders, to address these bottlenecks and create an ecosystem conducive to sporting excellence. Jammu and Kashmir's Administrative Council has approved the establishment of the \"Jammu and Kashmir Sports Cadre\" under the administrative jurisdiction of the Youth Service and Sports Department. Overall, 235 cadre posts, including 10 posts reserved for the appointment of exceptional sports individuals, will be created.\n\nInitiatives like the PMDP, which focuses on the holistic development of Jammu and Kashmir, including the enhancement of sports infrastructure, are commendable steps in this direction. The building of sports stadiums at Banihal and Roun in Udhampur is one of the initiatives that have made dreams come true for the youth of the region. The upcoming Arun Jaitley International Stadium at Hiranagar and other stadiums' upgrades and renovations are testimony to the efforts of the Government towards sports in Jammu and Kashmir. The completion of numerous projects under JKIDFC and CAPEX, along with the participation of lakhs of children and youth in sports activities, are a testimony to the impetus Jammu and Kashmir's sports infrastructure has gotten under the present administration. Academies have been established for young athletes in gymnastics, judo, football, and cricket to develop their talent early.\n\nWith the success of the Khelo India Winter Games, it is imperative to recognise the role of all stakeholders-from policymakers to coaches, administrators to parents-in nurturing the next generation of sporting talent. The convergence of efforts, fuelled by a shared vision of a healthier, more vibrant society, is what will drive Jammu and Kashmir towards greater heights in the realm of sports.",

We expect that after the Relics have arrived here, the bond of friendship and love between these two countries will strengthen. May lord Buddha bless these two countries with peace, prosperity and development. We are going to write a new chapter in our bilateral relations,\" he added.\n\nA momentous occasion, steeped in religious significance, the sacred relics attributed to Lord Buddha and his revered disciples, Arahata Sariputta and Arahata Maha Moggallana, have arrived in Thailand for public exposition.\n\nThe holy relics were preserved in India and for the first time, the relics of Lord Buddha and his disciples will be showcased together. The arrival of these relics heralds a period of spiritual reflection and devotion for Buddhist practitioners across Thailand.\n\nThe exposition of these relics provides devotees and the general public with a rare opportunity to pay homage, offer prayers, and deepen their spiritual connection to the foundational figures of Buddhism.\n\nIn this sacred journey, Bihar's Governor, Rajendra Arlekar, and Union Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment, Dr Virendra Kumar, have also accompanied him to Thailand.\n\n\"A high-level delegation led by Governor of Bihar, Rajendra Arlekar and Union Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment Dr Virendra Kumar accompanies the relics to Thailand.

More than 90 per cent of the population in Thailand is Buddhist. These relics, especially those of Lord Buddha, are the living embodiment of the Lord. It's a very big event, and it also coincides with the 72nd birth year of the king, Rama 10th.\"\n\nIn Bangkok, the relics will be enshrined and prominently displayed for public veneration, offering devotees a rare opportunity to pay homage and seek blessings.\n\nThe exposition of these relics serves as a spiritual beacon, drawing pilgrims and seekers from far and wide to partake in this sacred experience.\n\nThe convergence of the Holy Buddha Relic and the relics of Arhant Sariputta and Arhant Mahamogallana epitomises the timeless bond between the teacher and his foremost disciples.\n\nBeyond religious symbolism, the exposition of these sacred relics embodies the universal values of compassion, wisdom, and inner peace, resonating with seekers of truth across the globe.

It is our steadfast resolve to be the first responder and the preferred security partner in the IOR, and for the peace, stability and prosperity of the wider Indo-Pacific,\" said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.\n\nAddressing the formal opening ceremony of the 12 edition of MILAN 2024 in Visakhapatnam on Wednesday, he reiterated that India will continue to play the role of a 'Vishwa Mitra' in forging meaningful partnerships that make the world a truly connected and equitable habitat for the humanity as a whole.\n\nThe event was graced by Chief of Naval Staff Admiral R Hari Kumar and a distinguished gathering of ministers, ambassadors, Chiefs of foreign navies and representatives of maritime forces from over 50 friendly countries.\n\nThe Defence Minister called upon the international community to collectively aspire for peace in this age of democratic and rules-based world order, where individual countries proactively collaborate for shared peace and prosperity.\n\nAsserting that the absence of wars and conflicts is the most irreducible minimum element of peace, he spoke of \"negative peace\" which, he said, often stems from dominance or hegemony, where one power imposes its will upon others. \"Such peace, not backed by fairness and justice, is what physicists and economists call \"unstable equilibrium\",\" he added.\n\nHe further elaborated on what he called \"cold peace\" where parties do not kill each other in the open, but do their best to undermine one another. Describing \"cold peace\" as merely an interval between direct conflicts, Rajnath Singh said, \"The positive peace is the shared peace of one and all, with the cooperation of one and all. There is no Indian peace or Australian peace or Japanese peace, rather it is the shared global peace. This sentiment was also eloquently set forth by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he said 'This is not an era of war. But it is one of dialogue and diplomacy'.\"\n\nRajnath Singh batted for peace and shared goodness, he assured that \"We will not shrink from countering any threat that undermines our collective well-being, piracy and trafficking included\". He referred to the recent events in the Western Indian Ocean which have brought to the fore some pressing challenges in the maritime domain, ranging from attacks on merchant shipping to piracy and hijacking attempts.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Admiral Hari Kumar said underpinned by Government of India's vision of Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR), MILAN encapsulates and rejuvenates the unrelenting spirit of 'Cohesion, Camaraderie and Collaboration.' From five IOR navies in 1995 to 50 navies across the Indo-Pacific today, MILAN reflects the growing stature and increasing importance of such collective and cooperative endeavours in the maritime domain, he said.\n\nThe Chief of the Naval Staff informed that the Harbour Phase, which is underway, has seen insightful discussions through Subject Matter Expert Exchanges and Table Top Exercises.\n\nAdmiral R Hari Kumar added that the Sea Phase commencing on February 24 will witness Indian and foreign warships sailing in unison and participating in an array of operational drills pushing the collective boundaries and refining the skills together.",

        "text": "His visit will strengthen the party's appeal in the region through a narrative of progress, prosperity, and proactive governance\n\nAs the Prime Minister Narendra Modi prepares for his upcoming visit to Jammu on February 20, 2024, the anticipation among the citizens of Jammu and Kashmir is palpable. This visit isn't merely ceremonial; it's a meticulously strategically timed to amplify the government's developmental agenda and strengthen its bond with the people of Jammu and Kashmir who with their open arms welcome the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and are ready to follow the path which his vision has created. I remember Majrooh Sultanpuri's couplet,\n\nThe upcoming visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi carries immense developmental significance and the Modi-led government's proactive stance towards operationalizing a slew of developmental initiatives in Jammu and Kashmir. With a combined investment exceeding Rs 30,500 crore, the inauguration, dedication, and foundation laying ceremonies for various projects symbolize a strategic move towards strengthening socio-economic infrastructure. This approach, spanning healthcare, education, transportation, infrastructure, and civic amenities, represents the Modi-led government's commitment to steering the region towards comprehensive progress and inclusive development. The Prime Minister's engagement during the event, including the distribution of appointment orders to approximately 1500 new government recruits and his slated interaction with beneficiaries of various government schemes under the 'Viksit Bharat Viksit Jammu' program, resonates deeply with the political mantra of\n\n\"Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas, Sabka Vishwaas, Sabka Prayaas.\"\n\nI remember Makhdoom Mohiuddin's couplet that resonates with the mantra,\n\nThe Prime Minister Modi's visit will be the monumental boost to the education sector, with the inauguration and laying of foundation stones of various developmental projects including the prestigious institutions such as IIT Jammu, IIM Jammu, and these educational landmarks not only signify a paradigm shift in Jammu and Kashmir's academic landscape but also serve as catalysts for nurturing talent, innovation, and driving socio-economic transformation across.\n\nThe inauguration of the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Jammu, symbolizes a pivotal moment in the developmental landscape, a strategic investment in the region's healthcare infrastructure. This grand inauguration will usher a new era of healthcare accessibility and excellence, strategically positioning AIIMS Jammu as a cornerstone in the provision of medical services for the people of Jammu and Kashmir. With a staggering investment exceeding 1660 crore and sprawling across 227 acres, AIIMS Jammu will emerge as a beacon of modern healthcare infrastructure that will cater to the diverse needs of patients and medical professionals alike.\n\nThe imminent visit of Prime Minister Narendra Modi not only emphasizes the government's steadfast commitment to healthcare and job provisions, but will also strengthen connectivity and transportation\n\ninfrastructure in the region that also represents a big step to wield connection with masses through the developmental projects. With a visionary eye on progress, the Prime Minister will inaugurate the rail projects, laying the cornerstone for expansive road networks, and the groundbreaking ceremony for state- of-the-art airport terminals. These transformative endeavors not only streamline travel logistics but also serve as catalysts for economic dynamism, tourism revitalization, and the amplification of trade prospects. Of particular note is the forthcoming laying of the foundation stone for a cutting-edge terminal building at Jammu Airport, spanning an impressive 40,000 square meters. By fortifying air connectivity, invigorating tourism, and propelling commercial activity, this landmark infrastructure initiative promises to act as an essential cornerstone in propelling the region's economic route towards unprecedented heights.\n\nIn a historic step towards fulfilling the enduring aspirations of the people of Jammu and Kashmir for robust connections with the mainland India, the scenario is set to be transformed by the inauguration of pioneering rail networks. Manzoor Hashmi has rightly said:\n\n\"yaqin ho to koi rasta nikalta hai, Hawa ki ott bhi lekar Chairag Jalta hai\".\n\nWith this confidence, we are sure that in another couple of years, J&K will be a completely different and a transformed region. Spearheaded by the Narendra Modi, the unveiling of the new rail line traversing Banihal-Khari-Sumber-Sangaldan (48 Km) and the electrification of the Baramulla-Srinagar-Banihal- Sangaldan stretch (185.66 Km) will write a new chapter in the region's transportation saga. This transformative journey, the inaugural run of the valley's maiden electric train and the maiden service\n\nbetween Sangaldan and Baramulla stations will mark a symbolic union of progress and prosperity. Beyond mere infrastructure, these rail projects stand as beacons of connectivity, indicating a sustainable future and igniting the flames of economic revitalization across the region.\n\nWitnessing a surge in nationwide road connectivity efforts, Prime Minister Modi's vision of \"connecting Jammu and Kashmir\" is swiftly materializing with the initiation of pivotal road projects. These include two segments (44.22 KM) of the Delhi-Amritsar-Katra Expressway, linking Jammu to Katra, and Phase two of the four-laning of Srinagar Ring Road. Five packages for enhancing the 161 km long Srinagar-Baramulla- Uri stretch of NH-01 and the construction of Kulgam Bypass & Pulwama Bypass on NH-444 further strengthen the regional infrastructure.\n\nIn a historic move to strengthen the infrastructure and public amenities, the Prime Minister will lay the foundation stone for a cutting-edge Common User Facility (CUF) Petroleum depot in Jammu, a project valued at Rs 677 crore. This state-of-the-art automated depot will boast a storage capacity of 100,000 KL, accommodating various fuels including Motor Spirit, High Speed Diesel, and Aviation Turbine Fuel, among others.\n\nMoreover, the Prime Minister is set to inaugurate and initiate a slew of development projects worth over Rs 3150 crore for strengthening the civic infrastructure and provisioning of public facilities across Jammu and Kashmir. The projects to be inaugurated by Prime Minister include, Road projects & Bridges; Grid Stations, receiving stations transmission line Projects; Common Effluent Treatment Plants and Sewage Treatment Plants; Several Degree College buildings; Intelligent Traffic Management system in Srinagar city; Modern Narwal Fruit Mandi; Drug Testing Laboratory at Kathua; and Transit accommodation - 224 flats at Ganderbal and Kupwara. Beyond the veneer of development, Prime Minister Modi's visit to Jammu carries developmental initiatives and engaging directly with beneficiaries, and its obvious that his visit will strengthen the party's appeal in the region through a narrative of progress, prosperity, and proactive governance, thereby validating the slogan,\n\n'Teesri baar Modi Sarkar, ab ki baar 400 paar'.\n\nIn this essence, Prime Minister Modi's visit to the region epitomizes a bold vision for a transformed Jammu and Kashmir, characterized by infrastructure, thriving institutions, and empowered communities. As the region lines on a new line of growth and development, guided by the Narendra Modi's visionary leadership, the promise of a brighter future beckons, beckoning all stakeholders to unite in the pursuit of a Viksit Bharat, a Viksit Jammu, and a Viksit Kashmir. I wholeheartedly welcome the visionary and a statesman to the land of temples. Let me conclude by Meer Taqi Meer's couplet,\n\n\"Bare duniya me raho gham-zada ya shaad raho, Aisa kuchh kar ke chalo yaan ki bahut yaad raho,\"\n\nand yes, our Prime Minister, you will be remembered forever for your visionary and statesmanship.",

        "text": "The Sunday Guardian's Prestigious Friends of Mumbai Awards & Conclave: A Dazzling Tribute to City Icons\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing the National Convention of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at Delhi's Bharat Mandapam, took a sharp swipe at opposition parties, accusing them of lacking in the fulfillment of promises while excelling in making false pledges.\n\nDuring his speech on the concluding day of the convention, PM Modi emphasized the stark contrast between the BJP's commitment to development and what he described as the opposition's failure to deliver on their promises. He reiterated his party's pledge for a 'Viksit Bharat' (Developed India) and asserted that while the opposition may shy away from similar promises, the BJP is steadfast in its determination to make India the world's third-largest economy during its third term, branding it as \"Modi ki Guarantee.\"\n\nPM Modi outlined the tangible benefits of achieving such a milestone, including the upliftment of living standards, increased incomes, modernization of public transport, expanded employment opportunities, empowerment of women, and the integration of modern technologies in agriculture to benefit farmers.\n\nHighlighting the participatory approach of the government in shaping the vision of 'Viksit Bharat', PM Modi disclosed that over 15 lakh people, with a significant portion being youth, have contributed suggestions and ideas toward this goal. He emphasized the importance of harnessing the energy of India's youth, announcing preparations for the Youth Olympics in 2029 and laying the groundwork for India to host the Olympics in 2036.\n\nMoreover, PM Modi outlined various initiatives aimed at reducing India's carbon footprint, such as making Indian Railways carbon-free and promoting 'green jobs' to decrease dependency on other nations. He also highlighted efforts to bolster the agricultural sector through initiatives like the 'Amrit Sarovar' campaign, which has seen the construction of over 60,000 ponds across the country to benefit farmers.\n\nThe Prime Minister's address underlines the BJP's commitment to realizing its vision of a prosperous and developed India while taking a dig at the opposition's perceived lack of credibility in delivering on their promises.",

Nadda congratulated PM Modi for successfully conducting the consecration of the temple, which was celebrated as a national festival.\n\nThe BJP national convention hailed PM Modi Modi saying the dream of \"every Indian\" was realised and Ram Lalla returned \"home\". The resolution stated that the BJP, ever since its inception, was committed to the construction of a grand temple at the birthplace of Lord Ram.\n\nThe resolution stated that \"the Constitution, dedicated to our democratic values and justice for all, has been inspired by the ideals of Ram Rajya\".\n\n\"Even in the original copy of the Constitution of India, on the section of fundamental rights, the picture of Lord Shri Ram, Mother Sita and Lakshman ji after returning to Ayodhya after the victory, is a proof of the fact that Lord Shri Ram is the source of inspiration for the fundamental rights,\" it said.\n\nFurther crediting PM Modi, it said, \"The temple of Lord Shri Ram will play a decisive role in fulfilling the resolutions that we have adopted in building Viksit Bharat. The Prime Minister has played an impeccable role in uniting the entire nation on this auspicious occasion associated with Lord Shri Ram,\" it said.\n\nReferring to the Ram Mandir as a symbol of India's vision, philosophy, and path, it said it has become a temple of national consciousness.\n\nAlthough the construction of the temple was cleared by the Supreme Court's order, the resolution commended the PM for accelerating the pace of work to ensure its timely completion.\n\n\"After the decision of the Supreme Court on 9 November 2019, the Central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi without any delay formed Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra, as a result of which the construction work of Shri Ram temple went on at a fast pace and within just four years, the consecration of the idol of Ramlalla was completed on 22 January 2024,\" the resolution stated.\n\nIt referred to January 22 as the day of aspiration and accomplishment for millions of Ram devotees, the renaissance of India's spiritual consciousness and the beginning of the journey back to great India.\n\n\"The grand and divine Ram Temple of Ayodhya is imprinted in the consciousness of every Indian and has become a reflection of the richness of cultural heritage. The nation, freeing itself from the mentality of slavery, creates a new history by taking inspiration from every part of the past,\" it said.\n\nThe resolution said the government has achieved \"unprecedented and remarkable success\" in preserving and promoting the cultural heritage of India. \"In the last ten years, the PM worked to connect the spiritual heritage of India with the unity of the country. Through his unwavering commitment towards religion, he started many such programs which are taking India towards a bright future,\" it said.",

Addressing the party's National Convention here, Nadda spoke of the BJP's commitment to construction of grand Ram temple in Ayodhya and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had led the rituals at the Pran Pratishtha event on January 22 in Ayodhya.\n\nTalking of BJP victories in assembly polls, Nadda said that there is an evident atmosphere of enthusiasm in the party rank and file but said there is a need to work hard to achieve the party's winning goals for the Lok Sabha polls expected to be held in April-May this year. \"We all here are happy and full of enthusiasm but with this we have to stay alert and work with full force to cross 370 (seats) and more than 400 for NDA. We have to cross 370 and for that, we have to work with full strength at every booth. Workers of BJP work very hard, I have full faith in you that you will fully immerse yourself, and BJP, under the leadership of Modiji, will score a hat-trick in the third term and will move forward by breaking record,\" Nadda said.\n\nPM Modi, in his speeches, has talked about the BJP having a target of winning over 370 seats on its own and over 400 seats with its NDA allies in Lok Sabha polls. The BJP-led government had scrapped Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir and party leaders have talked about it in their speeches. The BJP got an absolute majority in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and returned to power with a bigger maority in 2019. Nadda said PM Modi's leadership is transforming India in an unparalleled way.\n\n\"In every front, be it health, infrastructure, education or employment, PM Modi's leadership is fulfilling the dreams of every Indian. PM Modi's leadership is truly transforming India in an unparalleled way. Today, over 80 crore beneficiaries are getting free food grains under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana. Also, the last ten years under the Modi government have pulled around 25 crore people out of poverty, and given these people new wings to fly,\" Nadda said. \"Under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, over 4 crore people who earlier had temporary residences have now been reaping the benefits of permanent homes. The Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a scheme that has been annually providing financial aid to 55 crore people, while making arrangements for them to also be able to tackle serious diseases. If this has been made possible, it is because of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I would also like to bring to your knowledge that the Ayushman Bharat Scheme has become the world's largest health coverage programme,\" he added.\n\nHe talked about steps taken towards women's empowerment by the Modi government. \"More than 12 crore \"izzat ghar\" (toilets in rural households) have been built under the Swacch Bharat Abhiyan. We are not unaware of the fact that our mothers and sisters used to have issues regarding defecation. They used to set out every day in public areas. Today, the Modi government has not only empowered them but also provided them with a sense of dignity by providing over 12 crore rural toilets in their households,\" Nadda said.\n\n\"Our mothers and sisters used to go out into the forests to bring wood and then they used to work with smoke and cinders to burn the wood and prepare food. We have seen those days too but now, under the Ujala Yojana, our sisters and mothers have been empowered by receiving gas connections. Under the Saubhagya Yojana, over 2 crore homes have been electrified and under the Jal Jeevan mission, over 11 crore homes have been receiving water services with the focus on the mission of 'Har ghar jal har ghar nal,\" said Nadda. The party's national president also highlighted Lal Krishna Advani's contribution to the BJP.\n\n\"Lal Krishna Advani made an important contribution to building a huge party by spending his entire life. Apart from this, the wisdom with which he lived a long political and public life is an example for all of us. We also remember the service he provided to the country as the Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of India. I thank the Prime Minister for awarding 'Bharat Ratna' to such a senior leader,\" said Nadda. The BJP chief said India's stature has risen in the international arena in the Modi government.\n\n\"A tale of successful G20 Presidency, a history of making 2023 the 'International Year of Millets', a journey from Mangalyaan to Chandrayaan-3, each such stellar achievement became a reality during the last ten years only. Bharat, under PM Modi Ji's leadership, is shining bright not only on the earth but also in the sky,\" he said. He talked about the party's success in recent assembly polls including the party raising its vote share in Telangana.\n\nThe BJP is holding a two-day convention here as part of preparations for Lok Sabha polls.

When I participated at the KIYG, I saw how our state government made a wholehearted effort in arranging the event, and everyone loved it,\" she narrated.\n\n\"The arrangements were superb, everyone had said that the people were nice, the management was superb.

During KIYG, there were a lot of changes that the government invested in,\" she said.\n\n\"I never trained in Sarusajai but I saw that entire pool there is so well maintained. In the month of January, it's normally super cold in Guwahati, and they turn on the heater so that the swimmers could train in warm water. It's comfortable for the swimmers. The only thing Assam needs is more trained coaches as there is no dearth of talent in the state. But overall, Assam has all the facilities and the infrastructure to host multi-discipline events,\" she counted.\n\nThe ace swimmer felt that hosting the prestigious KIUG in the state will be a great learning experience for the budding athletes, as they will witness more than 4,500 athletes from over 200 universities in action.\n\n\"People will be more aware, as they will be watching the seniors and top university level athletes (in her case swimmers) competing.

We are extremely gratified to see them back in India,\" Kwatra said.\n\nSeven out of eight Indians had returned to India on Monday after Qatar freed them. The Navy veterans were on October 26 given death sentences by Qatar's Court of First Instance. The Court of Appeal in the Gulf nation on December 28 commuted the capital punishment and sentenced them to jail terms for varying durations.\n\nThe former Indian Navy personnel apparently faced charges of espionage, but neither the Qatari authorities nor New Delhi made the charges against them public.

        "text": "In a bid to boost domestic production of pulses, Union Food and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday said that the farmers are being encouraged to diversify into pulses from other crops through an assured five-year purchase contract. This initiative, first of its kind, is being implemented through Nafed and NCCF. He also said that 'Bharat Dal' has seen good traction in the market as it has captured 25 per cent market share within four months.\n\nSpeaking at a global event -- Pulses 24, organised by Global Pulse Confederation along with Nafed, Goyal said: \"Nafed and NCCF are encouraging our farmers to diversify out from other crops to pulses and are happy and willing to purchase pulses and lentils from them. This is being done by giving the assured contract for five years so that they increase production of pulses. They are also given an assurance that they will be getting an attractive price. I do believe this is a massive step of the Narendra Modi government to support and encourage the production and consumption of pulses including lentils in India.\"\n\nAlso read: Large scale demonstration of high yielding pulses planned in 2024 kharif: Munda High MSP\n\nHe added that the government supports farmers through procurement of pulses at Minimum Support Price (MSP), which is determined by an independent body CACP. \"The MSP in India today is assured at a price which is 50 per cent over the actual cost of production (A2+FL) thereby giving our farmers reasonable and attractive rate of returns for their farming activities. MSP is the highest today compared to the past with increases as high as 117 per cent in masur lentil, as high as 90 per cent in moong, 75 per cent higher in chana dal and 60 per cent more in tur and urad over what prevailed 10 years ago,\" he added.\n\nOver the last ten years, pulses production has increased by nearly 60 per cent to about 27 million tonnes. The government has recently launched Bharat branded wheat flour, rice and dal (processed pulses).\n\n\"In a matter of a very short span of time of four months, the Bharat dal has captured 25 per cent of India's market for chana dal. In most of the e-commerce sites where it is available, its ranking is far more superior than others. It clearly demonstrates that our farmers produce high quality pulses and those pulses when available at affordable prices with the support of government for the common man truly becomes the food of the common man, \" Goyal added.\n\nHe added that procurement of pulses has increased by 18 times in the past ten years. In 2015, with the introduction of buffer stock it was ensured that the government will have stocks available to moderate prices and price stability for consumers. \"These efforts helped ensure India were able to rein in food inflation when the developed world faced significant challenges of inflation. Our inflation was amongst the lowest in the world,\" Goyal stated.\n\nSHARE Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditPublished on February 15, 2024",

        "text": "While the formal declaration of this remarkable achievement is yet to be made, he asserted that the successful containment of encephalitis has emerged as a beacon of hope and a potential model for replication across the nation and beyond.\n\nUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday said that owing to the relentless efforts of the double-engine government, the scourge of encephalitis has been effectively curtailed and eradicated from the eastern UP within a span of six to seven years.\n\nWhile the formal declaration of this remarkable achievement is yet to be made, he asserted that the successful containment of encephalitis has emerged as a beacon of hope and a potential model for replication across the nation and beyond.\n\nAddressing a gathering convened to commemorate the foundation stone laying ceremony for the new administrative building dedicated to MBBS students at BRD Medical College to be built at the cost of Rs 60 crore, along with the inauguration of a cutting-edge solar rooftop plant on the medical college premises, the Chief Minister lauded the pivotal role of BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur \"as the epicentre of this triumph against encephalitis, with the health department serving as the linchpin in this endeavour.\"\n\nHighlighting the profound impact of this milestone in saving the lives of innocent children, he said that previously encephalitis claimed 1,200 to 1,500 lives annually. Moreover, the CM underscored the efficient reallocation of manpower and resources, previously dedicated to combating encephalitis, towards delivering high-quality healthcare services to all segments of society.\n\nReflecting on the journey, he remarked, \"From 1977-78 until 2017, the issue of encephalitis was tragically overlooked by successive administrations. However, upon assuming office in 2017, I resolved to confront this crisis head-on and charted out a course for its eradication.\"\n\nUnderlining the multifaceted approach adopted, he highlighted the pivotal role of community engagement, citing the impactful cleanliness campaign conducted among the Kushinagar Musahars. \"This comprehensive initiative encompassed educational endeavours on hygiene practices and the provision of essential resources like soap, underscoring the holistic approach adopted towards disease prevention and public health promotion,\" he pointed out, adding that he even had to face media trial for encouraging people to use soap. He, however, said that during the coronavirus pandemic, people realised the importance of soap and sanitation.\n\nCM Yogi said that cleanliness is the solution to many diseases, stressing that when attention was focused on cleanliness in mission mode, encephalitis was eradicated from the state.\n\nCM Yogi also talked about the struggle of the BRD Medical College in the past, which despite serving as the sole healthcare centre of eastern Uttar Pradesh, struggled with lack of resources and staff, including doctors, paramedics, nursing staff and the manpower required for other tasks.\n\n\"In 1998-99, the Medical Council of India (MCI) once again revoked accreditation to the BRD Medical College. Thereafter, I, along with the then Health Minister, went to Delhi, submitted an affidavit, and pledged to fulfil the necessary requirements,\" Yogi said, underscoring the importance of the medical college for people of eastern Uttar Pradesh.\n\nDiscussing the changes that have taken place in UP after 2017, he said that now a Pediatrics Institute has been started at the medical college. \"The pediatric ward is well-equipped and has undergone infrastructure development. A Regional Medical Research Centre has also become functional on the same campus, and a super-specialty block has been constructed. Initially, there was a shortage of seats, and accreditation was in crisis. However, now the government is providing infrastructure for increased seats\", he informed.\n\nThe Chief Minister stated that the BRD Medical College and AIIMS are maintaining parallel quality standards today, calling for mutual exchange of knowledge between the two institutions.\n\nCM Yogi exhorted doctors and medical students to embrace diligence and fortitude, particularly in the face of escalating workloads and challenging circumstances. Each patient, he noted, arrives with a unique tapestry of personal history, familial background, and socio-economic context. By meticulously understanding and documenting these intricacies, he asserted, one can catalyse revolutionary breakthroughs in the medical realm.\n\nHighlighting the pivotal role of BRD Medical College as a lifeline for patients not only from eastern Uttar Pradesh but also from Bihar and the Terai region of Nepal, the Chief Minister underscored the importance of studying and comprehending the diverse backgrounds of these patients.\n\nEncouraging doctors to embrace innovation and research, he championed Uttar Pradesh's transition towards clean and sustainable energy. He reminisced on the visionary mantra articulated by PM Modi in 2017, which galvanised the state government to install 16 lakh streetlights at zero cost, thus heralding significant strides in energy conservation and emission reduction.\n\nCM Yogi further elaborated on the state's policy of incentivising surplus electricity generated through solar panels, a testament to its commitment to renewable energy. Commending the BRD Medical College for spearheading the installation of rooftop solar plants, he echoed PM Modi's ambitious vision to propel the nation towards a future powered entirely by clean and green energy by 2070.\n\nReflecting on the transformative trajectory of Uttar Pradesh, he heralded the forthcoming Ground Breaking Ceremony on February 19, which marks the initiation of investment projects worth Rs 10 lakh crore, positioning the state as a trailblazer in economic resurgence.\n\nAdditionally, he revealed the forthcoming construction of a ground-plus-five-floor administrative building at the BRD Medical College, costing Rs 60 crore, aimed at accommodating the increased capacity of 50 seats for undergraduate MBBS students. Furthermore, the inauguration of the 1 MW capacity solar rooftop plant, at a cost of Rs 5 crore, signifies a substantial milestone in energy efficiency, expected to yield significant savings of Rs 72 lakh annually in the medical college's electricity expenditure.",

        "title": "Ahlan Modi: An Enchanting Enigma of Bharat - News18",
        "text": "Bharat has embarked on a sojourn to revive its civilisation, culture and character while exuding a deep commitment and pledge towards 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' - a hope and dream that brings the world together as one. Our civilisational reclamation goes beyond the boundaries of Bharat and across oceans as we rekindle our global friendships and attempt to foster a \"One World\" philosophy, in resolve and actions. The pride and innate humility with which our Pradhan Sewak, Narendra Modi carries Bharat to the world, is inspiring and invigorating and promotes a deeper people-to-people connect.\n\nAs Prime Minister Modi attended the inauguration of the BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Abu Dhabi, UAE on February 14, 2024, and recounted the journey from conceptualisation to the inauguration of this mandir, he not only mentioned his spiritual connection with Pramukh Swami Maharaj but also intricately alluded to the positive roleplay of government and people of the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe Swaminarayan Mandir is an apostle of peace and harmony, as it stands proudly in UAE; signifying religious harmony and multiculturalism. While the mandir will provide strength and hope to devotees, it will also act as a harbinger for a deeper connect of Bharat with the Middle East, a gateway to Europe. The significance of the mandir can be construed as a brighter future for Bharat and the world as per the following parameters:\n\nThe Ram Mandir consecration on January 22, 2024, at Ayodhya, has reignited Sanatana Dharma and espoused the people of Bharat to reconnect with their civilisational roots and eternal faith. The inauguration of the Swaminarayan Mandir brings much joy to both the diaspora and the citizens of Bharat, invoking caged passion about our nationhood, our culture and the promotion of peace through Hinduism. The new level of confidence enthused in the people of Bharat is noticeable and the world acknowledges it with admiration.\n\nWhile the positives in geopolitics and the growth of Bharat as 'Vishwaguru' are a given, the inauguration of the Swaminarayan Mandir has subtle ramifications within Bharat as envisaged:\n\nBharat has been able to showcase its deeper commitment towards 'One Earth, One Family, One Future' during the G20 Presidency and summit in 2023 and the world believes in our commitment and shared prosperous future too. The day when one can travel to any part of the world and be oneself and also be able to practice one's faith will be a truism of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' and as visa norms get relaxed with deepened relations, faith will add a positive flavour to bilateralism, regionalism and multilateralism.\n\nWhile the 'Temple Run' is on, we await the Ram Mandir in Perth, Australia, where we have many devotees and many Australians who believe in the 'way of life' showcased by and enshrined in Hinduism. Mandirs will inspire peace, prosperity and harmony in the world and the world believes in that too, as it believes in Team Bharat.",

He was emotional to see a sea of Indians gathered to welcome him and in honour of the host country he gave a slogan- Bharat-UAE Friendship -Zindabad.\n\nIn honour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's address at the World Government Summit, Burj Khalifa in Dubai was lit up with the words 'Guest of Honour - Republic of India. Dubai's Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum extended a warm welcome to PM Modi.\n\nMillions from all over the world watched with glee calling the Hindu Mandir inauguration in Abu Dhabi by Modi as 'unbelievable, incredible and unprecedented '. It was the finest hour for Sanatan Dharm followers to see that with full support from the ruler of the UAE Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan , India's Prime Minister Modi inaugurated one of the grandest Hindu temples in an Islamic Arab country - heralding a new age of the eternal Hindu Vaidik message of Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam .\n\nWhen the global head of the Swaminarayan BAPS Pujya Mahant Swami ji reached UAE to consecrate the Hindu temple, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan the third president of the United Arab Emirates and the ruler of Abu Dhabi, honoured him with these words- \"Welcome to the UAE. Our nation is blessed with your presence. We are touched by your kindness and we feel your prayers.\" Swami ji was given full state honour befitting a Head of the State.\n\nSomething extraordinary is happening with the message of India's Sanatan Dharma world-wide.\n\nSwami Brahmavihari Das , the moving force behind the temple's rise and head of international relations of the BAPS, described the temple as 'spiritual oasis for global harmony'.\n\nThere was a sanatan dharm yagya in Abu Dhabi before the consecration of the Mandir , by the global head of the Swaminarayan BAPS Pujya Mahant Swami ji, who lit the sacred Agni of Yagna with Solar ignited flame.\n\nThat an Arab, Islamic country would give twenty seven acres of land for a Hindu temple still seems to be a miracle- a miracle of the power of devotion, compassion and message of harmony that was symbolised by Pujya Pramukh Swami, the legendary head of the Swaminarayan BAPS and who had dreamt of having this temple in Abu Dhabi. It got full support from the diplomatic soft power under PM Modi and the result is the temple of harmony and peace, rightly called as the Dharma-Lotus bloomed in the Arab desert.\n\nThe inauguration of a Hindu temple in an Arab Islamic country was simply an inconceivable idea till a few years back. It is the magic of Modi era that in Arab lands respect and love for India has increased manifold. We saw how our former naval officers were freed from Qatar and Modi is on an official visit to Qatar too after the Mandir inauguration.\n\nUAE has given its highest award The Order of Zayed to PM Modi before he went to inaugurate the temple\n\nThis visit must serve as an eye opener ( if they really want to see the truth ) for those Indian Muslim leaders and secular segment that thrive on creating false fears among local Muslims against Modi and BJP . Arab Muslims, the original followers of Islam have presented a better, harmonious and peaceful face of their regime for their Hindu friends serving as a beacon of light for entire humanity. Will our hatemongers take a lesson from it?\n\nSo far Swaminarayan BAPS has built more than 1100 temples world wide - a feat that amazes even the bitterest critics of Hindu dharma and it bewilders them that how on the strength of pure heart, transparent spirituality and compassion for all -beyond boundaries, the ochre robed monks - radiant with an indescribable aura of Bhakti of the world's most ancient Vedik faith keep spreading their message of love and peace unhindered.\n\nThe entire work of Abu Dhabi's Hindu Mandir - from its conceptualisation to the realisation, from intricate sculpture work, designing, decisions about the sacred moortis and Hindu motifs, was done by the saffron clad Swaminarayan sadhus , who are young, possess high academic excellence , degrees from the world known universities of Europe and America.\n\nNo doubt that in real sense the world is looking with awe and admiration how a devout Islamic nation facilitated a grand Hindu temple, the biggest in the Arab land and gulf countries and became a symbol of universal brotherhood. Modi's devotion to the cultural and civilisational milieu of a nation that fought the foreign invasion for a millennium has mesmerised the world community and earned him appreciation from millions crossing all ideological and religious boundaries. As far as memory helps, this kind of a global appreciation and admiration hasn't occurred for any Indian leader of any hue in the last one thousand years.\n\nWhat does this Hindu temple signify in a foreign land?\n\nIn one essence it is Sewa.\n\nWhen Delhi's Akshardham was inaugurated by the then President Dr Abdul Kalam, it was considered to be a revolution. Can you imagine a mosque or a church being declared open by a Hindu scholar? But here was a Hindu seer, who chose Abdul Kalam, a Muslim to inaugurate Akshardham because he thought this is not just a temple but a centre of India's rejuvenation and inspiration for the young to build a greater Bharatvarsh.\n\nSwaminarayan sadhus come from very high acedemic background. These qualified technocrats, engineers, doctors are not just trained in the ancient Hindu scriptures, Sanskrit and attain knowledge of religious duties, they are encouraged to use their professional abilities to serve the needy and help the Hindu dharma take up new challenges of a rapidly moving society. Synchronising Dharma with the demands of a global market economy and cyber age becomes their new assignment.\n\nAbu Dhabi's Hindu temple represents the best in humanity and the aspirations of the people to build a happy, peaceful earth.",

        "text": "Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh) [India], February 14 (ANI): Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, on Wednesday, said that the grant under Mukhyamantri Kanya Sumangala Yojana will be increased from Rs 15,000 to Rs 25,000 per beneficiary annually from April, this year. The CM said that as per the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the double-engine government is working diligently for the safety, respect, and dignity of women.\n\nAddressing the Mukhyamantri Samuhik Vivah Samaroh organized on the fertilizer factory premises on the auspicious occasion of Basant Panchami, the CM Yogi said, \"In 2014, PM Modi launched the \"Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao\" campaign to ensure the safety, respect, and self-reliance of women. Only when daughters are protected and educated, can they contribute to the country and society.\"He emphasized that a daughter contributes to the advancement of the entire family, adding that several schemes are being implemented at the central and state levels today to save and empower daughters. On this occasion, he also inaugurated 91 development projects costing Rs 252 crore.\n\nCM Yogi mentioned that after becoming the Chief Minister for the first time in 2017, he launched the Kanya Sumangala Yojana, which facilitates education of a girl child right from her birth till graduation. He said that the government has provided Rs. 15,000 to more than 17 lakh daughters annually through this scheme so far. This amount will be increased to Rs. 25,000 from April.\n\nHe said that under the \"Mukhyamnatri Samuhik Vivah Yojana\", the state government has conducted three lakh marriages since 2017, spending Rs. 51,000 per couple, out of which Rs. 35,000 are sent to the bride's account. \"It's heartening to see that children from both poor and affluent families are participating in the 'Samuhik Vivah Samaroh'\", he stated.\n\nChief Minister Yogi emphasised that marriage, as a timeless tradition, serves as the cornerstone of responsible households, nurturing and perpetuating ancestral legacies through generations. \"It intricately intertwines with the very fabric of the universe, symbolizing the cyclical nature of life itself,\" he said.\n\nAcknowledging the prevalence of distortions in this sacred institution over time, the Chief Minister highlighted the grave injustices perpetrated against women, including abhorrent practices such as child marriages, dowry, divorces and female foeticide. These practices, he lamented, not only undermine the dignity of women but also contravene the principles of humanity and respect.\n\nThe Chief Minister urged people to pledge to not participate in child marriages, not to give or take dowry, and to put an end to practices like divorce forever.\n\nAffirming the government's unwavering commitment to women's welfare, Chief Minister Yogi underscored the pivotal role played by women self-help groups in promoting safety, dignity, and self-reliance among women. He lauded the proactive measures taken to empower women, including the allocation of houses under the PM Awas Yojana and the conferment of land ownership rights through the PM Swamitva Yojana, with a significant focus on enhancing women's participation and ownership.\n\nAs the auspicious occasion of Basant Panchami dawned, heralding the worship of Goddess Saraswati, the embodiment of wisdom and intellect, Chief Minister Yogi invoked her blessings for the successful accomplishment of all endeavors. He extolled the sanctity of the holy festival, celebrating the inexorable march of nature towards its zenith of beauty and vitality.\n\nIn a heartwarming gesture, Chief Minister Yogi extended heartfelt congratulations to the thousand couples embarking on the sacred journey of marital bliss. He wished them a prosperous and harmonious life filled with love and companionship, underscoring the significance of this joyous occasion.\n\nIn a symbolic gesture of support and encouragement, CM Yogi presented certificates and gift-shagun kits to ten newlyweds, symbolizing the government's commitment to fostering love, unity, and social cohesion within the community. As the ceremony unfolded, imbued with the spirit of celebration and camaraderie, the Chief Minister reaffirmed his unwavering resolve to usher in an era of progress, development, and prosperity for all citizens of Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAmidst the jubilant festivities, a palpable sense of optimism and hope permeated the air, as the collective aspirations of a brighter future found expression in the union of a thousand souls, bound by the timeless bonds of love and commitment. MP Ravikishan Shukla also spoke on the occasion. (ANI)",

        "text": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated Abu Dhabis first Hindu temple, hailing it as a testament to the shared heritage of humanity and expressing gratitude to the UAE for promoting religious harmony.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated Abu Dhabi's first Hindu stone temple on Wednesday, describing it as a symbol of the shared heritage of humanity and thanking the UAE for scripting a new golden chapter of human history.\n\nA Symbol of Shared Heritage\n\nSpeaking at the inauguration of the temple built by the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha BAPS, the Prime Minister profusely thanked the President of UAE, Sheikh Mohammad Zayed Al Nahyan, for making the grand temple in Abu Dhabi a reality and said he has not only won the hearts of Indians living in the Gulf nation but also of 140 crore Indians.\n\nA Wave of Happiness\n\nRecalling the consecration ceremony of the newly constructed Ram temple in Ayodhya last month, the Prime Minister said it was his good fortune to have witnessed the inauguration of the BAPS temple in Abu Dhabi.\n\n\"Our immense pleasure in Ayodhya has been further enhanced by the wave of happiness received in Abu Dhabi today. It is my good fortune that I have been a witness to the grand Shri Ram temple first in Ayodhya, and then to this temple in Abu Dhabi,\" he said.\n\nA Grand Temple in Abu Dhabi\n\nThe BAPS temple is built on a 27-acre site in Abu Mreikhah, near Al Rahba off the Dubai-Abu Dhabi Sheikh Zayed Highway, at a cost of around Rs 700 crore.\n\nThe Prime Minister noted that this is not only the time of India's Amrit Kaal, this is also the time of Amrit Kaal of our faith and culture.\n\nA Glimpse of Diverse Faiths\n\n\"We do not see hatred in diversity, we consider diversity as our specialty! In this temple, we will see a glimpse of diverse faiths at each and every step,\" Modi said.\n\nHe said the UAE, which till now was known for Burj Khalifa, Future Museum, Sheikh Zayed Mosque and other hi-tech buildings, has now added another cultural chapter to its identity.\n\nA People-to-People Connect\n\n\"I am confident that a large number of devotees will come here in the times to come. This will also increase the number of people coming to the UAE and increase the people-to-people connect between the two countries,\" Modi said.\n\nLauding the UAE President's Contribution\n\nLauding the contribution of the UAE president in making the grand temple a reality, he said, If there is anyone who has the biggest and the most significant role in making this grand temple a reality, then it is none other than my brother His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed.\n\n\"The Government of UAE has wholeheartedly worked to fulfil the aspirations of crores of Indians. The Government of UAE has not only won the hearts of Indians living in the UAE but also of all 140 crore Indians,\" he said.\n\nA Tour of the Temple\n\nEarlier, Modi, dressed in a light pink silk dhoti and kurta paired with a sleeveless jacket and stole, took a tour of the temple spread across a 27-acre campus and participated in the rituals of a ceremony to dedicate the temple to the people prior to its inauguration.\n\nA Glimpse of Confidence\n\nModi said at every step in this temple one gets a glimpse of this confidence that strengthens belief in humanity.\n\n\"On the walls of the temple, alongside the Hindu religion, you will see hieroglyphs from Egypt. Stories from the Bible and Quran have been carved. At the entrance of the temple you get to see the wall of harmony which has been built by our brothers from the Bohra Muslim community,\" he said.\n\nA Collaborative Effort\n\nThe Prime Minister said the impressive 3D experience in this temple was initiated by members of the Parsi community and the responsibility of the langar was taken up by Sikh brethren.\n\n\"Members of every religion and sect have come forward to build this temple. The seven pillars of this temple represent the seven emirates. This is the nature of the Indian people. Wherever we go, we respect and imbibe their culture and values. This aspect of respect for every faith is also seen in the life of Sheikh Mohammad,\" he said.\n\nA Standing Ovation\n\nThose gathered at the event gave a standing ovation to the UAE President as a mark of appreciation of his contribution to the construction of the temple.\n\nA Wide Range of Programmes\n\nLater, taking to Twitter, Modi said, During this UAE visit, I got to be a part of a wide range of programmes, which have boosted India-UAE friendship and deepened the cultural connect between our nations. I am glad to have addressed the @WorldGovSummit and talked about our efforts to make our planet better. I thank the Government and people of UAE for their warm hospitality.\n\nA Global Aarti\n\nDuring the temple visit, Modi met people from different faiths who contributed to the construction of the first Hindu stone temple here.\n\nThe prime minister also participated in Global Aarti, which was performed simultaneously at over 1,200 temples of the Swaminarayan sect worldwide built by BAPS.\n\nA Tour of the Temple\n\nHe touched the feet of BAPS spiritual leader Mahant Swami Maharaj and took his blessings.\n\nThe prime minister also offered water in the virtual Ganga and Yamuna rivers at the temple before proceeding to inaugurate the temple.\n\nHe also inscribed \"Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam\" on the stone using a hammer and chisel at the temple.\n\nHe offered flowers to idols of all deities in the temple after which he was given a tour of the temple where he saw the architectural details and work done by sculptors at the grand temple.\n\nA Unique Construction\n\nAccording to the temple authorities, the grand temple has been built as per an ancient style of construction and creation mentioned in the Shilpa and Sthapathya Shastras, Hindu scriptures which describe the art for mandir design and construction.\n\nThe architectural methods have been clubbed with scientific techniques here. Over 300 high-tech sensors have been installed at every level of the temple to measure temperature, pressure and movement seismic activity. The sensors will provide live data for research. If there is any earthquake in the region, the temple will detect it, and we will be able to study, Swami Brahmaviharidas, head of international relations for BAPS, told PTI.\n\nSustainable Features\n\nNo metal has been used in the construction of the temple and fly ash has been used to fill up the foundation, replacing 55 per cent of cement in the concrete mix, reducing the carbon footprint of the temple.\n\nMadhusudan Patel, the temples construction manager, told PTI, We have used heat-resistant nano tiles and heavy glass panels, merging both traditional aesthetic stone structures with modern-day functionality.\n\nConsidering the extreme temperatures in the UAE, the tiles will be comfortable for visitors to walk even in hot weather. Non-ferrous material has also been used in the temple.\n\nA Blend of Cultures\n\nConstructed with 18 lakh bricks, seven lakh man hours and 1.8 lakh cubic metres of sandstone sourced directly from Rajasthan - Abu Dhabis first Hindu temple has been made in the Nagara style of architecture, just like the recently inaugurated Ram Temple in Ayodhya.\n\nAccording to Umesh Raja, a volunteer at the temple, 20,000 tonnes of sandstone pieces were carved in Rajasthan and then shipped to Abu Dhabi in 700 containers.\n\nNot just the stone, many labourers who helped construct the temple over five years belong to Gujarat and Rajasthan. Even the marble mined from Italy was first shipped to India for carving and then back to the UAE to be used in the interiors, he said.\n\nA Symbol of Unity\n\nThe work for the structure has been going on since 2019. The land for the temple was donated by the UAE government. The UAE has three other Hindu temples that are located in Dubai. The BAPS temple, spread over a large area with stone architecture, will be the largest of all in the Gulf region.\n\nSeven spires representing seven Emirates of the UAE, carvings of camels, and national bird falcon, are part of the architecture of the temple to give equal representation to the host country.\n\nThe seven shikhars spires represent the seven Emirates of the UAE, Swami Brahmaviharidas, head of international relations for BAPS, told PTI.\n\nThe seven spires have idols of deities, including Lord Ram, Lord Shiv, Lord Jagannath, Lord Krishna, Lord Swaminarayan considered a reincarnation of Lord Krishna, Tirupati Balaji and Lord Ayappa.\n\nThe seven spires pay homage to the seven important deities, underscoring the interconnectedness of cultures and religions. Normally, our temples are either one spire, three, or five, but come here, the seven spires express our gratitude to the unity of the seven emirates. But at the same time, the seven spires enshrine seven important deities, Swami Brahmaviharidas said.\n\nThe spirals aim to promote unity and harmony in the multicultural landscape. Standing at a towering 108 feet, the temple will pave the way for the cultural integration of diverse communities in the region, he said.\n\nA Reflection of the UAE's Landscape\n\nThe camel -- a symbol of persistence, commitment and endurance -- has been etched into the carvings of the temple while drawing inspiration from the landscapes of the UAE, said Som Singh, a stone artisan at the temple.\n\nApart from 15 tales from India, including the Ramayana and Mahabharata, stories from Mayan, Aztec, Egyptian, Arabic, European, Chinese and African civilisations have also been depicted in the temple.\n\nA Blend of Styles\n\nWhile the outer walls of the temple are made using sandstone from India, the interior, made of white Italian marble, is adorned with intricately designed and carved columns and walls.\n\nOther noteworthy architectural elements include two ghumats domes, 12 samrans dome-like structures and 402 pillars. The two ghumats are the Dome of Peace and Dome of Harmony.\n\nThe Dome of Harmony showcases five natural elements -- water, fire, air, earth and space.\n\nA Wall of Harmony, one of the largest 3D-printed walls in the UAE, features a video showcasing key milestones of the temples construction.",

This alteration, which excludes the late Prime Minister and the renowned actress from the National Film Awards, marks one of twelve total modifications implemented.\n\nThe Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has revised the 70th National Film Awards 2022 regulations, resulting in increased cash prizes and category adjustments. These modifications were unanimously agreed upon by the committee formed by the Modi government during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAs per the changes made by the committee headed by the government, the Indira Gandhi Award for Best Debut Film has now been renamed to the Best Debut Film for the Director. The Nargis Dutt Award for Best Feature Film on National Integration will now be called the 'Best Feature Film on Promoting National, Social and Environmental Values', merging the categories of social issues and environment conservation.\n\nThe amendments to the rules for the 70th National Film Awards 2022 encompass various enhancements, such as modifications to several awards and augmented cash prizes for various awards including the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award. The prize money for the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, which is given every year to a film personality for contribution to Indian cinema, has been increased from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 15 lakh. The money for the film award, which was earlier divided between the producer and the director, will now go only to the director.\n\nApart from this, the prize money has been increased to Rs 3 lakh for the Swarna Kamal Award (Golden Lotus Award) and Rs 2 lakh for the Rajat Kamal Award (Silver Lotus Award) Winner in many sections. Earlier, it used to vary according to categories. The awards for 'Best Animation Film' and 'Best Special Effects' have been added to a new category called Best AVGC (Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming and Comics) Film with two sections.\n\nThe 'Best Audiography Section', which had three sections honouring Sound Recordist, Sound Designer and Recordist of Mixed Track, will now be known as Best Sound Design. Its prize money has been increased from Rs 50,000 to Rs 2 lakh. Changes have also been made in the Best Music Direction section, which will now be known as 'Best Background Music'.\n\nA Special Jury Award has been discontinued, but the jury has the authority to confer two awards in the feature film and non-feature film categories of the National Film Awards. In the non-feature film section, some parts have been discontinued while the rest have been merged. A new award category has been started for the best script.\n\nTwo film sections have been created by combining the categories like Best Psychological Film, Best Science and Technology Film, Best Ad Film, Best Environmental Film including Agriculture, Best Film on Social Issues, Best Educational Film, Best Adventure Film and Best Investigative Film. The best feature and best non-feature films promoting social and environmental issues are the new two categories made. Special jury awards in the Best Film as well as the Non-Feature section on family values have been discontinued.\n\nThe committee, headed by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting of the Central Government, was headed by Additional Secretary of the Ministry Neerja Shekhar. It included filmmakers Priyadarshan, Vipul Shah, Haobam Paban Kumar, Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) chief Prasoon Joshi, S Nallamuthu as well as I&B's Prithol Kumar and the ministry's Director (Finance) Kamlesh Kumar Sinha.",

        "text": "Bookmark stories for easy access on any device or the Swarajya app.\n\nOn 10 February, Union Home Minister Amit Shah paid a visit to Mysuru, and met with the state leadership, among other important functionaries, to discuss the strategy for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections in the country.\n\nShah has asked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) unit to deliver all the 28 seats in the state to the BJP -- a first-of-its-kind victory to any party, should it come true.\n\nHis tour also included a visit to Suttur Matha, a prominent Veerashaiva-Lingayat institution that commands influence across the region, since it happens to administer more than 300 educational institutes in the state.\n\nShah's focused meeting with the state leadership, including party chief B Y Vijayendra included taking note of the current development, reviewing the preparation for the general elections in the state, and passing on a message to the JD(S)-BJP cadre on the ground to work in unity, ensure a smooth transfer of votes, and possibly increase the vote share by 10 per cent across all the booths in the constituencies.\n\nIt is important to note that the BJP won 25 out of 28 Lok Sabha seats in the state during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, excluding one seat in Mandya won by independent candidate Sumalatha Ambareesh, who later went on to declare support to the saffron party.\n\nThis result was a historic best for any party, including the Congress, which won 24 seats during the 1984 general elections when Rajiv Gandhi's Congress managed to bag more than 400 seats -- a historic best for the party.\n\nThe BJP lost the previous assembly elections in the state as a sizable Lingayat voters moved to the Congress, and Siddaramaiah's formula of appeasing the AHINDA voters made an impact for the Congress party. Additionally, the minority votes moved away from the Janata Dal (Secular)-JD(S) to the Congress and resulted in making the difference for the party where it was most necessary.\n\nAdding to the BJP woes, the state unit saw infighting between several camps, and did not have a leadership which could unite all the camps and beat the anti-incumbency faced by the then Basavaraj Bommai-led BJP government in the state.\n\nThis time around, experts predict a swing of 15 per cent votes towards the BJP, irrespective of who is in power in the state. Karnataka has traditionally struggled to see a 'double-engine' government in the state, and has voted differently in local elections and the national one.\n\nEven during the analysis of the 2023 performance by the Congress, election observers and psephologists like Yashwant Deshmukh from C-Voter predict an 8-10 per cent lead for the BJP during the general election, and the Modi factor will have an impact which cannot be easily discounted.\n\nThis is what Shah stated in Mysuru too. He emphasised on the party rallying on the Modi factor to increase their performance in the state. There can be an argument made that the BJP may have a slight edge over the Congress this time around too because of three important factors:\n\nOne, despite an alliance between the JD(S) and the Congress, the BJP managed to bag a surprise win across many constituencies in the state last time, and the alliance was reduced to merely two seats (D K Suresh from Bangalore Rural and Prajwal Revanna from Hassan).\n\nTwo, in a fight over 'promises' and 'models', Chief Minister Siddaramaiah's model of offering populist schemes may not work very well in the general elections. On the other hand, 'Modi ka guarantee' has worked wonders for the party even in high anti-incumbency states like Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.\n\nThree, an upset Lingayat community may find its way back to the BJP with Vijayendra's appointment as the party chief, blessed by B S Yediyurappa. With the Vokkaligas and Lingayats jointly voting for the JD(S)-BJP alliance, the Congress may struggle to win anything beyond 0-4 seats. The BJP has a stable team now, relatively speaking, and has tried uniting all the camps.\n\nMoreover, the BJP appointed fresh faces as office bearers this time around, and they come from a wide variety of backgrounds. Swarajya reported this earlier.\n\nOther factors include the BJP's plan to field new faces in constituencies where they are sure of winning, or have a room for experimentation. This includes Dakshina Kannada, Uttara Kannada, Bengaluru Rural, Bengaluru North, to name a few. Some old horses like Ananth Kumar Hegde, Nalin Kumar Kateel may be retired or offered a different avenue.\n\nTop sources in the BJP tell Swarajya that the party is considering new candidates across 8-10 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state, but declined to name them. This is one of their strategy to beat anti-incumbency. JD(S) may be offered up to four seats on a seat-sharing basis.\n\nMeanwhile, the Congress seems to be confident of winning 3-4 seats, while they publicly say they can win up to ten. This includes Bidar, Gulbarga, Bangalore Rural and Belagavi.\n\nWith former chief minister Jagadish Shettar returning to the BJP, there are rumours that he may be offered to contest from Belagavi, among other seats which are under consideration. Read this piece for more context.\n\nAbout the ten-odd seats the BJP is struggling with -- they mainly have to do with the candidates themselves declaring their intention to not run for polls citing age and other factors.\n\nSo, in seats like Haveri, Chamarajanagara, Bengaluru North, Tumakuru, Dakshina Kannada, Davanagere, and Chitradurga, the party seems to be scouting for options in new candidates who may have a winnability factor with them.\n\nThe party also seems to be in the mood to groom a set of new leaders in their 30s and 40s who can offer stable leadership for the next decade or two.\n\n\"These issues are going to be addressed, and the party will consider everyone's point-of-view. This time, we are determined to win all the 28 seats because it is also Prime Minister Modi's election,\" an insider tells Swarajya.\n\n\"Even if new candidates are chosen (in 5-6 constituencies), they may not be announced till the last moment. We want the Congress to declare their candidates first and then take a call on ours. That way, we can put up the best candidate in each and every constituency where there is a tough fight,\" he adds.\n\nAll in all, nearly 10-12 Lok Sabha seats will be interesting to watch out for. This also includes Udupi, Chikkaballapura, Kolara, Bangalore North and Rural.\n\nProf Sandeep Shastri, a psephologist, who is currently serving as Vice Chancellor of Jagran Lakecity University, tells Swarajya that it will be a tough race. He says that the BJP has recovered ground as compared to the Assembly elections.\n\n\"The Congress would be relying on its guarantees and public perception of the same. It is important to underscore that Karnataka has voted differently in Lok Sabha and Assembly contests. The Modi factor and its impact will be key. Can the Congress maintain its unity and fight the election as one force, will be decisive. It seems a bit of an advantage to BJP at the moment but things can change,\" he says.",

        "text": "The premier's speech at \"Ahlan Modi\" (Welcome Modi), an event at Zayed Sports City Stadium in Abu Dhabi that brought together about 60,000 people, was peppered with praise for UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan for taking care of the 3.5-million expatriate community and strengthening bilateral ties.\n\nSuch community events have become a feature of Modi's foreign visits and he used the occasion to focus on the strong strategic partnership between India and the UAE and the Indian community's role in bringing the two sides closer and boosting the development of the emirates.\n\n\"India and the UAE are together scripting a new history for the 21st century and you are part of the strong base for this history along with me. Your hard work here is giving India energy. You should keep making the progress and friendship of India and the UAE stronger,\" Modi told the gathering comprising mostly Indian nationals, speaking in Hindi.\n\nHe also spoke some lines in Arabic, Malayalam, Kannada, Tamil and Telugu during the course of his address.\n\nIndia and the UAE are partners in each other's progress, and relations were strengthened by joint work in talent, innovation and culture. The UAE is India's third largest trade partner and seventh largest investor, and both sides are closely cooperating to improve the ease of living and ease of doing business, he said.\n\nAgreements signed by the two countries on Tuesday will integrate their financial systems and strengthen the technology and innovation partnership. India shared its RuPay card stack to help develop the UAE's domestic card system named Jaywan, and India's Unified Payment Interface (UPI) will start functioning soon in the emirates, facilitating seamless payments between accounts in both countries. \"You can easily send money to your family members in India,\" Modi said.\n\nModi repeatedly referred to the UAE president as \"my brother Mohamed bin Zayed\" and recalled how the ruler had personally welcomed him on his first visit to the emirates in 2015 and again this week. Noting that this was seventh visit to the UAE in about a decade, he said: \"I am happy that we too could welcome [Mohamed bin Zayed] four times in India. When he recently visited Gujarat, hundreds of thousands of people gathered on the roads to welcome him.\"\n\nHe expressed his gratitude to Mohamed bin Zayed for looking after the Indian expatriate community in UAE and protecting their interests. \"Whenever brother Mohamed bin Zayed meets me, he always praises all Indians and your role in the development of the UAE,\" he said.\n\n\"The leaders of the emirates have given Indians a place in their hearts in happiness and sadness, and this has helped make the relationship stronger,\" Modi said, recalling Mohamed bin Zayed's role in arranging treatment and vaccines for Indians during the Covid-19 pandemics.\n\nIn this context, Modi said he could feel Mohamed bin Zayed's love for Indians when he immediately agreed to the Indian leader's proposal in 2015 to build a Hindu temple in Abu Dhabi. \"He said I will give the land you seek and now the historic time has come for the inauguration of the temple in Abu Dhabi,\" he said, referring to the scheduled opening of BAPS Mandir on Wednesday.\n\nModi spoke a few lines in Arabic to highlight common words used by the people of both countries, which had come to India from the Gulf and reflected ties dating back thousands of years. He said initiatives such as the launch of the master's course at the IIT-Delhi campus in the UAE and the planned opening of a CBSE office in Dubai will ensure the Indian community gets the best education.\n\nAt the same time, Modi highlighted the achievements of his government and plans to make India a developed country by 2047. The economy is growing fast and India leads the world in smartphone data consumption, global fintech adoption rate and milk production, while it is number two in terms of internet users and mobile manufacturing, and number three in the size of its startup ecosystem. An Indian spacecraft reached the moon and the country has had one of the fastest roll-outs of 5G technology, he said.\n\n\"In 10 years, India has gone from being the 11th largest economy to the fifth largest economy. I have faith in the abilities of all Indians, and Modi's guarantee is that my third term make India the third largest economy. Modi's guarantee is that the guarantee will be fulfilled,\" he said.\n\nIndia is building advanced expressways, new airports and railway stations, and the country is recognised for its innovations and mega infrastructure projects, while its digital revolution is praised around the world, he said.\n\n\"India's increasing capabilities have given hope to the world for stability and progress. The world feels India can play a responsible role in creating a trustworthy global order. I am happy that India and the UAE are together making the world's trust stronger,\" Modi said.\n\nIndia had invited the UAE as a partner when it successfully organised the G20 Summit, and the world now sees India as a \"vishwa bandhu\" (friend of the word) whose voice is heard on every big global platform. The government is working round the clock for Indians employed around the world and has also acted quickly to evacuate thousands of Indians facing problems in countries such as Ukraine, Yemen and Sudan, he said.",

The prime minister said UAE is now India's third largest trade partner and seventh largest investor.\n\n\"Both countries are collaborating on ease of living and ease of doing business,\" he added.\n\n\"Today's every single Indian's aim is to make India a developed nation by 2047.

        "title": "Driving economic growth: Dynamic collaboration between India and UAE in Logistics",
        "text": "The collaboration between India and the UAE in the logistics sector received a significant boost with the implementation of the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) on May 1, 2022. This landmark agreement, which eliminates or reduces tariffs on various goods, has unleashed a multitude of trade opportunities, laying the groundwork for bilateral trade to potentially soar to US$ 100 billion within the next five years.\n\nFollowing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the UAE, the UAE-India Business Council (UIBC), Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), and Invest India joined forces to release an extensive report on 'India-UAE collaboration in the logistics sector'. This comprehensive report delves into critical aspects such as the UAE-India CEPA Agreement, India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), India-Middle East Food Corridor, India-UAE Logistics Prospects, among others, providing an in-depth analysis of the synergies, opportunities, and prospects arising from the strategic partnerships between India and the UAE.\n\nThe anticipated surge in trade volume is poised to drive significant growth in India's logistics sector. The escalating demand for transportation and warehousing services will fuel industry expansion, fostering an environment ripe for innovation and entrepreneurial ventures.\n\nThe IMEC, an ambitious 7,200-km-long multi-modal corridor, envisions a seamless linkage between India and Europe via the Arabian Peninsula. This monumental infrastructure project is poised to revolutionize trade and logistics in India, promising reduced transit times and transportation costs. Furthermore, the transformative impact of the IMEC extends beyond mere cost efficiencies; it is anticipated to enhance trade facilitation, deepen economic integration, and fortify the resilience of regional supply chains.\n\nSimilarly, the India-Middle East Food Corridor underscores the paramount importance of food security. By leveraging innovative logistics solutions such as cold chain management and real-time monitoring, stakeholders can significantly contribute to enhancing the efficiency of the supply chain.\n\nThe convergence of CEPA and IMEC presents an unprecedented opportunity for India's logistics industry to redefine its role in shaping the future of trade. By embracing technological advancements, optimizing supply chains, and prioritizing sustainability, logistics companies in India can play a pivotal role in driving economic growth, fostering regional integration, and transforming the logistics landscape in the country.\n\nMoreover, the recent emphasis on promoting renewable energy in the logistics sector, as evidenced by initiatives such as the G20 New Delhi Summit and COP28 in Dubai, underscores the recognition by India and the UAE of the need to develop an efficient and integrated logistics network to capitalize on their respective strengths. As the global landscape continues to evolve, the strategic alignment between India and the UAE in logistics emerges as a model for harnessing the full potential of bilateral relationships.\n\n\"The Government of India has implemented innovative policies to revolutionize logistics services within the country. The National Logistics Policy aims to improve logistics hubs and aims to reduce the cost of logistics operations in the country to be comparable to global benchmarks by 2030. The policy aims to achieve this by encouraging the use of digital technologies to improve the visibility, traceability, and transparency of goods in transportation, resulting in shorter transit times and lower costs,\" states Invest India.\n\nIndia is UAE's second-largest trading partner, accounting for 9 percent of the total trade. Similarly, the UAE is India's third-largest trading partner after the USA and China. The signing of CEPA in 2022 has led to an increase in bilateral trade from US$ 72.9 billion (April 2021- March 2022) to US$ 84.5 billion (April 2022- March 2023), registering a year-on-year increase of 16 percent. The expansion in trade underscores the urgent need for advanced logistics solutions. For instance, the remarkable 17 percent growth in exports of plain gold jewellery in the fiscal year 2022-23 is a testament to the burgeoning market rapport between India and the UAE. However, the high cost of logistics, dominated by a few key players, poses a challenge. This scenario sets the stage for tech-driven logistics firms to enter the fray, offering disruptive, cost-effective solutions for moving precious goods. The introduction of advanced tracking, automation, and data analytics can revolutionize the logistics landscape, ensuring the secure, efficient movement of goods while reducing costs and fostering greater economic integration under the CEPA framework.",

He also expressed deep appreciation for the rulers and leaders of the UAE and the friendship between India's Prime Minister and the UAE rulers.\n\n\"Well, symbolism is clear and I don't hide it. For a ruler, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, to have space in his heart, to allow the first traditional stone temple in this part of the region, in the history of humanity, I think all of us need to join our hands and applaud the rulers and the leaders of this nation,\" he said addressing a presser in Abu Dhabi.\n\nThis friendship, rooted in trust, transparency, and truth, has been instrumental in bringing this architectural marvel to life, he added.\n\n\"So, the BAPS Hindu Mandir has been built because of the generosity of the rulers. And I also say because of the friendship that our honourable Prime Minister has been able to generate with the rulers, the leaders, through the trade, through the great events that have happened. It's because of trust, transparency, and truth that this entire Mandir has been made,\" he said.\n\nSadhu Brahmaviharidas also unveiled the rich symbolism embedded in temple's design. Adorned with seven spires, the Mandir symbolises gratitude towards the unity of the seven emirates, reflecting the harmonious relationship between India and the UAE. The seven spires also pay homage to seven important deities, underscoring the interconnectedness of cultures and religions.\n\n\"Normally our temples are either one spire, three, or five, but come here, the seven spires express our gratitude to the unity of the seven emirates. But at the same time, the seven spires enshrine seven important deities,\" he said.\n\nBeyond being a place of worship, the BAPS Hindu Mandir in Abu Dhabi is positioned as a hub of values and cultural celebration. The integration of ancient civilisations from across the world distinguishes it as a symbol of global unity and understanding, he said.\n\n\"So the temple is not just a place of worship, it's a place of values. And I think all of you have appreciated that this is perhaps the only place of worship that has included ancient civilisations,\" Sadhu Brahmaviharidas said.\n\nThe incorporation of advanced technology, including 300 sensors, elevates the temple to the status of a scientific marvel.\n\n\"We have placed 300 sensors at almost every level of the temple. This is the first traditional stone temple that has scientific sensors, load sensors that measure pressure, temperature, movement. If there's an earthquake anywhere in this region, the temple will detect it, and we will be able to study the mechanics of the whole monument,\" he added.\n\nEven before its official inauguration, the Mandir has already become a symbol of global unity. Over 60,000 people from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and nations have actively contributed to its construction. Recently, ambassadors from 40 nations gathered to celebrate the temple, emphasizing its role as a unifying force on the global stage, the leader of international relations for the BAPS Swaminarayan Sanstha said.\n\nThe BAPS Hindu Mandir in Abu Dhabi is poised for its official inauguration by PM Modi on February 14.\n\nPM Modi will be in the UAE on a two-day official visit beginning tomorrow. This will be his seventh visit to the UAE since 2015 and the third in the last eight months.\n\nDuring the visit, PM Modi will hold bilateral meetings with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. The two leaders will discuss ways to further deepen, expand and strengthen the strategic partnership between the countries and exchange views on regional and international issues of mutual interest.\n\nThe Prime Minister will also participate in the World Government Summit 2024 to be held in Dubai as a Guest of Honour and deliver a special keynote address.

It stresses on the need to take care of, and consider, everyone's health in India - especially vulnerable communities - the LGBTQ population, indigenous people, India's different tribes, ethnic and linguistic minorities, people with disabilities, migrants, geographically remote populations, gender and sexual minorities. In a world post COVID-19 pandemic, the need for WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) is reaffirmed as handwashing is one of the ways to prevent Coronavirus infection and other diseases. The campaign will continue to raise awareness on the same along with focussing on the importance of nutrition and healthcare for women and children, fight malnutrition, mental well-being, self-care, science and health, adolescent health & gender awareness. Along with the health of people, the campaign has realised the need to also take care of the health of the eco-system. Our environment is fragile due to human activity, which is not only over-exploiting available resources, but also generating immense pollution as a result of using and extracting those resources. The imbalance has also led to immense biodiversity loss that has caused one of the biggest threats to human survival - climate change. It has now been described as a \"code red for humanity.\" The campaign will continue to cover issues like air pollution, waste management, plastic ban, manual scavenging and sanitation workers and menstrual hygiene. Banega Swasth India will also be taking forward the dream of Swasth Bharat, the campaign feels that only a Swachh or clean India where toilets are used and open defecation free (ODF) status achieved as part of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014, can eradicate diseases like diahorrea and the country can become a Swasth or healthy India.",

        "text": "New Delhi [India], February 12 (ANI): International affairs experts have hailed Indian diplomacy after its major triumph helped secure the release of eight Indian Navy veterans who were detained by Qatar on espionage charges.\n\nFormer diplomat Anil Trigunayat said the release of Indian Navy veterans was made possible by continued diplomacy, tremendous goodwill between the two nations as well as due to the friendship between Emir of Qatar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"Well, it is a matter of great satisfaction that due process was followed and great regard for the bilateral relationship, which is really a great partnership, in terms of energy security, diaspora security between India and Qatar. I am very happy that all these have prevailed and the Indian Navy personnel have returned home,\" Trigunayat said in a video message.\n\n\"Apart from the continued pursuit of diplomacy, the legal process, the tremendous goodwill between the two countries, and above all, the great friendship between the Emir of Qatar, and Prime Minister Modi,\" he added.\n\nHe further said that this development came at a time when the India-Qatar relationship is on a new trajectory with new agreements and opportunities being explored.\n\n\"India has always respected the law of the land and will continue to do so. Qatar has also appreciated the strength and potential of our present-day opportunity, diplomacy, goodwill, and larger canvas. This decision, again comes at a time, when the relationship is on a new trajectory. New agreements are being signed, new opportunities are being explored between the two countries and also India-GCC context,\" the former diplomat added.\n\nForeign Affairs expert, Michael Kugelman also heaped praises on the release of Indian personnel and said that it a \"major diplomatic feat.\"\"A remarkable development that the 8 Indian ex-naval officers on death row in Qatar, reportedly for spying for Israel, have now been released and all but 1 are back in India. That's a major diplomatic feat to get that result for your citizens held abroad on such serious charges,\" Kugelman posted on X.\n\nEarlier, the navy veterans after setting foot in their homeland after months of captivity, heaped praises on PM Modi, saying they wouldn't have been freed had it for the sustained diplomatic efforts at his behest to secure their release.\n\nThe Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) announced early Monday morning the release of the Indian nationals who were detained in Qatar.\n\n\"The Government of India welcomes the release of eight Indian nationals working for the Dahra Global company who were detained in Qatar. Seven out of the eight of them have returned to India. We appreciate the decision by the Amir of the State of Qatar to enable the release and homecoming of these nationals,\" MEA said in a statement.\n\nThe men -- Captain Navtej Singh Gill, Captain Saurabh Vasisht, Commander Purnendu Tiwari, Captain Birendra Kumar Verma, Commander Sugunakar Pakala, Commander Sanjeev Gupta, Commander Amit Nagpal and Sailor Ragesh -- were detained in August 2022.\n\nAmid desperate pleas by the anxious kin of the Navy veterans to secure their release and safe passage back to their homeland, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had assured that it would mobilise all diplomatic channels and arrange legal assistance to bring them back.\n\nOn December 28, 2023, Qatar's Court of Appeal commuted the death penalty awarded to all eight men in October 2023.\n\nThe eight Indian nationals were imprisoned in Qatar since October 2022 and were accused of allegedly spying on a submarine programme. The retired naval personnel were sentenced to death by a Qatar court on charges that have not yet been made public officially.\n\nEarlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Qatar's Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani on the sidelines of the COP28 summit in Dubai and discussed bilateral partnership and the \"well-being of the Indian community\" living in Qatar.

        "title": "Nitish Kumar May Have Won Trust Vote, but Tejashwi Yadav Emerges as Real Winner",
        "text": "Patna: Two weeks after returning to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fold, the Nitish Kumar-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government won the trust vote by 129:0 amidst the walkout from the Opposition in the Bihar Assembly on Monday.\n\nEarlier, the NDA's no-confidence motion against Speaker Awadh Bihari Choudhary (Rashtriya Janata Dal) was won by 125: 112 votes, indicating amply that the ruling alliance had the numerical equations in its favour. The actual strength of the BJP-Janata Dal (United) and Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular (HAMS) stands at 128 against 114 of the Mahagadhbandhan comprising the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress and the Left.\n\nThree RJD MLAs, including Chetan Anand and Neelam Devi, son and wife of the 'gangsters turned politicians', Anand Mohan and Anant Singh respectively crossed the floor to support the ruling alliance. It was understandable in the light of the fact that Nitish, of course with the support of the RJD (in the government then), had changed the jail manual for the early release of Anand Mohan, a life convict in the IAS officer G. Krishnaiah murder case last year. Anant Singh stands convicted in multiple murder cases and is barred from contesting the polls. Neelam had contested the Mokama seat on behalf of her husband and won it in 2020 polls. Observers said that it was hard for the MLAs on the \"wrong side\" of the law to \"antagonise\" the party in power.\n\nMoreover, policemen in huge numbers patrolled around the house of the former deputy chief minister, Tejashwi Yadav who was with his party MLAs at about 2 am, apparently to fuel fear among such MLAs. There were signs of fissures in the JDU too and Jitan Ram Manjhi (HAMS) with four MLAs had openly expressed his dissatisfaction against \"poor portfolio allocation\" to his MLA. The media was agog with the speculations of some JDU MLAs \"snapping\" contact with Nitish Kumar.\n\nEven if these speculations were true, the RJD, Congress and Left were too poor to match the BJP in terms of \"resources\" required in a power game. Armed with power at the Centre, financial muscle, overall control over the prosecuting agencies and penchant to selectively target the opponents, the BJP was better equipped to operate against the Opposition in the state.\n\nTejashwi Yadav\n\nNitish Kumar-led NDA might have won the trust vote but Tejashwi Yadav has, apparently, won the heart. He sounded bitter when Nitish had dumped him, first time, in 2017. He used pungent words against Nitish then. His Monday speech was in sharp contrast to that of 2017. With a smile on his face, Tejashwi began his speech by saying, \"Aap (Nitish) meray aadarniya thay, aadarniyan hain or aur aadarniya rahengen (I respected you, respect you and will keep on respecting you).\"\n\n\"You dubbed me 'beta (son)'. I honored you as an elder of the larger 'Samajvadi parivar' and was obedient to you. But you have acted like king Dasratha who exiled his son Ram to the jungle under Kaikeyi's pressure. I take it as an opportunity to go among the people and struggle for their rights. I will continue my battle against the dictatorial and anti-democratic forces the way my father (Lalu Prasad Yadav) did,\" Tejashwi said; gravity was writ large on his face.\n\nHe recalled that Nitish had laughed by saying \"paisa kahan se laayega (where will he get money from)\", when he (Tejashwi) promised 10 lakh jobs to the youths in the 2020 assembly. \"However, when you joined the Mahagathbandhan you began fulfilling my promise. I am happy that our Mahagathbandhan gave over four lakh jobs during a short-period of time -- an unprecedented feat in the annals of India. The education department which was under the RJD's quota alone handed out over two lakh jobs,\" Tejashwi said, adding, \"Now you are accusing us of taking credit. Why shouldn't we take credit for the work we have done,\" he asked.\n\nTejashwi reminded how Nitish had come back to the RJD, alleging openly that the BJP was all out to split his JDU. \"You repeatedly alleged that they (BJP) had captured the media and the journalists were not publishing what you were saying. You repeatedly said that you would prefer to die than go back to the BJP...I don't want to repeat all these for they are too hackneyed now.\"\n\nUnimpressive Nitish\n\nAgainst Tejashwi's composure, Nitish looked bitter when he stood up to speak. He got angry when some opposition members tried to interrupt. The alacrity and flow he was once known for was missing. \"What was there in Bihar when I came to power in 2005? There were no roads, no electricity, no schools, no hospitals. The people feared coming out on the streets during the rule of your father (Lalu) and mother (Rabri Devi),\" he said.\n\nEven the BJP members were seen smiling when Nitish said, \"Barring a brief interregnum when I handed over the CM's post to Jitan Ram Manjhi, I have been the CM for 18 years. I have stayed with the BJP for a large part of my stint as the CM and have carried out all-round development of the state. Now, I have come back to my old house. I won't go anywhere from here now.\"\n\nHe was downright wrong when he said that the 15 years of the Lalu-Rabri regime were infamous for riots between Hindus and Muslims and he ensured justice for the minorities when he came to power in 2005. Lalu Yadav had come to power in 1990 in the background of one of the worst-ever communal riots in Bhagalpur in 1989.\n\nIf anything Lalu's rule is remembered for, it is for restoring the communal amity in Bihar. The only exception was the riot of Sitamarhi in the 1990s. Lalu had camped at Sitamarhi for seven days, moving out among the people to restore peace and carry out relief operations on a large scale which the then Prime Minister, Chandra Shekhar had praised in glowing terms.\n\nOf course, Nitish initiated many measures to improve the condition of the minorities when he came to power in 2005 in the era of Atal Bihari Vajpayee; the BJP itself then was not as atrocious to the minorities as it is to Narendra Modi pursuing the radical Hindutva.\n\nNeedless to say, Nitish won't be able to protect minorities in the manner in which he did with Vajpayee at the helm of affairs.\n\nThe new deputy to Nitish, Vijay Sinha heaped the charges of corruption on Lalu and his family and indicated that the investigating agencies would go hard on them. Nitish, who used to say that the investigating agencies were after the Lalu family because he had joined the Mahagathbandhan, sounded in tune with Sinha on Monday. \"They were making money when they were in power with me. I will get the charges of corruption investigated now.\"",

As per the data of Trendlyne, Triveni Turbine is a company with zero debt burden, but the more exciting news is that the firm has announced an interim dividend and a special dividend for FY24 for its eligible shareholders.\n\nTriveni Turbine Dividend\n\nThe Board of Directors has \"Declared an Interim Dividend of Rs.1.30/- per fully paid-up equity share of the face value of Re.1/- each and a Special Dividend of Re.1/- per fully paid-up equity share of the face value of Re. 1/- each for the financial year 2023-24, and fixed Friday, February 16, 2024 as the Record Date for purpose of ascertaining the entitlement of Members/Beneficial Owners to the said Interim and Special Dividends.

Its EBITDA for the December 2023 quarter was Rs 83.7 crore, which was 31.4% more than what it was for the same time in the previous fiscal year, which was Rs 63.7 crore. EBITDA margins in Q3 FY 24 climbed to 23.4% from 23% in Q3FY23, a rise of about 35 basis points. In comparison to the same quarter last year, when the company's sales were Rs 325.8 crore, it increased by 32.5% to Rs 431.7 crore in Q3FY24.\n\nMr. Dhruv M. Sawhney, Chairman and Managing Director, Triveni Turbine Limited, said \"Triveni Turbines continues on a robust growth path as demonstrated in stellar results during the nine-month period ending December 31, 2023. New benchmarks have been surpassed in key metrics of revenues, profitability and order booking. Revenues in 9M FY 24 grew 36% over the previous year to reach record level of Rs 11.96 billion. Profit Before Tax (PBT) grew faster at 41% y-o-y and stood at Rs 2.57 billion with higher than expected margins of 21.5%. Earnings per share grew an impressive 43% to Rs 6.08 at the nine-month mark. Order booking during 9M FY 24 grew 27% to Rs 14.43 billion, with export contribution increasing to 53% as against 42% in the previous corresponding period. Robust growth in order booking along with an improved export contribution provides good visibility for both revenues and profitability for the next year.\"\n\n\"With customer-centricity at the core of everything that we do, it has been our endeavour in recent years to expand not only our geographical presence but widen our offerings both in terms of product and aftermarket solutions. We also continue to strategically allocate investments for sustained growth and maintaining a competitive edge. The results of these efforts are well demonstrated in our performance with exports at 46% of sales in 9M FY 24 (vs. 42% in 9M FY 23) and aftermarket as % of sales at 33% in 9M FY 24 (vs. 30% in 9M FY 23),\" he added.\n\n\"In the last 12-18 months, we have witnessed growth in both turnover and profitability in foreign subsidiaries. The Company has also benefited in the form of increased brand awareness, enhanced reputation, international references, to name a few. Gaining confidence from our experience in the African market, we have made further strides in the quarter gone by in pursuit of enhancing the customer value proposition globally through greater local presence. To further our ambitions in the North American market, we commenced the process of investing for a local facility under a wholly owned Subsidiary in the United States (US). We believe this market stands as an attractive opportunity driven by demand for reliable energy solutions, shift towards cleaner energy alternative, coupled with Government initiatives and incentives which make it a compelling space for strategic investments,\" he stated.\n\n\"During Q3 FY 24, we continued to witness healthy demand for products both in domestic and international markets. As a result, order booking for product segment in Q3 FY 24 increased by 23% y-o-y to Rs 3.77 billion. At the nine-month mark, product order booking stands to Rs 9.90 billion, up 19% y-o-y driven by exports especially in the API segment coupled with robust domestic demand. With a 14% increase in overall enquiry book, we remain constructive on future orders for this segment in the medium-term,\" Mr. Dhruv M. Sawhney said.\n\n\"Our aftermarket business continues to go from strength to strength with commendable performance across its sub-segments of spares, services and refurbishing. Under refurbishing we continue to execute orders and generate enquiries across a wider range of rotating equipment beyond industrial steam turbines. The business performance was healthy in Q3 FY 24 and 9M FY 24 with order booking in this segment increasing 34% y-o-y to Rs 1.54 billion and 49% y-o-y to Rs 4.53 billion. Growth was driven by international orders though domestic demand is also healthy with focus on efficiency upgrade and automation,\" the chairman and managing director further added.\n\n\"We remain confident that TTL's robust foundation, operational efficiencies, research and development proficiency, strong manufacturing capabilities and established partnerships position us for significant strides in the Company's growth and enhanced value creation for our stakeholders. While we remain vigilant about external developments, we are assured of our capacity to adeptly navigate challenges, as demonstrated in recent years,\" he commented.\n\nTriveni Turbine Share Price Target\n\nTriveni Turbine is bullish but also overbought on the Daily charts with next resistance at 543. Investors should book profits at current levels as a Daily close below support of 435 could lead to a target of 350 in the near term, said AR Ramachandran from Tips2trades.\n\nComments\n\nMORE TRIVENI TURBINE NEWS\n\nTriveni Turbine Q3 Profit Soars 30% to Rs 68.30 Crore Prabhudas Lilladher Top Pick Is This Multibagger Mid Cap Engineering Stock, Buy This Multibagger Small Cap Stock Gained 9% In Intraday, Brokerage Suggests Buy, Target Price Rs 285 Rs 100/Share Dividend: Rs 36,500 Apparels Stock To Turn Ex-Dividend This Week; BUY, SELL, OR HOLD?

However, it seems that by giving Bharat Ratnas in haste by breaking the rule of giving a maximum of three Bharat Ratnas in a year, this honour has been made election oriented and politicised, and the dignity of the honour has been reduced. I do not think that the NDA will get much benefit from these decisions,\" Gehlot said on X.\n\nOn Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that former prime ministers PV Narasimha Rao and Chaudhary Charan Singh, and agricultural scientist MS Swaminathan will be awarded the Bharat Ratna. Earlier the government had named Karpoori Thakur, socialist leader and former Bihar chief minister and senior BJP leader L K Advani for the highest civilian honour.\n\nThis year's five recipients surpass the four awarded in 1999, marking the highest number of Bharat Ratnas awarded in a single year.\n\nGehlot said, If the NDA government really wants to honor their contribution, then they should conduct a caste census to further the efforts made by Karpoori Thakur for the upliftment of the backward classes; and enact a law for minimum support price as demanded by Chaudhary Charan Singh and MS Swaminathan; and ensure compliance with the Places of Worship Act made by PV Narasimha Rao, which is being disregarded everyday these days; and try to normalize the atmosphere of apprehension like undeclared emergency expressed by Lal Krishna Advani during the NDA government. Otherwise, everyone will believe that these honours are only for electoral gains.\"\n\nCommenting on it, BJP spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said the Congress looks for politics in every work of the BJP.

Reflecting on his participation in last year's inauguration of the festival, he remarked, \"When the contributions of such a great soul are so exceptional, it is natural for the festivities associated with them to be extensive.\"\n\n\"I am confident that this event will serve as an effective medium to acquaint our new generation with the life of Maharshi Dayananda,\" added Prime Minister Modi, emphasizing the importance of passing down the legacy of such remarkable personalities.\n\nPrime Minister Modi, noted that Swami Dayanand was born in Gujarat and was active in Haryana. The Prime Minister highlighted his connection with both regions and acknowledged the profound influence of Swami Dayananda on his life, stating, \"his teachings have shaped my perspective, and his legacy remains an integral part of my journey.\" He extended his greetings to millions of followers both in India and abroad on the occasion of Swami Ji's birth anniversary.\n\nReflecting on the transformative impact of Swami Dayananda's teachings, Prime Minister Modi remarked, \"There are moments in history that alter the course of the future. Two hundred years ago, Swami Dayananda's birth was one such unprecedented moment.\" He highlighted Swami Ji's role in awakening India from the shackles of ignorance and superstition, leading a movement to rediscover the essence of Vedic knowledge. \"In times when our traditions and spirituality were fading, Swami Dayananda called upon us to 'Back to Vedas',\" noted the Prime Minister, underscoring Swami Ji's efforts to provide scholarly commentaries on the Vedas and rational interpretations. He emphasized Swami Ji's fearless critique of societal norms and his elucidation of the true essence of Indian philosophy, which reignited self-confidence within society. The Prime Minister reiterated the significance of Swami Dayananda's teachings in fostering unity and instilling a sense of pride in India's ancient heritage.\n\nPM Modi said, \"Our social evils were used as a means by the British government to portray us as inferior. Some justified British rule by referencing social changes. Swami Dayananda's advent dealt a severe blow to these conspiracies.\" The Prime Minister emphasized, \"A series of revolutionaries such as Lala Lajpat Rai, Ram Prasad Bismil, and Swami Shraddhanand emerged, influenced by Arya Samaj. Therefore, Dayananda Ji was not just a Vedic sage but also a national sage.\"\n\nThe Prime Minister noted that the 200th anniversary has come in the initial years of the Amrit Kaal. Prime Minister Modi, recalled the vision of Swami Dayananda of a bright future for the nation. \"The faith that Swamiji had about India, we will have to convert that faith into our self-confidence in Amrit Kaal. Swami Dayanand was an advocate and guide of modernity\", the Prime Minister added.\n\nAcknowledging the extensive network of Arya Samaj institutions across the globe, Prime Minister Modi stated, \"With over 2,500 schools, colleges, and universities, and more than 400 gurukuls educating students, Arya Samaj is a vibrant testament to modernity and guidance.\" He urged the community to take up the responsibility of nation-building initiatives with renewed vigor in the 21st century. Calling DAV institutions 'a living memory of Swamiji', the Prime Minister assured their continued empowerment.\n\nThe Prime Minister mentioned National Education Policy taking the vision of Swamiji forward. He asked the students and institutions of Arya Samaj to contribute to Vocal for Local, Aatmanirbhar Bharat, Mission Life, water conservation, Swacch Bharat, Sports, and fitness. He also emphasized first-time voters to understand their responsibilities.\n\nReferring to the upcoming 150th anniversary of the founding of Arya Samaj, Prime Minister Modi encouraged everyone to seize this momentous occasion as an opportunity for collective progress and remembrance.\n\nAddressing the importance of natural farming, the Prime Minister highlighted the efforts of Acharya Devvrat Ji and said, \"From Swami Dayananda Ji's birthplace, let the message of organic farming reach every farmer in the nation.\"\n\nPraising Swami Dayananda's advocacy for women's rights, Prime Minister Modi celebrated the recent Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam, stating, \"Through honest endeavours and new policies, the nation is advancing its daughters.\" He emphasized the significance of connecting people through these social initiatives as a true homage to Maharshi Dayananda.\n\nConcluding his address, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called upon the youth of the DAV network to join the newly formed youth organization MY-Bharat, stating, \"I urge all followers of Swami Dayananda Saraswati to encourage students from the DAV Educational Network to join MY Bharat.\"",

        "text": "In a country like India where socio-economic and political disparities are so deep and wide, the judiciary has a bigger role to play in building an inclusive society.\n\nIn a country like India where socio-economic and political disparities are so deep and wide, the judiciary has a bigger role to play in building an inclusive society. Judiciary is also considered to be a pillar of our democracy, which represents the aspirations of 140 crore people. The malaise of socio-economic discrimination has been significantly checked over the years thanks to our judiciary. It was, therefore, so satisfying to see the Supreme Court of India on January 28, 2024 commemorating 75 years of its inaugural sitting by six judges led by then Chief Justice Harilal J Kania at the Prince's Chamber of the Parliament. These 75 years of the supreme journey of the apex court in pursuits of socio-economic and political justice has really been laudable.\n\nUps and downs, bouquets and criticism, hope and despair, optimism or cynicism, the Supreme Court has played an important role in building a nation where there is no caste-religion or region-based discrimination and exclusion against our own people and is firmly founded on the preamble pillars of equality, justice, fraternity and liberty. Chief Justice Kania in his address at the inaugural sitting stressed three principles or mantras for the Supreme Court's functioning in sync with the constitutional mandate - the top court \"must be independent of the legislature and executive; it must interpret the Constitution not as a rigid body of rules but as a living organism; it must secure the respect of citizens for it to establish itself as a legitimate institution. The confidence of our citizens is determinative of our own legitimacy.\"\n\nThe observation that 'the confidence of our citizens is determinative of our own legitimacy' is very important. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while inaugurating the diamond jubilee celebration of the Supreme Court, said that the makers of our Constitution saw the dream of a free India based on freedom, equality and justice and the Supreme Court has continuously tried to preserve these principles. He also underscored the crucial role of a robust justice system as the cornerstone of Viksit Bharat and highlighted his government's continuous efforts to create a reliable legal framework, while citing the enactment of the Jan Vishwas Bill as a step in the right direction while also reducing the number of pending cases thereby alleviating unnecessary pressure from the judiciary. As we move towards being one of the top five economies of the world, there is a serious alert for the policy makers and conscience keepers in the form of huge pendency of cases in our courts. On December 15, 2023, Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal in a written reply informed the Lok Sabha that as of December 1, 2023 out of the 5,08,85,856 pending cases, over 61 lakh cases were at the level of the 25 high courts. As we all tend to believe in the age-old dictum that justice delayed is justice denied, pendency of a colossal number of cases in courts is debilitating. It is nothing less than a monstrous question mark on our tall claims and their relevance.\n\nI would like to revisit what President Droupadi Murmu said on September 27, 2023 while laying the foundation stone of the new building of Madhya Pradesh High Court in Jabalpur. She said, as was widely reported in media and news agencies, \"Due to the abundance of cases pending in the courts, a large number of undertrial prisoners are forced to stay in the jail. I have said on many occasions that the judiciary, government and police administration should think about undertrial prisoners who are lodged in jails for minor crimes, and find a solution.\" \"Every person associated with the judiciary should make efforts to provide simple, accessible and speedy justice to the general public...About 4.5 crore cases are pending in lower courts across the country and many of these cases are pending for 20 to 30 years,\" she noted.\n\nWhat is agonizing is the fact that the majority of undertrials in our country belong to poor strata of society categorized as SCs, OBCs and STs. President Murmu, in her maiden Constitution Day address on November 26, 2022 at the Supreme Court, herself highlighted the plight of poor tribals of her home state Odisha besides Jharkhand, saying they remain incarcerated despite getting bail for lack of money to furnish the bail amount or arrange sureties. She urged the judiciary to do something for the poor tribals, noting that those accused of serious offences walk out free but these poor inmates, who may have gone to jail for slapping someone, have to spend years on end before they are released.\n\nOn August 21, 2022, then Chief Justice of India-designate Uday Umesh Lalit said the problem of litigation and its repercussions, while formally launching the Legal Aid Defence Counsel (LADC) system in 365 District Legal Services Authorities at an event held at Vigyan Bhawan, New Delhi. According to media reports, he said that over 70 per cent of the population is below the poverty line and only 12 per cent opt for the free legal aid provided by legal services authorities. \"What does the population between 12 per cent to 70 per cent do?\" he said, adding, \"That means the difference between 12 per cent and 70 per cent is not with us. They have solicited the engagement of private counsel...They must have sold their assets; they must have sold their jewellery; they must have mortgaged their properties. That is what the litigation brings in. Litigation is like a bleeding wound. The more you let it bleed, the more will the man suffer,\" he said. An unfortunate situation indeed but who cares.\n\nNow let us see the status of inclusivity in our judiciary! The Union Government on March 17, 2023 informed the Parliament that a total of 569 judges were appointed to the High Courts from 2018. Of the 569 judges, 17 belonged to the Scheduled Castes (SCs), nine to the Scheduled Tribes (STs), 64 to Other Backward Classes (OBCs), and 15 to minority communities. Information on the social background of 20 judges was not available with the government. The then Union Law Minister informed the Lok Sabha that the appointment of judges of the High Courts is made under Articles 217 and 224 of the Constitution, which do not provide for reservation for any caste or class of persons.\n\nHowever, he said, the Central government is committed to social diversity in the appointment of judges in the higher judiciary and has been requesting the Chief Justices of High Courts due consideration be given to suitable candidates belonging to SCs, STs, OBCs, minorities and women to ensure social diversity in appointment of judges to high courts. Their poor representation in the Supreme Court and High Courts is a matter of serious concern. Let us admit the fact that when the judiciary lacks inclusivity, it undermines the fundamental principles of justice and equality upon which it is built. 'Exclusionary practices' within the judiciary can result in biased decision-making, perpetuation of systemic inequalities, and erosion of public trust in the legal system, which hampers our collective efforts aimed at achieving a truly just and equitable society.",

But he was never somebody who worked for awards or waited for recognition,'' she said when asked how her father would have reacted to the award.\n\nSeveral awards came to him, but he was motivated more by the results of what he did on the ground and the people's love and affection, Dr Soumya Swaminathan said.\n\nAsserting that she was ''proud and happy'', Swaminathan said: ''On behalf of the family, we are very thankful and happy that our father has received the Bharat Ratna posthumously.'' Noting that her father has been recognised for his lifetime of contributions to agriculture, but more importantly, for the welfare of farmers and the poorest and most vulnerable in the country, she said it was a matter of ''pride and satisfaction'' that her father's whole life's work has been ''recognised by the government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with the highest national award that any citizen of India can get''.\n\nSpeaking on the significance of the award for future generations, she said that the government's decision, apart from making her father's family, friends, students and well-wishers happy, ''will also send a very strong message to the youth of the country that you can use science and technology to benefit the society''.\n\nShe said that her father always used to remember the farmers he met wherever he went in India. Farmers would meet him and convey their gratitude and their love for him and that is what meant a lot to him. ''Of course, this is a different kind of recognition, so certainly it would have made him very very happy,'' she said.\n\nEarlier announcing the government's decision, Prime Minister Modi said M S Swaminathan made monumental contributions to the country in agriculture and farmers' welfare. He played a pivotal role in helping India achieve self-reliance in agriculture and made outstanding efforts in modernising it, the prime minister said.\n\nSwaminathan, who died last year on September 28 at age 98, is most widely known for transforming India from a drought-stricken country dependent on the United States for foodgrain imports in the 1960s to being declared self-sufficient in food production in 1971.\n\nHis efforts involved introducing high-yielding genetic varieties of rice and wheat in India and the subcontinent, alongside American agronomist Norman Borlaug. Swaminathan was awarded the first World Food Prize in 1987 for his work.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

Recognized by TIME Magazine as one of the twenty most influential Asians of the 20th century, he played a pivotal role in India's self-reliance in agriculture during challenging times. Dr MS Swaminathan, fondly known as the father of India's green revolution, on Friday, was conferred the Bharat Ratna for his contribution to the nation in agriculture and farmers' welfare, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.\n\n\"He played a pivotal role in helping India achieve self-reliance in agriculture during challenging times and made outstanding efforts towards modernizing Indian agriculture. We also recognise his invaluable work as an innovator and mentor and encouraging learning and research among several students,\" PM Modi said in a post on X.\n\nSwaminathan passed away recently at the age of 98, but his contributions to the nation's agriculture landscape remain unparalleled in many ways. The Green Revolution was a programme that paved the way for a huge growth in the production of rice and wheat through the adaptation of chemical-biological technology.\n\nSwaminathan, born on August 7, 1925, in Kumbakonam, Tamil Nadu, earned recognition from TIME Magazine as one of the twenty most influential Asians of the 20th century, alongside Mahatma Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore, making him one of the only three Indians on the esteemed list.\n\nIn the 1960s, Swaminathan successfully persuaded the government that the solution to India's grain shortage was the high-yielding dwarf wheat introduced by US scientist Norman Borlaug in Mexico. He customized the seeds for Indian conditions and provided training to farmers on cultivation.\n\nIn Punjab, the wheat yield surged fivefold within five years, from 1.91 million tonnes in 1965-66 to 5.15 million tonnes in 1970-71.\n\nSwaminathan obtained a Ph.D. in genetics from Cambridge University in the United Kingdom. However, he declined a professorship offer in the United States when he realized that his education aimed at \"producing enough food\" for post-independence India and serving the nation.\n\n\"It was at that time, in 1942, that Gandhiji gave a call for the Quit India Movement. And, in 1942-43, there was the Bengal famine. Many of us, who were students at that time and were very idealistic, asked ourselves, what can we do for an Independent India?\" said Swaminathan, as per a book published by the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation.\n\n\"So I decided, because of the Bengal famine, to study agriculture. I changed my field and went to the Agriculture College at Coimbatore, instead of going to a Medical College,\" Swaminathan said.\n\nSwaminathan's efforts extended beyond farmers, the impoverished, and rural communities; he also promoted the involvement of women in agriculture, advocating for their role not only as labourers but also as co-managers.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)",
