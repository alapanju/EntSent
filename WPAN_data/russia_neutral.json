        "text": "The traditional vote-bases of Kerala's ruling CPI(M) and opposition Congress have \"completely collapsed\" due to the \"worst kind of appeasement politics\" pursued by these parties to win over extremist elements in the state, claims senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar.\n\nIn an interview to PTI, Javadekar, who is the BJP's Kerala in-charge, alleged that the Congress-led UDF and the CPI(M)-headed LDF were fighting the polls solely on the agenda of extremist elements, focusing on issues like CAA and Palestine instead of prioritising a development agenda.\n\nDue to this, the other sections of society, considered to be the backbone of the Left party and the Congress, are \"very much angry\" with them, he claimed.\n\n\"Kerala election has entered a very exciting phase of electioneering. I say this because many earlier equations are collapsing. Earlier, it was Muslims and Christians for the UDF while Ezhavas and other Hindus for the CPI(M). But it has completely collapsed,\" Javadekar claimed.\n\nHe said the BJP is fighting the polls solely on the development agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"The CPI(M)-led LDF and the Congress-led UDF -- both are not talking about the development of India. They are focusing on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). They are discussing Palestine. Today, secularism is Sarv Dharma Sama Bhavana, respect for all religions. But instead, they are preaching...Their agenda is completely focused on competitive appeasement of extremist elements,\" he alleged.\n\nJavadekar, who has been camping in Kerala for the last several months for building the party's campaign for the Lok Sabha polls, claimed the ban imposed on the Islamist outfit Popular Front of India (PFI) by the BJP-led NDA government was welcomed by an entire section of Kerala society.\n\nAnd the Christians are now upset with the Congress after the SDPI, the political arm of PFI, extended its support to the grand old party in the Lok Sabha polls, \"and they are now coming with Narendra Modi-ji,\" he said.\n\n\"The Ezhava community is very much angry with the CPI(M) because it has started the worst kind of appeasement of extremist elements like PFI. Their whole agenda is that extremist elements' agenda. What are they talking about? They are not talking about the development of Kerala,\" Javadekar alleged.\n\nThe former union minister further said the competitive appeasement of extremist elements practiced by the CPI(M) is a real trigger for Christians also to distance themselves from the ruling party.\n\nAnd the Ezhava community and other sections, who traditionally voted for the CPI(M), are now considering voting for BJP because Modi has helped them, Javadekar said.\n\nThe former Union Information and Broadcasting Minister criticised the stand taken by the CPI(M) and the Congress on telecasting the controversial movie \"The Kerala Story\" by various Christian groups in the state, alleging these parties were intervening in the personal freedom of the people and were again merely offering \"lip service\" to extremist elements.\n\nThe Sudipto Sen-directed \"The Kerala Story\", which hit theatres last year, tells the story of a group of women from Kerala who were forced to convert to Islam and join terror outfit ISIS.\n\nJavadekar further said all sections in Kerala, particularly the Christian community, are happy with the steps taken by the Modi government like banning PFI, working against terrorism, condemning the first attack by Hamas militants on Israeli citizens and condemning terror attack in Russia.\n\nThe former union minister also claimed that the Christian community is coming closer to the BJP and will vote for the party, as \"they know that Rahul Gandhi is not going to become the prime minister and the Congress has no future.\"\n\nAsked about the violence in Manipur and the Christian community's concern over it, Javadekar said it was not a Hindu-Christian fight but a conflict between Kukkis and Meitis -- two tribal communities. He accused the Congress and the CPI(M) of \"unleashing a misinformation campaign\" about it in Kerala.\n\nListing the benefits extended to people by the BJP government, Javadekar said, \"Modiji doesn't discriminate,\" while the LDF and the UDF choose their loyalists, favourites, and cadres for extending benefits.\n\nHe said all sections of Kerala society, including Muslims and Christians, are happy with the Modi government because of the development works undertaken by it in the state, including the introduction of Vande Bharat trains and the rapid completion of National Highways.\n\nIn reaching out to the families of expatriates, he noted that Indians living abroad are very happy because India's stature has risen in geopolitics due to PM Modi's diplomacy. He also recalled the missions undertaken by the Modi government to rescue priests, nurses, and students stranded in conflict zones like Yemen, Iraq, and Ukraine.\n\n\"So, therefore, it is an exciting phase of the election. We are making a big impact, and people will truly understand on June 4 (the day the votes are counted),\" he said.",

        "text": "I expect many of us who see Trump for what he is -- that is, a self-demonstrated threat to American democracy -- have struggled with that matter and perhaps given up on ever getting through. We are in a period that might well be called The Great Rationalization, a time when many of our fellow citizens have developed tissue-thin justifications for continuing to support a pronounced authoritarian who tried to subvert the last election.\n\nIf you believe in reason and rationality, it is a puzzling and frustrating situation.\n\nBack during the George W. Bush administration, when left-wing types would email to express their worries that Bush wouldn't leave office if he lost in 2004 or perhaps not even at the end of a second term in 2008, I would reply that that was simply silly. Whatever one thought of his politics, George W. believed in our Constitution, our democracy, and our system of government. As the scion of a well-regarded family with a long record of public service, he obviously would have put the country above himself. He would never have attempted an auto-coup.\n\nBut as we saw with Trump's repeated lie about a stolen 2020 presidential election, his scheming to overturn the legitimate results, his summoning his supporters to Washington, and then his sending them to the Capitol with the instruction that \"if you don't fight like hell\" to block the congressional certification of Joe Biden's win, \"you're not going to have a country anymore,\" Trump puts himself above country and Constitution.\n\nYet he retains the backing of many who consider themselves supporters and defenders of the Constitution and of American democracy. In part, that's because they have let themselves be deluded into believing there was a concerted \"Deep State\" effort to undermine Trump. Or that President Biden somehow ordered the four different sets of criminal indictments the former president now faces.\n\nNone of that is true, of course. Special counsel John Durham's long probe of the FBI's investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia ended with much more of a whimper than a bang. It certainly didn't expose a determined Deep State attempt to undermine Trump. Had there been such an effort, surely the anti-Trump cabal would have leaked word just before the 2020 election that the FBI was investigating the Trump campaign. In all likelihood, the resulting stories would have sunk Trump's election chances.\n\nSecondly, two sets of the four rounds of criminal charges against Trump were initiated by county-level prosecutors in New York and Georgia. Biden has no power to order them to do anything. Further, the two sets of federal charges were brought by special counsel Jack Smith, whom Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed specifically to distance the investigation from the Department of Justice.\n\nIt seldom matters with Trump supporters, however, when you run through the particulars that should disabuse them of their preconceptions. They quickly retrench behind a different rationalization or conspiracy theory. Sometimes, despite the well-documented fact that the post-World War II economy has fared considerably better under Democratic presidents than Republican ones, it's the hoary canard that Democrats are crypto-Marxists, just waiting to spring communism on the country.\n\nSo, readers, here's my first question: Have you found a way to get through to your Trump-supporting family members, friends, or acquaintances? That is, have you developed arguments that help clear the conspiratorialist fog that keeps them from seeing Trump for what he is? If so, please share how you made that breakthrough.\n\nI have a second query as well. In the 2020 election cycle, I highlighted several promising efforts to recruit new voters and encourage infrequent ones, efforts that Blue State voters could engage to help in swing states.\n\nAre you involved with such an effort with an organization that you consider well-run and effective? If so, please send me an email about that group.\n\nI'm hoping your responses to one or both of these questions will provide civically useful subjects for columns later in this election season.",

        "text": "Last week, Russia vetoed action to renew the panel of experts' mandate to assist the Council's DPRK sanctions committee.\n\nSharp divisions emerged on Thursday as the General Assembly debated Russia's veto on the Security Council which blocked renewal of the sanctions panel that monitors the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) nuclear weapon and missile programmes.\n\nThis is the third time this year that the world body has met to examine veto use among the Security Council's permanent members - China, France, Russia, United Kingdom and United States - including on the situation in Gaza regarding a US veto.\n\nLast week, Russia vetoed action to renew the panel of experts' mandate to assist the Council's DPRK sanctions committee. Current sanctions include an arms embargo and measures to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, ballistic missiles and other mass destruction-related programmes.\n\nAt the outset of Thursday's meeting, Assembly President Dennis Francis told ambassadors that the recurring use of the veto undermines international peace and security.\n\n\"The spectre of nuclear conflict must compel us to move from rhetoric to tangible action,\" he said, recalling his visit in October to the demilitarised zone between the Republic of Korea and DPRK - more commonly known as South and North Korea respectively - underlining that the current situation is tense.\n\nNew draft resolution\n\nRussian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said his delegation had vetoed the draft resolution tabled by the United States for a number of reasons, among them that extending the panel of experts' mandate would not contribute to normalising the situation on the Korean Peninsula.\n\n\"The basic mechanisms of the sanctions are failing,\" he said, noting that all other restrictive measures against States are subject to review, but none of that applies to DPRK. \"The indefinite maintenance of draconian measures is doomed to fail.\"\n\nThe panel had been reduced to kowtowing to Western powers amid aggressive propaganda and sabre rattling, he said, while underlining that the sanctions have had severe humanitarian consequences.\n\nAs such, he said Russia plans to submit shortly a draft resolution to extend the panel's mandate for one year, with a clear determination for the Security Council to update the parameters of the sanctions regime.\n\nDPRK condemns double standards\n\nAmbassador Kim Song of DPRK said nuclear weapons are stockpiled in many countries, including the US, yet Pyongyang is the only one facing sanctions.\n\nInhumane double standards exist in terms of States rights to defend themselves, he said, adding that Council sanctions are the product of the \"heinous policies\" of the US that hinder DPRK's sovereignty, right to development and existence.\n\n\"This meeting today is not a simple gathering to hear and understand the exercise of the veto,\" the ambassador said.\n\n\"Rather, it serves as an important occasion to determined whether we will leave Security Council to be a tool of the United States...or we make the Council to ensure justice and impartiality and perform its function as required by the international community.\"\n\nChina: Sanctions must not be 'carved in stone'\n\nDeputy Permanent Representative Geng Shuang of China said the Korean War has long ended, \"but the cold war mentality is still lingering\".\n\nThere will be no resolution of the current issues if the security concerns of all parties, including DPRK, remain unaddressed, he said, calling on relevant actors to work together to denuclearise the Korean Peninsula and adopt a path to peace.\n\nThe current tensions are stymying those efforts, he said, emphasising that dialogue and a political settlement of the matter is needed and the Council must play an active role.\n\n\"Sanctions should not be carved in stone,\" he said, adding that \"harsh sanctions\" against DPRK have had a negative effect on the humanitarian situation in the country.\n\nRegarding Russia's new proposal, he expressed hope that Council members will work productively to extend the panel of experts' mandate.\n\nRepublic of Korea: Veto will not silence ongoing efforts\n\nThe representative of the Republic of Korea said the veto sends \"a dangerous message\" and could have a cascading effect on other Council sanctions.\n\nThe panel will cease to exist in three weeks, but the sanctions remain in place, he said, encouraging all Member States to abide by these provisions.\n\nIn terms of the humanitarian situation, he said the international community has attempted to send aid, Pyongyang had declined.\n\n\"The veto will not silence the global non-proliferation regime,\" he said, pledging his delegation's efforts towards the proper functioning of the Security Council and its mechanism for the complete and verifiable denuclearisation of DPRK.\n\nUS: 'We need to uphold our obligations'\n\nRobert Wood, Deputy Permanent Representative of the United States, said that as the draft resolution's penholder, his delegation had sought widespread engagement and that China and Russia have had ample opportunities to discuss sanctions reform in the Council.\n\nInstead, Russia gave Council members an ultimatum that sought one of two outcomes: to prevent sanctions against DPRK or to silence the panel's investigations, including into Moscow's procurement of weapons from Pyongyang for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussia's veto undermines the peace and security architecture and deprives action on one of the Council's most pressing issues, that of peace on the Korean Peninsula, Mr. Wood said.\n\n\"Russia's already threatening to terminate more UN sanctions mandates that help the Security Council monitor and take action to deter threats to international peace and security,\" he said. \"This is why it is critical for all of us to raise our voices today in support of the non-proliferation regime, and in opposition to attempts to silence information, we need to uphold our obligations.\"",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests.

None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said.

        "title": "Russian soldiers who quit Putin's war get no hero's welcome abroad as asylum claims surge",
        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "title": "Food Security and Food Safety in Africa Must Go Hand in Hand",
        "text": "LUSAKA, Zambia, Apr 12 (IPS) - Monica Musonda, CEO, Java Foods, and Board Member, Partners in Food Solutions (PFS)Russia's invasion of Ukraine has restricted international exports and sent food costs soaring - particularly for vulnerable populations still experiencing shocks from the pandemic and who can least afford to pay more to feed their families. Two years on, global food supply chains are still just as susceptible to serious disruptions caused by war, disease, and climate change. Those inevitable disruptions are leaving those on the African continent particularly vulnerable.\n\nEnsuring people have access to safe and nutritious food at an affordable price helps prevent malnutrition, boosts human capital, and improves health outcomes by decreasing susceptibility to a wide range of diseases. But none of this is possible if the local food supply is not safe for people to eat. Food security and food safety must go hand in hand, yet across Africa this remains a challenge. The continent has some of the highest rates of foodborne illness in the world. Globally, nearly half a million people die each year because of something they ate. Food scares are not only harmful for anyone who eats contaminated food, but also erodes trust of consumers in the products they buy for their families. To ensure a secure food supply, locally produced food must not only be readily available but also be safe for consumers to eat, meeting the same high-quality standards seen in imports. But small and medium-sized companies in Africa struggle to meet international food safety standards, which often go above what is required on a national level. The process can be complicated, expensive, and time consuming, yet I believe it is vital for African food companies to seek these certifications to build consumer confidence and strengthen continental food security. I started Java Foods, a food company based in Lusaka, Zambia, out of the recognition that Africa imports large quantities of food, despite the fact that the continent is able to grow a diversity of crops. Our company focuses on using locally grown raw materials in our products, which we've designed specifically for the changing tastes of the youthful Zambian population. One of our most successful products are packaged instant noodles, under the brand name eeZee, which are made with locally grown wheat fortified with 17 micronutrients, including iron and zinc. Although we produce processed foods, we want to ensure the highest nutritional value possible for our consumers who seek accessible and affordable food options. Maintaining high-quality food safety standards is the right thing to do for the consumer, and it has been the right thing to do for Java Foods - even if it has required significant investments in our facility and in our people. Food safety certification has to be paid for. The different sets of standards are run by private companies, which require food producers to buy the certification they want to implement and renew the certification every couple of years. Audits to ensure compliance are also costly. With technical assistance from Partners in Food Solutions, a nonprofit which links African food producers with corporate volunteers from U.S.-based food companies, Java Foods was able to receive support in redesigning our plant to ensure we'll be compliant with international food safety standards. Our employees benefited from skills transfer using online conferencing tools that dramatically increased their professional skills and contributions to our team. In addition to making changes to our factory floor plan, we also began a meticulous documentation process to create the records necessary to demonstrate that we were following the same standards to a T on every single batch of instant noodles. Our staff are central to getting this right, so Java Foods has created a culture where our employees understand why we take these extra steps, and take pride in ensuring our compliance. It is possible for other companies to follow in Java's footsteps. There are several ways we can improve the food safety certification system to mutually benefit consumers, food processors, and regulating authorities. In addition to better awareness of the existence of food safety standards and why companies should seek such certification to benefit their consumers, there needs to be more coordination on a regional and global level. Java Foods exports our products to neighboring countries, but each can require different steps to comply with their local regulations. Exporting our noodles to Zimbabwe, for example, requires us to complete an extra step not required elsewhere. This means we shoulder extra expenses to expand our market, which cannot be passed along to the consumer because we make a low-cost product. Differing food safety standards become a trade barrier not only restricting the growth of businesses in Africa, but restricting food security as strengthening regional supply chains remains hampered by cumbersome regulations. Local governments need more support to strengthen their food safety quality control capacity. This includes the facilities they provide for testing for food contaminants such as aflatoxins, from a mold that can develop on some crops when they aren't stored properly. We also need better information sharing and data availability. Having information readily available online when our staff encounter an issue would save time and resources. Although it was laborious, Java Foods has immensely benefited from the decision to seek international food safety certification. The standards allow us to expand the market for our products, and we must ensure other companies can easily join us to strengthen Africa's food security. Monica Musonda is the CEO of Java Foods, a food manufacturing company in Lusaka, Zambia. She serves on the board of Partners in Food Solutions, a nonprofit organization that provides pro bono consulting services to African food processors.",

        "title": "Niger's future after the end of military cooperation with the US",
        "text": "A few weeks ago, Niger's ruling military junta announced the suspension with immediate effect of the military agreement allowing the presence of US military and civilian personnel on its territory. The coup government spokesman stopped short of demanding that US personnel leave, but stressed that their presence violates sovereignty.\n\nFollowing this declaration, defence cooperation between Niger and the US is expected to end, as well as the departure of US forces from Niger, which will facilitate the deployment of Russian paramilitary personnel in the country, as has happened elsewhere in the Sahel.\n\nIn 2023, the year of the coup d'\u00e9tat, there were around 1,100 US troops in Niger. Bilateral defence cooperation between Niamey and Washington includes, in particular, an agreement allowing the presence of around 1,000 US civilian and military personnel, as well as two military installations in Niger, including Air Base 201 near Agadez, which is essential for US surveillance and counter-terrorism operations in Niger and neighbouring Libya.\n\nHowever, the US is not the only country in the crosshairs of Niger's new military regime. After the July 2023 uprising against democratically elected president Mohamed Bazoum, the new government immediately suspended military cooperation with France, prompting Paris to withdraw its forces in December.\n\nFrance criticised Niger's coup immediately after it took place, unlike the US, which initially adopted a more cautious approach towards its leaders in the hope of retaining its military facilities in the country. Attempts to ensure a rapid transition to civilian leadership were unsuccessful, however, and US President Joe Biden's administration eventually labelled Bazoum's overthrow a coup d'\u00e9tat in October 2023.\n\nThis led the US authorities to suspend all forms of non-humanitarian security cooperation, including defence. This was accompanied by France's decision to withdraw its forces from the country, which reinforced the military junta's need to develop relations with new partners such as Russia, further deteriorating relations with Washington.\n\nThese tensions came to a head during a US diplomatic trip to Niger last March. During the visit, the US delegation reiterated its demands, calling for a credible transition timetable for civilian leadership before the US resumes defence cooperation. They also warned Niamey against further cooperation with Russia and Iran.\n\nNiger's military leaders cannot respond to Washington's demands without compromising their control over the country. Indeed, the military junta decided to take advantage of tensions with the West to strengthen its power and end defence cooperation in order to reinforce its image in terms of sovereignty and anti-imperialism in the eyes of the Nigerien public.\n\nRegarding relations with Russia and Iran, it is worth noting that Niamey and Tehran have strengthened their ties in recent months. There has even been talk of a possible deal whereby Niger would supply uranium to Iran, although the logistics of this alleged deal remain in doubt, as Niger has only one major uranium mine in production, currently run by the French state-owned company Orano.\n\nIn addition to strengthening ties with Iran, Niger has signed a defence protocol agreement with Russia in which both sides pledge to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the fields of defence, agriculture and energy.\n\nAll of these moves by Niger's authorities are forcing the US to withdraw its forces in the nation, which will undermine Washington's ability to monitor jihadist activity in the Sahel.\n\nAfter the military junta declared the US military presence in Niger \"illegal\", most of the Nigerien public expects US forces to leave the country. Should this not happen and the authorities fail to deliver on their promises, it would create a political challenge, as the new regime based its legitimacy on promises to restore Niger's full sovereignty, as stated by the head of the military junta, General Abdourahamane Tchiani.\n\nShould the military regime allow the US to maintain some military presence in the country - there are still sections of the Nigerien army that support it - this could raise the possibility of a new coup d'\u00e9tat by the more anti-Western elements of the military junta.\n\nAs Tchiani prioritises the consolidation of his power, it seems likely that the US will be forced to evacuate its forces and military installations from Niger over the next year. However, it is possible that this process could be postponed, as the Biden administration is likely to continue to pressure Tchiani not to suspend defence cooperation altogether.\n\nIt is also possible that Washington will accelerate its efforts to establish a drone base in other parts of West Africa, such as Ghana, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire or Benin. While the establishment of a new drone base in one of these locations will help the US monitor potential jihadist challenges in West African coastal areas, it will not be useful for monitoring jihadist activity in the Sahel due to its geographical distance from the area.\n\nThis African region is experiencing a deployment of Russian paramilitary personnel, as well as an expansion of jihadist activity. It is possible that this is the future that awaits Niger should it suspend its defence ties with Washington.\n\nDespite instability and violence in many Sahelian countries, Niger's junta appears to be willing to follow in the footsteps of military leaders in Mali and Burkina Faso by requesting the deployment of Russian paramilitary personnel in the country.\n\nWhile such military backing could help the Niger junta consolidate its power, the arrival of Russian paramilitary personnel in the country will contribute to undermining the country's security in the medium term, as Russia's African Legion does not have the same military capabilities as the US or French armies.\n\nIn this regard, it should also be noted that Russian forces deployed in African countries have committed numerous human rights violations against civilians, which in Niger will facilitate recruitment efforts by jihadist groups such as the al-Qaeda-linked Islamic and Muslim Support Group and Daesh in the Sahel.\n\nDespite this, Tchiani held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the end of March in which the two leaders agreed on the 'need' to strengthen bilateral security cooperation. This conversation came shortly after the suspension of defence cooperation with the US.\n\nHowever, Niger will also continue to develop relations with other non-Western countries in order to avoid excessive dependence on Moscow, as has happened to other countries in the region. This may boost competition among Middle Eastern and North African countries seeking closer ties with Niamey.\n\nThe deployment of Russian paramilitary personnel in Niger will allow Moscow to strengthen its influence over the junta. But the military council's domestic diplomatic and political needs will push it to further develop its relations with other nations, such as Iran.\n\nAli Lamine Zeine, Niger's junta-appointed prime minister, met with Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi during his official visit to Tehran in January. The Iranian leader praised Niger's \"path to independence and freedom\" before the two sides signed agreements to strengthen health, economic and political cooperation.\n\nArab Gulf states can also play a role in gaining a stronger presence in Niger due to their fears of expanding Iranian influence in Africa. Expanding this cooperation between the Gulf states and Niger could pave the way for much-needed foreign investment in the country.\n\nNiger will also continue to strengthen relations with Turkey, which has provided Niamey with military support before and after the July 2023 coup, in addition to funding development initiatives.\n\nIn this regard, Ankara delivered six Bayraktar TB3 drones to Niger during May 2022 and continued its efforts to train the Nigerien army after the July 2023 coup.\n\nWithin the continent, Morocco is expected to further strengthen its ties with Niger, as well as with Mali and Burkina Faso, especially by pushing ahead with plans to help Western Sahel countries diversify their maritime outlets through Moroccan ports.\n\nWhile the Atlantic Initiative seems unlikely to be achieved in the medium term due to infrastructure problems, this project highlights the Kingdom's ambition to strengthen its position as a regional and continental leader.\n\nThese moves are likely to increase competition between Morocco and Algeria for regional leadership. Meanwhile, Niger's junta will seek to exploit this rivalry to maximise investment commitments on both sides.",

        "text": "Washington, DC [US], April 12 (ANI): The United States' defence commitments to Japan and the Philippines are \"ironclad,\" US President Joe Biden said on Thursday as he hosted the first-ever trilateral summit between the three countries, welcoming Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr to the White House a day after the official visit of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, CNN reported.\n\nThe US-Japan-Philippines trilateral comes after the creation of groupings in the Indo-Pacific, starting with the Quad, comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan, and the AUKUS, consisting of Australia, the US and the UK, amid increasing concerns over China's military muscle-flexing in the region.\n\n\"When we stand as one, we're able to forge a better future for all,\" Biden said in the East Room of the White House Thursday.\n\nAccording to CNN, tensions between the Philippines and China have been focused on the Second Thomas Shoal, situated approximately 200 kilometres off the coast of Palawan, Philippines. In the 1990s, the Philippines intentionally grounded an aging World War II-era navy transport ship on the shoal to reinforce its territorial claim. The ship is now mostly a rusted wreckage and is manned by Filipino marines stationed on rotation.\n\nMeanwhile, China asserts sovereignty over the shoal, located within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, as part of its broader claims in the South China Sea, disregarding an international arbitration ruling.\n\nRecent clashes have occurred when Philippine attempts to resupply the forces on the ship have been met by China Coast Guard ships firing water cannons at the Philippine resupply boats, resulting in injuries to Filipino sailors and damage to the vessels, as per CNN.\n\nBiden said on Thursday, referencing the Filipino-Chinese tensions, that \"any attack on Philippine aircraft, vessels or armed forces in the South China Sea would invoke our mutual defence treaty.\"The 1951 mutual defence treaty between the US and the Philippines, the oldest of its kind in the Asia-Pacific region, obligates both nations to come to each other's defence in the event of an attack by a third party.\n\nThursday's meeting signifies the administration's ongoing efforts to address Chinese aggression, with a senior administration official expressing deep concern over China's actions in the South China Sea, and affirming at the head of the meeting that the White House is very concerned by China's actions in the South China Sea.\n\n\"What you'll see is a clear demonstration of support and resolve from both President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida that we stand shoulder to shoulder with Marcos, ready to support and work with the Philippines at every turn,\" one official said ahead of Thursday's meeting.\n\nMarcos said on Thursday that the Philippines, Japan and the United States \"meet today as friends and partners bound by a shared vision in pursuit of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.\"The three countries, Marcos added, are \"linked by a profound respect for democracy, good governance and the rule of law.\"The meeting coincides with heightened concerns over China's assertive stance towards Taiwan and the South China Sea, coupled with nuclear provocations from North Korea and its evolving ties with Russia. These concerns have prompted regional allies to draw closer to the US.\n\nJapan has emerged as a focal point in President Biden's efforts to strengthen alliances in the Indo-Pacific. Prime Minister Kishida has been viewed as a cooperative partner, having made significant adjustments to Japan's defence strategy in recent years. Additionally, Japan has provided ongoing support to Ukraine in the wake of Russia's invasion, demonstrating its commitment to international security. Kishida has pledged to increase defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP by 2037 and has bolstered Japan's counterstrike capabilities by acquiring American Tomahawk missiles.\n\nBiden hosted Marcos at the White House last year, showing his intent to reestablish strong ties with Manila that had frayed under former President Rodrigo Duterte, who sought closer relations with China.\n\n\"We're going to continue to support the Philippines military's modernization goals,\" Biden told the visiting leader during that visit, pledging the two nations \"not only share a strong partnership, we share a deep friendship, one that has been enriched by millions of Filipino Americans in the communities all across the United States.\"A highlight of Thursday's meeting was several announcements meant to bolster the Philippines.\n\nA senior administration official also said that on Thursday, the White House will be announcing a new infrastructure project in the Philippines. CNN reported earlier this week that one of the announcements will be the development of a new rail and shipping corridor between the Philippines's Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base, a move that's meant to send a clear message to Beijing.\n\nBiden briefly referenced that economic corridor on Thursday: \"It means more jobs for people across the entire region,\" he said. \"It means more investment in sectors critical to our future: clean energy, ports, railroads, agriculture and much more.\"The White House is also expected to increase the Filipino military's capability with a new infrastructure investment similar to what the US announced in India in the lead-up to the G20.\n\nIn the days leading up to the summit, the US, Japan and the Philippines along with Australia, conducted maritime military exercises near the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), after Philippine vessels had alleged \"harassment\" by Chinese ships in the South China Sea.\n\nThe senior official added that the White House will also be making announcements about \"Open Radio Access Network technology\" and that both the US and Japan will be providing millions of dollars in funding.\n\nOfficials also said they will announce an upcoming Coast Guard patrol in the Indo-Pacific that will take place \"in the coming year.\" (ANI)",

        "title": "Martin Seiff: Diplomacy Matters - Russia News Now",
        "text": "Eminent economist Professor Jeffrery Sachs was for many years a senior adviser to two Secretary Generals of the United Nations: It is a national tragedy that President Joe Biden has not taken him into the White House in the same role.\n\nFor Sachs has just published another immensely important article: Entitled \"The Urgency of Diplomacy\", it points out that the United States, with its neutered eunuch European allies tamely in tow, has now long since abandoned all pretense at any kind of serious diplomacy, negotiations, dialogue or efforts to achieve and maintain mutual coexistence in the world with either Russia or China.\n\nAs usual, Sachs does not mince his words:\n\n\"There has been a complete collapse of diplomacy between the US and Russia, and a near-total collapse between the US and China,\" he writes. \"Europe, which has made itself far too dependent on the US for its own good, simply follows the Washington line. The absence of diplomacy creates a dynamic of escalation that can lead to nuclear war.\"\n\nThe current president of Latvia, Edgars Rink\u0113vi\u010ds, Sachs noted, recently tweeted, \"Russia must be destroyed.\"\n\nLatvia is a tiny postage stamp country of less than 1.9 million people. It would not make more than a tiny proportion of New York City, Washington, London, Los Angeles or Paris. It could not maintain its prosperity and security for five seconds without enormous inputs every year from the European Union, the United States and NATO. Yet there it is, with its president and diplomats eagerly - even enthusiastically - fanning the flames for thermonuclear war between America and Russia. This is no mere joke: It is an obscenity.\n\nThe practice of diplomacy in the United States has shriveled into a sick joke for decades. General Colin Powell was the last secretary of state who practiced it responsibly and seriously.\n\nHillary Clinton happily reverted to the ludicrous global bullying and bigoted ultraliberal intolerance of her bosom buddy Madeleine Albright. In Michael McFaul she even appointed to Moscow and fully supported a US ambassador who openly ridiculed, sneered and sought to discredit the established leader of a thermonuclear superpower capable of incinerating the United States, as if this could and would have no consequence. President Barack Obama, a vain, superficial and ridiculous man, did not care.\n\nJohn Kerry was a weak, even farcical secretary of state in his priorities and passivity in the face of the hijacking of his department by mad neoconservative and neoliberal lunatics such as McFaul, Victoria Nuland and other personal favorites of Hillary Clinton.\n\nYet even Kerry recognized the need to get on personally with and maintain communication and a modicum of respect towards his immensely experienced and responsible Russian opposite number Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.\n\nHowever, since Kerry left office at the beginning of 2017, there has not been even that.\n\nPresident Donald Trump briefly toyed with appointing a responsible, dignified secretary of state in Rex Tillerson at the very beginning of his administration: It did not last. Trump tired of Tillerson, the way a petulant child tires of a boring toy and dropped him after only 14 months. Thereafter, Trump threw the reins of diplomacy over to his CIA Director Mike Pompeo, another fake macho, ignorant, brutish boor and simplistic clown in whom he was well pleased.\n\nIn fact, neither the liberal Democratic fake Left nor the ignorant, blundering, fake macho Right has a clue as to how serious diplomacy in the national interest can and should be conducted.\n\nThe Left has long chased after vague, multilateral, global will o' the wisp agreements to abolish all nuclear power and weapons, deindustrialize the globe and create a new fantasy sustainable green prosperity without any recourse to oil, coal or natural gas power sources at all. The idea of promoting and safeguarding the genuine national interests of the American people is abhorrent to it.\n\nThe Old Right reveres Free Trade as if it was handed down by the Founding Fathers, rather than swallowed wholesale under Ronald Reagan after being a Liberal Democratic Idol for the previous two centuries. And it has never yet found a defenseless country it could resist bombing into catastrophic collapse. There are no human rights to be gallantly defended when their supposed recipients have been killed and crippled beneath millions of tons of rubble.\n\nThe Liberal Left and the Neocon Right alike endlessly preach the value of human rights wildly seeking to destabilize major powers from Russia and China to India while lacking the guts and practicality to ever take any concrete action to prevent the most monstrous genocides and collapse of societies triggered by Western aggressive actions around the world from Biafra in the 1960s to Syria and Libya over the past decade.\n\nAs for the current President of the United States, he early on set the standard for global dignity and reduction of international tensions by publicly referring to the President of Russia as \"a crazy SOB\".\n\nIn fairness to Biden, he was probably just looking in a mirror and mistook himself for President Vladimir Putin when he made that remark.\n\nBiden then set a new standard for imbecility when he stated, as Professor Sachs also noted, about President Xi Jinping of China, \"For God's sake, this man cannot remain in power\" before sending 100-year-old former secretary of state Henry Kissinger to Beijing to please beg the Chinese to stop selling US Treasuries.\n\n\"It has been the US and its allies that have broken agreements and refused diplomacy. The US violated its solemn pledges to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and to Russian President Boris Yeltsin that NATO would not move one inch eastward,\" Sachs noted.\n\nProfessor Sachs of course is doing no more than repeating what should be an obvious truth. I covered those negotiations at the time and often interviewed many of the key negotiators on both sides. And I can certainly confirm the accuracy of Sachs' account.\n\nSachs further recalls, \"The US cheated by supporting the violent coup in Kiev that toppled Ukraine's President Viktor Yanukovych. The US, Germany, France, and the UK, duplicitously refused to back the Minsk II agreement.\"\n\nIndeed, they did so refuse: And the awful slaughter of half a million Ukrainian boys and young men in a war that Washington's neocons and neo-libs still want to fight to the last drop of blood - of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples - never of their own - still continues.\n\nFurther, it was, as Professor Sachs also records, the United States that unilaterally withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2022 and from the Intermediate Force Agreement in 2019. And it was the United States, not Russia that refused to negotiate when Putin proposed a draft Russia-US Treaty on Security Guarantees on December 15, 2021.\n\nAmazingly, as Sachs documents, there has been no direct diplomacy whatsoever between Biden and Putin since the beginning of 2022. And when Russia and Ukraine negotiated directly in March 2022, the United States and the United Kingdom stepped in to block any agreement that would be based on Ukrainian neutrality - a dignified and freedom-preserving future for that great people and tragic land.\n\nDiplomacy Matters - And so does its Lack.\n\nThe political leadership of the United States, Right and Left, Republican and Democrat, male and female, is now in the hands of a generation of ignorant, spoiled brats who are incapable of ever admitting their own incompetence - and that they are ever, indeed always, wrong.\n\nAmerica's leaders, serene in their stupidity and impregnable self-righteousness, continue to self-indulgently fan awful, endless wars that they refuse -on what they think is principle - to ever settle or end.\n\nThey have set the whole world ablaze. And soon the fires they have lit everywhere, like the Biblical Fool excoriated in the Book of Proverbs, will devour them.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military.

Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nUkrainian commander Odin's lower leg was blown off in a mine explosion last year. He's now back in the trenches.\n\n\"I had offers to go back to my local academy as a teacher or to work at a draft office in Odesa,\" the 32-year-old from the 28th Separate Mechanised Brigade said from a cramped bunker on the front line in the eastern region of Donetsk.\n\n\"I said I'm not interested in these positions.\"\n\nMango, a 28-year-old tank gunner, saw his hand shredded by shrapnel two years ago during fighting in Mariupol before he was captured by the Russians. He too has returned to the front, as logistics chief for a battalion in the Azov Brigade, which held out for months in defence of the southern city.\n\nUkraine's drained and depleted army needs all the help it can get. It is being driven back by its far larger, more powerful enemy around the eastern city of Avdiivka while coming under increasing pressure at other sections of the front.\n\n\"When I got back from captivity, I realised the war wasn't over,\" said Mango, who like Odin and most Ukrainian soldiers goes by his military call sign for security reasons.\n\n\"Even though I can't sit inside a tank, I can still be useful. I can still fight a bit.\"\n\nThe two soldiers are among thousands of Ukrainian troops who have lost limbs since Russia launched a full-scale invasion in early 2022. While the Kyiv government declined to share data on casualties, which it deems sensitive, Pryncyp, a leading human rights organisation representing military personnel, put the number of amputees from the war at between 20,000 and 50,000.\n\nBattlefields are littered with mines, while artillery and drone attacks are a constant menace, meaning the grim number is rising steadily.\n\nReuters interviewed 20 military amputees for this article, seven of whom had returned to the army or intended to do so. For many of those able to do so, the desire to support their beleaguered comrades on the battlefield remains strong.\n\nMasi Nayyem, co-founder of Pryncyp, said it was fairly common to see soldiers with artificial limbs still serving, though he didn't know how many had returned to the military and how many had entered civilian life.\n\nThe nature of their role will often be decided by the extent of the injuries, said Nayyem, who lost an eye in combat in June 2022. Soldiers with amputations below the knee, for example, are often deemed fit for service in support units but not for highly mobile or specialized roles, according to Pryncyp.\n\nTony Bloomfield, operations director at the British military charity for limbless veterans Blesma, said it was generally extremely rare for soldiers who have lost a limb to return to the conflict, but that this was happening in Ukraine.\n\n\"The nature of the conflict is leaving lots of limb loss,\" said Bloomfield, whose team has spent time with wounded Ukrainian soldiers to help them adapt to limb loss, adding that artillery barrages were a major cause of the injuries.\n\n\"Some of the Ukrainians we met, yes absolutely they want to go back and fight if they're able to,\" he said. \"The difference here again, for Ukraine, is that if you leave the military, your country is still at war. And you're still at risk of injury.\"\n\nKyiv is desperate to replenish its ranks.\n\nSoldiers say they are outnumbered and outgunned along the 1,000-km front line in the east and south of Ukraine. During Moscow's months-long assault on Avdiivka, some Ukrainian troops said they had been outnumbered by around seven to one.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy signed a bill this month to lower the draft age from 27 to 25, while a mobilisation bill aimed at drafting potentially hundreds of thousands more troops has made its way only slowly through parliament.\n\nBoth Odin and Mango - career soldiers who were in the military before the Russian invasion - expressed a sense of responsibility for the soldiers they had left behind in the trenches and of guilt that they had survived their injuries and could live in relative safety away from the fighting.\n\nOdin had little hesitation in asking superiors for permission to return to combat after he had undergone surgery and rehabilitation with a prosthetic limb.\n\nAt his mortar position in Donetsk, he moves freely up and down the trenches, speaking with members of his unit and giving orders. But he says he still has an intense fear of triggering a mine again as he fights Russian forces.\n\n\"Despite some saying everything was bad and that continuing a normal life was impossible, I'm living a full life,\" he said later, perched on a bed in the bunker and lifting a trouser leg to reveal his prosthetic limb.\n\n\"It's just different twice a day: in the morning when I put on the prosthesis and at night when I take it off,\" he added.\n\nMango was one of hundreds of Ukrainians defending the Azostal steel plant in an ultimately futile last stand to hold the city of Mariupol before it fell in May 2022.\n\n\"I wanted to check my watch to see what time it was,\" he recalled of the day of the injury. \"I raised my hand, saw my watch wasn't there any more. My hand was completely shredded, bones sticking out and all.\"\n\nConvincing top brass that he still had a military role to play was not easy. Mango said he had to ask his commander to submit a report to the authorities confirming that there was a suitable position for him in the unit.\n\n\"At every medical check-up, there was always one surgeon who would ask if I had reconsidered my decision, and each time I said 'No',\" said Mango, who's hoping to have a bionic hand fitted to allow him to use artificial fingers.\n\nIn some ways, said the amputees interviewed, those who don't return to the military find the transition to civilian life even harder to navigate.\n\nLeaving the army means negotiating a new set of challenges, from getting around a town or apartment to finding a job, as well as dealing with civilians who don't always know how to act when they come into contact with amputees.\n\nThe government provides high-quality prosthetics to those who lose limbs in combat as well as rehabilitation treatment. War amputees also receive payouts that vary according to the severity of the injuries. There is money available for servicing artificial limbs and individuals can raise funds privately or through charities for advanced prosthetics such as bionic hands.\n\nNayyem, of soldiers' rights group Pryncyp, said the government was not doing enough to support amputees as they seek employment and that those initiatives that did exist were focused on the big cities.\n\n\"I mean, the state prioritised sending you to die, but didn't make it a priority to help you recover when you got injured,\" he said. \"All the wounded feel this.\"\n\nHe added that the number of people affected by amputations, either directly or indirectly, would only climb as the war ground on with no end in sight.\n\nUkraine's Veteran Affairs Ministry, which oversees amputees, didn't respond when asked about criticism that it was not doing enough to support amputees, particularly over the longer term.\n\nOleksandr Revtiukh lost his left arm and most of his left leg in multiple mine blasts while fighting Russian forces during last summer's counteroffensive in the south, making a return to combat virtually impossible.\n\nWhile the traumas of the war remain, the 33-year-old is focusing on his future outside of the military. The former electronics technician, who enlisted to fight months after Russia's February 2022 invasion, wants to build a social media profile as a motivational boxing coach for fellow amputees.\n\n\"Don't be afraid to make mistakes,\" he said. \"Look for a way out, there is a path through the thorns to the stars. This is my motto.\"\n\nBy Thomas Peter\n\nOleksandr Revtiukh fires a vicious hook at the seasoned fighter facing him. He's in the boxing ring, eight months after losing his left arm and most of his left leg in mine blasts while fighting in Ukraine.\n\nRevtiukh follows with a snarling jab. His old life is gone. Only two years ago he had enjoyed a comfortable civilian life as an electronics technician abroad, before he returned to Ukraine to sign up and fight the Russian invasion.\n\nA furious uppercut, bellowing with the effort. The war has left trauma. Now he has to accept what has happened to him and learn to live without his lost limbs.\n\n\"It's like being a newborn child,\" the 33-year-old says during a break in training at a gym in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv. \"You've got to get to know the world from scratch.\"\n\nRevtiukh, who has a prosthetic leg, is one of tens of thousands of Ukrainian combat amputees who are having to adapt to a new life as civilians or back in the military.\n\nHis sister Natasha films the sparring session with leading Ukrainian boxer Aram Faniyan, to upload to her brother's social media accounts where he's trying to make his name as a motivational coach for others in his position.\n\n\"I can't be afraid to make mistakes,\" Revtiukh told Reuters. \"Look for a way out, there is a path through the thorns to the stars. This is my motto.\"\n\nRevtiukh, who left a well-paid job in Hungary in April 2022 to return to fight in Ukraine, lost his arm and leg in June last year during the summer's counteroffensive, and narrowly cheated death. He benefited from the support of his family as he underwent surgery and rehabilitation provided by the state.\n\nAs for what comes next he must make his own way, in a country where many amputees say that budget constraints, social taboos and a lack of job opportunities are making that transition more difficult.\n\nEx-soldier and lawyer Masi Nayyem, co-founder of Pryncyp, a human rights organisation representing soldiers, estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 soldiers had become amputees in Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nOfficial figures are not published and are considered sensitive by the military, but as the war drags into its third year with no end in sight, the numbers will only grow.\n\nNayyem said there were too few jobs available for the wounded, and that most initiatives to help them were in cities, leaving maimed soldiers in rural areas and small towns stranded.\n\n\"If a person is not integrated, what will they become? They will be depressed, and they will not be able to earn money.\"\n\nUkraine's Veteran Affairs Ministry, which oversees amputees, declined to give official data on the number of soldiers who had lost limbs. It did not respond to such criticism that it wasn't doing enough to support amputees once they reentered society after receiving initial hospital rehab with prosthetic limbs.\n\nRostyslav Prystupa, a former soldier partially paralysed after a piece of shrapnel hit his spine while fighting in Mariupol, said he was mindful that veterans also had to learn to support themselves in civilian life.\n\n\"When you keep doing everything for people, they won't learn to do it themselves,\" he added. \"You're not going to do everything for them their whole lives. Someday I'll have to do it myself, and then I won't be able to, and no one will be there.\"\n\nRevtiukh is close to his family, and recently visited his parents' home in Nizhyn, northeast of Kyiv. Waiting outside, his grandmother wept as she embraced Revtiukh, whom she had not seen since his arm and leg were torn off in two separate mine blasts.\n\n\"My little Sasha. I thank God that you are alive,\" she sobbed, using the diminutive of his first name.\n\nRevtiukh described how he was wounded when he triggered anti-personnel mines during chaotic fighting to seize back territory from the Russians in the southern Zaporizhzhia region.\n\nHe recalled nearly suffocating from the dirt and shrapnel in his mouth after one explosion, but a fellow soldier, a 22-year-old named Gleb who was also wounded, cleared his airways and saved his life.\n\nAs Revtiukh begins his journey into civilian life, the boxing enthusiast is, for now, trying his hand at motivational coaching and ultimately he plans to become a history teacher in his native city of Nizhyn in northern Ukraine.\n\nHe has no regrets about the path he has taken, saying he and other veterans like him would set an example for the next generation.\n\n\"They'll look to us as a model in the struggle for independence, freedom of speech and the preservation of human lives.\"",

        "text": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: , Apr 12 (PTI) The traditional vote-bases of Kerala's ruling CPI(M) and opposition Congress have \"completely collapsed\" due to the \"worst kind of appeasement politics\" pursued by these parties to win over extremist elements in the state, claims senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar.\n\nIn an interview to PTI, Javadekar, who is the BJP's Kerala in-charge, alleged that the Congress-led UDF and the CPI(M)-headed LDF were fighting the polls solely on the agenda of extremist elements, focusing on issues like CAA and Palestine instead of prioritising a development agenda.\n\nDue to this, the other sections of society, considered to be the backbone of the Left party and the Congress, are \"very much angry\" with them, he claimed.\n\n\"Kerala election has entered a very exciting phase of electioneering. I say this because many earlier equations are collapsing. Earlier, it was Muslims and Christians for the UDF while Ezhavas and other Hindus for the CPI(M). But it has completely collapsed,\" Javadekar claimed.\n\nHe said the BJP is fighting the polls solely on the development agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"The CPI(M)-led LDF and the Congress-led UDF -- both are not talking about the development of India. They are focusing on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). They are discussing Palestine. Today, secularism is Sarv Dharma Sama Bhavana, respect for all religions. But instead, they are preaching... their agenda is completely focused on competitive appeasement of extremist elements,\" he alleged.\n\nJavadekar, who has been camping in Kerala for the last several months for building the party's campaign for the Lok Sabha polls, claimed the ban imposed on the Islamist outfit Popular Front of India (PFI) by the BJP-led NDA government was welcomed by an entire section of Kerala society.\n\nAnd the Christians are now upset with the Congress after the SDPI, the political arm of PFI, extended its support to the grand old party in the Lok Sabha polls, \"and they are now coming with Narendra Modi-ji,\" he said.\n\n\"The Ezhava community is very much angry with the CPI(M) because it has started the worst kind of appeasement of extremist elements like PFI. Their whole agenda is that extremist elements' agenda. What are they talking about? They are not talking about the development of Kerala,\" Javadekar alleged.\n\nThe former union minister further said the competitive appeasement of extremist elements practiced by the CPI(M) is a real trigger for Christians also to distance themselves from the ruling party.\n\nAnd the Ezhava community and other sections, who traditionally voted for the CPI(M), are now considering voting for BJP because Modi has helped them, Javadekar said.\n\nThe former Union Information and Broadcasting Minister criticised the stand taken by the CPI(M) and the Congress on telecasting the controversial movie \"The Kerala Story\" by various Christian groups in the state, alleging these parties were intervening in the personal freedom of the people and were again merely offering \"lip service\" to extremist elements.\n\nThe Sudipto Sen-directed \"The Kerala Story\", which hit theatres last year, tells the story of a group of women from Kerala who were forced to convert to Islam and join terror outfit ISIS.\n\nJavadekar further said all sections in Kerala, particularly the Christian community, are happy with the steps taken by the Modi government like banning PFI, working against terrorism, condemning the first attack by Hamas militants on Israeli citizens and condemning terror attack in Russia.\n\nThe former union minister also claimed that the Christian community is coming closer to the BJP and will vote for the party, as \"they know that Rahul Gandhi is not going to become the prime minister and the Congress has no future.\"\n\nAsked about the violence in Manipur and the Christian community's concern over it, Javadekar said it was not a Hindu-Christian fight but a conflict between Kukkis and Meitis -- two tribal communities.\n\nHe accused the Congress and the CPI(M) of \"unleashing a misinformation campaign\" about it in Kerala.\n\nListing the benefits extended to people by the BJP government, Javadekar said, \"Modiji doesn't discriminate,\" while the LDF and the UDF choose their loyalists, favourites, and cadres for extending benefits.\n\nHe said all sections of Kerala society, including Muslims and Christians, are happy with the Modi government because of the development works undertaken by it in the state, including the introduction of Vande Bharat trains and the rapid completion of National Highways.\n\nIn reaching out to the families of expatriates, he noted that Indians living abroad are very happy because India's stature has risen in geopolitics due to PM Modi's diplomacy.\n\nHe also recalled the missions undertaken by the Modi government to rescue priests, nurses, and students stranded in conflict zones like Yemen, Iraq, and Ukraine.\n\n\"So, therefore, it is an exciting phase of the election. We are making a big impact, and people will truly understand on June 4 (the day the votes are counted),\" he said.",

Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nIf the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nFive officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military have given interviews. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"",

        "title": "Erdogan's electoral blow will shape Trkiye's foreign policy - ExBulletin",
        "text": "The recent local elections dealt a major blow to President Recep Tayyip Erdoan, marking his biggest electoral defeat to date. The loss was not just any setback; he saw the secular opposition CHP takes control of 35 cities(representing around 80% of Trkiye's GDP and more than 60% of its population), surpassing 24 for Erdoans' AK Party.\n\nThe election result raises the question of whether a seismic shift in domestic politics will alter Turkish foreign policy.\n\nThe elections were significantly influenced by the cost of living crisis.Inflation reached 68.5%and that of Trkiyehunger threshold now exceeds the weekly minimum wage of US$93. The budget deficit and the decline in foreign exchange reserves are causing new concerns. The country's economic fabric is closely linked to the West, in particular to the European Union, which remains Trkiye's main trading partner, absorbing 36% of its exports in 2023. The EU also leads foreign direct investment in Trkiye, representing 59% of investments over the last 20 years. Thus, modernizing the customs union to include services remains a priority. The election results also strengthened Mamolu, the mayor of Istanbul as a major competitorto Erdoan, making economic recovery even more crucial to maintaining his position.\n\nIn addition to continuing to promote Trkiye's economic interests, four recent developments shed light on Turkish foreign policy priorities for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe war in Ukraine underlined the geopolitical importance of Trkiye for the West. Immediately after the 2022 Russian offensive, Ankara invoked the provisions of the 1936 Montreux Convention prohibiting the passage of Russian warships through the Turkish straits.\n\nThe first is the new dynamic in relations with the United States and Egypt. The recent thaw in relations between Trkiye and the United States is highlighted by the conclusion of a deal to sell Trkiye more F-16 fighter jets and Ankara's approval of the membership of the Sweden to NATO. The completion of Erdoan's long-awaited visit to the White House in May indicated new momentum. However, the relationships betweenThe United States and the Kurdish separatist groups PKK and YPGThe Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) is classified as a terrorist organization by Western countries, including the United States, but Trkiye says the People's Protection Units (YPG), a Kurdish militant group based in Syria that attracts support from the United States, could prevent a complete reset. , is closely linked to the PKK.Trkiyes' aspirations to join the F-35 stealth aircraft program, its desire to seek relief from CAATSA Sanctionsand the ongoing controversy surrounding Trkiye's acquisition of advanced Russian air defense systemsThis also strains relations with the United States.\n\nIn February, Erdoan's first speech visit to Cairo Since 2012, this meeting with President Sissi has symbolized Trkiye's broader reconciliation efforts with the Middle East. Ankara's humanitarian role in Rafah, coupled with its potential to facilitate inter-Palestinian dialogue, brings Egypt and Trkiye closer together, despite their different stakes in the Libyan conflict and Eastern Mediterranean issues.\n\nThe second development concerns Trkiye's position on Ukraine, where she must continue her balancing act of being pro-Ukraine without positioning herself as anti-Russia.\n\nThe war in Ukraine underlined the geopolitical importance of Trkiye for the West. Immediately after the 2022 Russian offensive, Ankara invoked provisions of the Montreux Convention of 1936 banning the passage of Russian warships through the Turkish straits. Subsequently, his mediation of a grain deal between the fighters marked a diplomatic triumph. Ankara wants to maintain this role, supporting Ukraine with military equipment but refraining from aligning with Western sanctions against Russia, thereby preserving its deep trade and energy connections.\n\nThis balancing act shows how Ankara views the world, demonstrating its willingness to engage with all parties while maximizing its autonomy. Last month, Ankara hosted Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and Ukrainian President Zelensky.\n\nThird, eliminating the PKK/YPG remains a top priority for Ankara. In March, Trkiye and Iraq concluded a historic security agreement that resulted in the official ban on the PKK by Iraq. The agreement reinforces Trkiye's plan to expand a military campaign into northern Iraq aimed at establishing a 40 km security zone beyond its borders. Trkiye also aims to neutralize the PKK's influence on the advancement of the development road project, which Erdoan is promoting as an alternative to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) initiative, supported by Israel and the United Arab Emirates, which bypasses both Turkiye and Iraq.\n\nErdoan's latest priority is outreach to the South. In February, Trkiye and Somalia signed an important agreement agreement granting Trkiye control of Somalia's maritime zones for the coming decade, positioning it as a key player in the Red Sea amid growing tensions between the United States and the Houthis in Yemen and the Israeli military offensive in Palestine . Somalia forms a central part of Trkiye's growing footprint in Africa.",

        "text": "(Repeats item that first ran on Thursday. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)\n\nORLANDO, Florida, April 11 (Reuters) - Far from cementing itself as a world reserve currency, China's yuan has gone into reverse and its share of global foreign exchange reserves has fallen to the lowest level in three years.\n\nThe gradual but steady decline since early 2022 reflects the international community's unease about investing in China, which was crystallized in huge foreign capital outflows from Chinese equity and bond markets last year.\n\nWhile China's economy finally seems to be emerging from its post-lockdown funk in the wake of COVID-19, there are plenty of reasons reserve managers may still need convincing to start re-loading up on the renminbi, or yuan.\n\nChina is a global economic and financial superpower, and the yuan's role in cross-border trade and transactions is rising. But there are questions over its economic might, unease over its capital controls, and concern over its geopolitical alliances and militarism.\n\nThe yuan's allure as a global reserve currency is fading.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund's latest composition of foreign exchange reserves (Cofer) data show that of the world's $11.45 trillion in FX reserves where the currency breakdown is known, 2.29% was in renminbi at the end of last year.\n\nThat is the lowest share since the fourth quarter of 2020, and down substantially from the 2.83% peak in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nCentral banks and reserve managers around the world have reduced their yuan allocation in each of the last seven quarters. In nearly two years, the yuan share of their FX reserves has shrunk by a fifth.\n\nMichael Cahill, an FX strategist at Goldman Sachs in London, notes that Chinese government bonds no longer offer reserve managers the yield premium over developed world bonds that they did when the IMF first included the yuan in its Cofer data in 2016.\n\nAnd it's no coincidence that the Chinese currency's FX reserve footprint began to shrink in the first quarter of 2022, when Beijing's ally Russia invaded Ukraine.\n\n\"It is also certainly possible that geopolitics have played a role. Academic literature has found that reserve management is in part dictated by geopolitical alignment, and that certainly seems consistent with what we have seen,\" Cahill says.\n\nOf the 10 countries that regularly report a geographic breakdown of their reserve holdings, none have increased their yuan holdings since the first quarter of 2022.\n\nWhile these detailed reports represent only a small fraction of global reserves, Cahill reckons their stance on the yuan signals a \"notable shift\" in FX reserve management.\n\nVisibility around Russia's FX reserves dimmed after the invasion of Ukraine. But at the end of 2021 Russia was the largest holder of yuan reserves, with around a third of all internationally held yuan-denominated reserves, according to analysts at ING.\n\nThey also reckon Moscow may have reduced that stash after the invasion as it had to sell reserves to finance its ballooning budget deficit.\n\nOn the other hand, some smaller countries outside of the 149 nations included in the IMF's Cofer data set may well have increased the yuan-denominated share of their FX reserves in the last couple of years.\n\nIn short, it is hard to measure FX reserves flows with real certainty but as ING points out, the general picture is clear - the renminbi is only one of two currencies, along with the euro, whose share of global FX reserves fell over the 2022-23 two-year period.\n\nThis is an unequivocal reversal from the yuan's early days as a global reserve currency. The IMF's Cofer data show its first share of reported FX reserves at the end of 2016 was 1.08%, which nearly tripled to a peak of 2.83% in early 2022.\n\nIn nominal terms, yuan-denominated FX reserves started at $90.8 billion and reached a high of $337.3 billion in late 2021. They ended last year at $261.7 billion.\n\nThe yuan's share of reserves is falling in exchange rate-adjusted terms too, according to Goldman Sachs. They also hit a three-year low at the end of last year, although the decline has been more gradual and the previous peak was not as high.\n\nReserve managers tend to be conservative, and changes in currency allocations tend to be gradual. That's because managers tend to lean against exchange rate moves in order to keep their make up of their reserves stable - that is, they buy more of a currency when it is weakening.\n\nBut according to analysts at JP Morgan, the yuan has been the \"clearest exception\" to this rule recently. Diversification away from the yuan has continued despite the currency's 10% slide against the dollar in the 2022-23 period.\n\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)",

        "text": "NAIROBI, Kenya, Apr 12 - Senators poked holes in the government fertilizer subsidy program insisting the government is hoodwinking farmers in the guise of subsidizing production.\n\nLegislators questioned why the government subsidy was selling fertilizer at Sh2,500 since last year yet the international prices of the essential farming commodity had dropped.\n\nNyeri Senator Wahome Wamatinga emphasized that the cost of fertilizer ought to be reduced by Sh300 given the depreciating dollar in recent months.\n\n\"Given that the dollar has gone down as well as international prices why is it not possible to reduce the cost to align with government agenda on bringing the cost of living down,\" Wamatinga remarked.\n\nMandera Senator Mohammed Chute averred that there is no fertilizer subsidy in the country alluding that the current program is a ploy to enrich few cartels in the government.\n\n\"Prices of the fertilizer on the international market have gone down upto 60 percent. The dollar has gone down, do you feel the Sh 2500 is still a subsidized price,\" Chute stated.\n\nAppearing before Senate Committee on Agriculture to shed light on the claims of fake fertilizer distribution under the government subsidy program, Agriculture CS Mithika Linturi explained the fertilizer had been purchased when international prices had increased.\n\n\"if we had a luxury of more commodities in the market then we can be able to dictate.The Russia-Ukraine had disrupted supply chain which leads to time wastage,\" he said.\n\nThis comes even as farmers who bought substandard fertilizer are set to face losses as CS Linturi remained non-committal on the compensation framework of farmers despite President William Ruto's directive on the matter.\n\nCS Linturi mentioned farmers will be compensated with top dressing fertilizer at an additional fee.\n\n\"We want farmers who took the substandard fertilizer to take back the fertilizer they took then we will rework the money we haven't paid to KEL Chemicals,\"\n\n\"If we can recover that expense will all the money, we owe the company we will give them for free. If it doesn't meet then we will work a formula to see whether they will pick the fertilizer at a lower cost,\" he said.\n\nSentiments which irked Senators who demanded that farmers should be compensated with top dressing fertilizer with no additional fee as both fertilizer cost Sh 2500.\n\nThe lawmakers questioned the compensation framework if at all farmers will be forced to buy the top-dressing fertilizer from National Cereal Produce Board (NCPB) at an additional cost.\n\n\"The President was very clear that farmers should be compensated. Compensation cannot come at an extra cost. Who will benefit from this extra cost they are paying yet they were given substandard fertilizer,\" said the chair of the committee, James Murango.\n\nDetails emerged that KEL Chemicals, the firm that sold substandard fertilizer, dispatched 69,070 bags to the NCPB stores.\n\nNCPB Managing Director Joseph Kimote told senators that they sold 64,374 bags of fertilizer on behalf the firm with Sh 170 Million funds remitted to the firm within days.\n\nLinturi said his Ministry has no additional budget to compensate farmers hence they will bear the additional cost should the remaining monies owed to KEL Chemical fall short of the total compensation.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Agriculture only 3000 bags of fertilizer were substandard but a spot check by senators showed a possibility of extra bags.\n\nIn Nandi and Embu Counties alone, a total of 4,680 bags of fertilizer were substandard despite assertion by CS Linturi that only 3000 bags didn't meet the necessary parameters.\n\n\"We are not going to pay the remaining monies for KEL Chemicals until investigation are concluded. There's no cause for alarm until the investigation are done,\" the Agriculture CS said.\n\nSenators queried how substandard fertilizer was dispatched to NCPB stores with the government realizing substandard fertilizer distribution after farmers bought the farming product.\n\n\"Before we commenced the distribution, we were conceived that all the firms had met the standard. We did all due diligence, the firms had been in the market for a long period of time,\" Kimote stated.\n\nKimote stated that the Kenya Bureau of Standards (KEBS) and Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS) had ascertained KEL Chemicals had compiled with all the requirements.\n\nKimote insisted NCPB has no quality assurance mechanism only a batch of the certified fertilizer had failed the necessary requirement test saying the firm should face the blame for the erroneous mistake.\n\n\"If they are issues with the standard, it's the prerogative of the manufacturers to take into account. Our quality assurance doesn't have the capacity. We rely on other government agencies,\"",

        "text": "The ECB laid the groundwork for a June rate cut yesterday and that was basically all there was to say about it. Lagarde revealed some wanted to cut rates already and reports afterwards wrote about a handful of officials that needed extra convincing to rally behind the decision to stand pat for a little while longer. European yields erased a kneejerk move lower with markets expecting a June move for some time now. Changes in the swap curve ranged between +1.1 and 4.8 bps with a higher open accounting for most of the gains. US Treasury yields from the 5y tenor on wiped out earlier losses and moved to fresh YtD highs, adding 2.7-5.7 bps. A mediocre $22bn 30y auction with a slight tail and weaker bidding metrics had little market impact. The front end hovered sideways near the recent highs. The 2y could resist an intraday test of the 5% level after another solid reading of weekly jobless claims though. The US dollar maintained the upper hand against an overall weak euro. EUR/USD dropped to 1.0699 before paring losses to 1.0726. USD/JPY eked out another 34y-high of 153.27. Sterling licked its wounds after Wednesday's sell-off against USD. GBP/USD fights to keep the 1.25 support zone alive. EUR/GBP slipped though, with all of the steady April \"gains\" now wiped out. BoE policymaker Greene hit the wires often these past few days. She voted to keep rates steady in recent meetings and her comments suggest she'll continue to do so for some time to come. Greene said she is still far off backing rate reductions with wage growth and the risk of inflation persistence still too high. She sided with her hawkish colleagues Haskel and Mann in that markets have been too optimistic in their rates pricing. UK money markets have adjusted their thinking in recent days to just 50 bps of cuts this year though.\n\nWe'll get some more views of central bankers today and they could spark some intraday movement. Speeches by Schmid (Kansas City) and Bostic (Atlanta) are worth the attention after the recent string of stellar US data. Collins (Boston) performs as well but gave some flavour yesterday already. She noted current policy may be less restrictive than expected and less easing this year than thought earlier may be warranted. Collins is part of the neutral camp and its interesting to see this side adopts a more hawkish view. The first ECB speakers after the meeting just came in as well, with Kazaks typically pioneering. He just stated that barring surprises there will be a cut in June and said that if inflation continues to fall, the ECB can continue doing so. Turning to markets, we'll look for a technically significant weekly close in US yields above the recently conquered resistance levels (eg. 4.54% in the 10y). Some more hawkish Fed speeches could prompt another test of the 5% by the 2y but a clean break ahead of the weekend is unlikely. The dollar holds the better cards against both the euro and the pound. EUR/USD is nearing the 1.07 pivot again and GBP/USD holds close to 1.25 this morning. Which will break first?\n\nNews & Views\n\nThe Bank of Korea held its policy rate stable at 3.5% for a 10th consecutive time. Economic growth is forecast to prolong its improving trend and (core) inflation to continue its slowing trend. The latter still remains high though and there are high uncertainties regarding monetary policies in major countries, FX volatility, and geopolitics. It is premature to be confident that inflation will converge to target given this high degree of uncertainty. The Board will maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance for a \"sufficient\" period of time until such confidence is established. The previous statement referred to a \"sufficiently long\" period. BoK governor Rhee ruled out a policy rate cut in H1 2024 but added that all entire board members believe that such move can't be ruled out in H2 2024 in the case that CPI slows to 2.3% at the end of this year as forecast. KRW weakness this morning adds to USD strength earlier this week. USD/KRW surged from levels around 1350 on Wednesday to 1375 currently, the highest since November 2022.\n\nGas prices spiked by 7.5% yesterday after Russian attacks on two Ukrainian underground gas storage facilities. Russia targeted similar facilities in earlier strikes. Although still operating, it highlights potential risks for storing gas should Europe's stockpiles become full. Ukraine has more storage capacity than any other European nation. The benchmark European gas future (Dutch TTF) rose to \u20ac30/MWh, matching the highest level since early February.",

        "title": "Letter from Nikkei Asia's editor: Ready to go global",
        "text": "Hello from Tokyo. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is visiting the U.S. this week, and the cover of the latest issue of our magazine shows Kishida during an exclusive interview at the prime minister's office ahead of his trip. The cover image is the face of the publication, and our magazine team always spends a lot of time deciding on the final design.\n\nAt the suggestion of our photo editor, we decided to have the prime minister pose with a globe in his hands. Asking the head of the government to set aside time for a photo shoot was, perhaps unsurprisingly, not easy. We sent several sample photos to Kishida's office in advance so he and his staff could see what kind of images we had in mind. Fortunately, they seemed to like our idea.\n\nSpeaking of globes, one of the late Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's many catchphrases was \"diplomacy that takes a panoramic view of the world map.\" As Japan's longest-serving prime minister, Abe actively traveled abroad and, according to the prime minister's office, flew the equivalent of about 39.5 times around the world.\n\nSo how does Kishida, who served as a foreign minister under Abe, differ from his former boss in his diplomatic style? Based on our exclusive interview, this week's Big Story takes an in-depth look at the kind of Japan-U.S. relationship Kishida is seeking to build as the world tries to guess the outcome of the American presidential election in November.\n\nKishida's visit also included the first-ever trilateral summit among the U.S., Japan and the Philippines. The Philippines is Taiwan's geographically closest Southeast Asian neighbor and, like the democratically governed island, also faces rising tensions with Beijing in the South China Sea. Perhaps understandably, more Filipinos would side with the U.S. over China if asked to choose between the two powers, unlike many other countries in the region, according to a recent survey by a Singapore think tank.\n\nIf, like Abe, we take a panoramic view of the world map, we also need to look at what is happening in China this week. President Xi Jinping has been busy holding marathon talks with Vietnam's National Assembly chairman, Russia's foreign minister and Taiwan's former president. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen also recently visited China.\n\nChina was among the first countries to begin constructing a pavilion at the site of Osaka Expo 2025, and the structure is expected to be one of the largest among the participants. The U.S. is also planning a pavilion, and according to an announcement made after the U.S.-Japan summit, Washington has -- for the first time since 1988 -- approved federal funding to support the structure's design, construction and operation. But many participating nations have not so much as raised a hammer at the site yet, and our Asia Insight explains why.\n\nOne of the many reasons for the delays in preparing for the expo is the labor shortage in Japan. This is an industrywide problem, and the Business Spotlight in this week's magazine looks at the issue from perhaps a different angle than usual. The story examines the trend of large numbers of foreigners flocking to Japan to learn about auto repair, a trade that is becoming more complex as the industry shifts to electric vehicles.\n\nNot far from my office, there is a restaurant that serves a Malay dish called nasi kandar. According to my colleague who knows a lot about Malaysia, the eatery's fare is not necessarily authentic, but after reading the Tea Leaves column in this week's magazine about mamak restaurants in Malaysia, I'm confident that you will want to try the dish.",

        "title": "Russian soldiers who quit Putin's war get no hero's welcome abroad as asylum claims surge",
        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) - If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia\u00b4s war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia\u00b4s vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nA Russian officer who goes by Yevgeny speaks during an interview at his apartment in Astana, Kazakhstan, in late 2023. He had a friend shoot him in the leg so he could get out off the frontline in Ukraine. \"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\" (AP Photo)\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I\u00b4d rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia\u00b4s fault. I don\u00b4t regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group\u00b4s head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin\u00b4s group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee - a drop in the bucket compared with Russia\u00b4s overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that\u00b4s not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It\u00b4s not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it\u00b4s proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany\u00b4s Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it\u00b4s his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it\u00b4s much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country - a healthy young man who can work - than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin\u00b4s war in Ukraine.\n\nThis late 2023 photo shows downtown Astana, Kazakhstan, where some Russian soldiers who deserted the war in Ukraine live in hiding while they apply for asylum.

        "text": "An UN special rapporteur reports that Singapore has cut weapon material exports to Myanmar by 83% following his report, which noted US$254 million in transfers from 138 Singapore-based companies to Myanmar between 2021 and 2022, significantly impacting Myanmar's military capabilities.\n\nIn a report on Friday, Al Jazeera detailed Singapore's forceful response to the United Nations' scrutiny over arms sales through its territory to Myanmar. Following the 2023 findings of Thomas Andrews, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar, the city-state has significantly tightened controls on its role as a conduit for arms materials to Myanmar's military.\n\nSpeaking to the international publication, Andrews highlighted the swift and effective actions taken by Singapore, noting, \"My subsequent report to the Human Rights Council found that exports of weapons materials from Singapore to Myanmar had dropped by 83 percent. This is a significant step forward and an example of how governments can make a difference for those who are in harm's way in Myanmar.\"\n\nDespite the Singaporean Government's firm denial of involvement, Andrews's report, titled \"The Billion Dollar Death Trade,\" had earlier revealed substantial transactions totalling more than US$1 billion, with US$254 million worth of weapons materials transferred from Singapore-based companies to Myanmar from 2021 to 2022.\n\nThese companies were not specifically named in the report sections on Singapore, unlike those on China, Russia, and India. The Special Rapporteur has decided not to list the names of Singaporean entities transferring arms to the Myanmar military in order to allow time for the Singapore Government and other UN Member States to take action.\n\nIn response, the spokesperson of Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed appreciation for Andrews's efforts, stating, \"We appreciate Mr Andrews's efforts to providFe information to aid Singapore's investigations into whether any offences were committed under Singapore law.\"\n\nLast July, Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan confirmed the involvement of these entities in Parliament, noting an additional identification of 91 entities on top of an initial list of 47, all contributing to the military supply chain in Myanmar.\n\nHe further clarified that nine of these entities are no longer registered, thus unable to operate legally or conduct business in Singapore.\n\nIn September last year, two Singaporean individuals were fined a total of S$80,000 (approximately US$58,649) for their involvement in selling a sonar system that ultimately ended up with a survey centre operated by the Myanmar Navy.\n\nSingapore's decisive action has put significant pressure on Myanmar's military, particularly during a time when they are struggling to suppress a coalition of ethnic minority and majority Bamar resistance forces.\n\nThe military's woes are compounded by new conscription laws aimed at bolstering their ranks amidst battlefield losses.\n\nIn his follow-up report, Andrews mentioned, \"There was no evidence that the Singaporean government had any knowledge of the transfers that were taking place,\" indicating a significant oversight gap that Singapore has since moved to address.\n\nFurthermore, the National Unity Government (NUG) of Myanmar has lauded Singapore's efforts.\n\nNUG cabinet minister, Sasa, remarked, \"Singapore's actions have highlighted the power that ASEAN members possess to disrupt the Myanmar military junta's acts of terrorism against its own people by cutting off their access to weapons, finance, and legitimacy.\"\n\nThis news comes as the humanitarian crisis in Myanmar escalates, with over 2.5 million people displaced since the coup began in February 2021.\n\nSingapore's measures reflect a broader ASEAN divide over how to handle the crisis, with some nations advocating for engagement and others, like Singapore, taking a firmer stance against the military regime.",

He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it\u00b4s much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It\u00b4s like a woman\u00b4s handbag, there\u00b4s so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can\u00b4t find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don\u00b4t care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny\u00b4s second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn\u00b4t in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn\u00b4t want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn\u00b4t get them back to Russia and didn\u00b4t want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can\u00b4t forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn\u00b4t want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn\u00b4t want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn\u00b4t want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he\u00b4d stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They\u00b4d already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn\u00b4t walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin\u00b4s announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people\u00b4s names.\n\nHe doesn\u00b4t know what he\u00b4ll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o\u00b4clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia\u00b4s September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nWithin hours of Putin\u00b4s September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin\u00b4s phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He\u00b4d tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They\u00b4d try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin\u00b4s draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan\u00b4s largest city, where he\u00b4d been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad\u00b4s passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I\u00b4m also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky\u00b4s \"Crime and Punishment\" - into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I\u00b4d kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that\u00b4s the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren\u00b4t in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad\u00b4s lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can\u00b4t be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don\u00b4t know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad\u00b4s application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad\u00b4s application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It\u00b4s not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn\u00b4t live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he\u00b4d left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don\u00b4t know what. And without any money in my pocket. It\u00b4s very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn\u00b4t ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston\u00b4s \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn\u00b4t afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can\u00b4t fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He\u00b4s been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn\u00b4t know what to do next.\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,\u00b4\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don\u00b4t, you\u00b4ll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow\u00b4s mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn\u00b4t find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I\u00b4m not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn\u00b4t fight with the Russian armed forces, he\u00b4d end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin\u00b4s then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow\u00b4s guts couldn\u00b4t take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What\u00b4s wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he\u00b4d been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia\u00b4s criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he\u00b4d wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn\u00b4t even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow\u00b4s eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don\u00b4t want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don\u00b4t understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what\u00b4s going on in Ukraine, and that\u00b4s it.\"\n\nHe doesn\u00b4t know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn\u00b4t. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I\u00b4d rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia\u00b4s fault. I don\u00b4t regret it.\"\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn\u00b4t have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he\u00b4d fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn\u00b4t want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they\u00b4d find something easy for him to do and he\u00b4d get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He\u00b4d been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade\u00b4s chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia\u00b4s Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division\u00b4s chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it\u00b4s his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he\u00b4s hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia\u00b4s wing,\" he said. \"I can\u00b4t say it\u00b4s as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn\u00b4t have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he\u00b4d likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease - if only for a moment - with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin\u00b4s war in Ukraine.\n\nThis late 2023 photo shows downtown Astana, Kazakhstan, where some Russian soldiers who deserted the war in Ukraine live in hiding while they apply for asylum. Overall asylum claims from Russian citizens to the U.S., France and Germany have surged since Russia's full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.

        "text": "A drone view shows a truck driving along the flooded street in Zarechnoye, Russia, on Thursday. Reuters\n\nAlmost 100,000 people have been evacuated due to floods in Kazakhstan, the country's emergencies ministry said on Friday.\n\nA state of emergency remained in effect in eight out of Kazakhstan's 17 provinces, the ministry said.\n\nThe Russian city of Orenburg battled rising water levels on Thursday after major rivers across Russia and Kazakhstan burst their banks in the worst flooding seen in the areas in nearly a century.\n\nThe deluge of melt water has forced over 110,000 people from their homes in Russia's Ural Mountains, Siberia and Kazakhstan as major rivers such as the Ural, which flows through Kazakhstan into the Caspian, overwhelmed embankments.\n\nResidents in the city of Orenburg said the waters of the Ural rose swiftly and to far beyond breaking point, forcing them to flee with just their children, pets and a few belongings.\n\nPeople look at high water of the Irtysh River from a bridge, amid flooding in Kazakhstan on Thursday. Reuters\n\n\"It came very quickly at night,\" Taisiya, 71, told Reuters in Orenburg, a city of 550,000 about 1,200 km (750 miles) east of Moscow. \"By the time I got ready, I couldn't get out.\"\n\nWhole areas of the city were underwater, and the Ural rose swiftly to 10.82 metres (35 foot 6 inches), far above the level considered by local authorities as safe. Officials said the peak should be reached in Orenburg on Thursday.\n\nThe flooding has struck Russia's Urals and northern Kazakhstan worst, though waters are also rising in southern parts of Western Siberia, the largest hydrocarbon basin in the world, and in some places near the Volga, Europe's biggest river.\n\nWater levels were also rising in Siberia's Tomsk, which sits on the Tom river, a tributary of the Ob, and in Kurgan, which straddles the Tobol river.\n\nMore than 6,000 people were evacuated in the Kurgan region. The flooding of the Tobol and Ishim rivers in Russia's Tyumen region will peak by April 23-25. The Tobol and the Ishim are tributaries of the Irtysh, which along with its parent, the Ob, forms the world's seventh largest river.\n\nTwo men ride a boat as they deliver food in a flooded area in Orenburg, Russia, on Thursday. AP\n\nAfter the Ural burst through dam embankments in Orsk, upstream from Orenburg, on Friday, some residents expressed anger over how local officials had handled the situation, demanding greater compensation and begging for help from President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin would hold a meeting with Emergencies Minister Alexander Kurenkov and the governors of Orenburg, Kurgan and Tyumen, the worst affected regions. The Kremlin said Putin was devoting a significant part of his day to the floods.\n\nIn Orenburg, some residents expressed disappointment that local officials had not done enough to prepare for the annual snow melt.\n\n\"There is a lot of excitement, indignation and strong emotions that I understand and share,\" Orenburg Mayor Sergei Salmin said. \"The issue of receiving compensation and the procedure for processing payments is one of the main ones.\"",

        "text": "By Anthony Deutsch\n\nAMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A large global survey issued on Friday showed a surge in despair and disillusionment with established politics, particularly among young American men, the only U.S. population group to turn more conservative over the past decade.\n\nThe study by the international research agency Glocalities, shared with Reuters, offered context for November's U.S. presidential poll and a plethora of votes worldwide, including a European Union parliamentary election in June.\n\nIt surveyed respondents to determine their position on a scale on a scale of optimism between 'hope' and 'despair', and on another between 'control' and 'freedom' - in other words, conservatism and liberalism.\n\nOn average, the world became more liberal between 2014 and 2023, even as it became more pessimistic, according to more than 300,000 surveys in 20 countries representing nearly 60% of the global population.\n\nYoung people the world over feel especially let down by society, said Martijn Lampert, head of research at Glocalities, adding that \"the surge in despair among young adults in the U.S. far outweighs the rise in despair among young adults in EU countries\".\n\nMost strikingly, young U.S. men were the only population group in the United States or seven EU member states actually to have become more conservative since 2014 - or, in the poll's terms, to favour more control rather than freedom.\n\nIn total, 14,526 Americans were polled between 2014 and 2023, including 2,242 men aged 18-34.\n\nWorldwide, \"feelings of hopelessness, societal disillusionment and rebelling against cosmopolitan values partly explain the rise of radical right anti-establishment parties\", Lampert said, citing elections in several European countries.\n\nSocial media algorithms were magnifying the trend by drawing \"moderately conservative young men towards more extreme and radical conservative male role models and world views\".\n\nYOUNG WOMEN 'THE MOST LIBERAL GROUP IN HISTORY'\n\nThe report also highlighted a sharp difference between the world's young men and young women.\n\nBoth were worried about career prospects, financial security and education but while men aged 18-24 overtook men aged 55-70 as the most socially conservative group, women of 18-24 grew more liberal and anti-patriarchal.\n\nOn a scale where 1 represents the most conservative and 5 the most liberal, women worldwide aged 18-24 moved from 3.55 in 2014 to 3.78 in 2023 - both easily the highest for any age group.\n\nMen of the same age moved from 3.29 to 3.36. And in the U.S., men of 18-34 became less liberal, dropping from 3.48 to 3.46.\n\n\"Globally young women are likely the most liberal group in human history,\" the report said.\n\nYoung women were worried above all about social issues such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, child abuse and neglect.\n\nYoung men were more geared towards achieving social and economic status, and set store by conservative family values and competition, bravery and honour.\n\nIf the report offered a glimmer of optimism, it was among the world's men and women over 55, the only groups to become generally more hopeful over the decade, as well as more liberal.\n\nRespondents were asked 43 questions to assess where they ranked.\n\nTo gauge social values, Glocalities assessed their views about patriarchy, gender role flexibility, same-sex marriage and cohabitation before marriage.\n\nThe measurement of sentiment focused on future prospects and feelings about being let down by society.\n\nSurveys were conducted in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Britain and the U.S.\n\n(Reporting by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Kevin Liffey)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

        "title": "Russian soldiers who quit Putin's war get no hero's welcome abroad as asylum claims surge",
        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana.

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "Washington, DC [US], April 12 (ANI): The United States' defence commitments to Japan and the Philippines are \"ironclad,\" US President Joe Biden said on Thursday as he hosted the first-ever trilateral summit between the three countries, welcoming Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr to the White House a day after the official visit of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, CNN reported.\n\nThe US-Japan-Philippines trilateral comes after the creation of groupings in the Indo-Pacific, starting with the Quad, comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan, and the AUKUS, consisting of Australia, the US and the UK, amid increasing concerns over China's military muscle-flexing in the region.\n\n\"When we stand as one, we're able to forge a better future for all,\" Biden said in the East Room of the White House Thursday.\n\nAccording to CNN, tensions between the Philippines and China have been focused on the Second Thomas Shoal, situated approximately 200 kilometres off the coast of Palawan, Philippines. In the 1990s, the Philippines intentionally grounded an aging World War II-era navy transport ship on the shoal to reinforce its territorial claim.

These concerns have prompted regional allies to draw closer to the US.\n\nJapan has emerged as a focal point in President Biden's efforts to strengthen alliances in the Indo-Pacific. Prime Minister Kishida has been viewed as a cooperative partner, having made significant adjustments to Japan's defence strategy in recent years. Additionally, Japan has provided ongoing support to Ukraine in the wake of Russia's invasion, demonstrating its commitment to international security. Kishida has pledged to increase defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP by 2037 and has bolstered Japan's counterstrike capabilities by acquiring American Tomahawk missiles.\n\nBiden hosted Marcos at the White House last year, showing his intent to reestablish strong ties with Manila that had frayed under former President Rodrigo Duterte, who sought closer relations with China.\n\n\"We're going to continue to support the Philippines military's modernization goals,\" Biden told the visiting leader during that visit, pledging the two nations \"not only share a strong partnership, we share a deep friendship, one that has been enriched by millions of Filipino Americans in the communities all across the United States.\"A highlight of Thursday's meeting was several announcements meant to bolster the Philippines.\n\nA senior administration official also said that on Thursday, the White House will be announcing a new infrastructure project in the Philippines. CNN reported earlier this week that one of the announcements will be the development of a new rail and shipping corridor between the Philippines's Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base, a move that's meant to send a clear message to Beijing.\n\nBiden briefly referenced that economic corridor on Thursday: \"It means more jobs for people across the entire region,\" he said. \"It means more investment in sectors critical to our future: clean energy, ports, railroads, agriculture and much more.\"The White House is also expected to increase the Filipino military's capability with a new infrastructure investment similar to what the US announced in India in the lead-up to the G20.\n\nIn the days leading up to the summit, the US, Japan and the Philippines along with Australia, conducted maritime military exercises near the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), after Philippine vessels had alleged \"harassment\" by Chinese ships in the South China Sea.\n\nThe senior official added that the White House will also be making announcements about \"Open Radio Access Network technology\" and that both the US and Japan will be providing millions of dollars in funding.\n\nOfficials also said they will announce an upcoming Coast Guard patrol in the Indo-Pacific that will take place \"in the coming year.\" (ANI)",

        "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A large global survey issued on Friday showed a surge in despair and disillusionment with established politics, particularly among young American men, the only U.S. population group to turn more conservative over the past decade.\n\nThe study by the international research agency Glocalities, shared with Reuters, offered context for November's U.S. presidential poll and a plethora of votes worldwide, including a European Union parliamentary election in June.\n\nIt surveyed respondents to determine their position on a scale on a scale of optimism between 'hope' and 'despair', and on another between 'control' and 'freedom' - in other words, conservatism and liberalism.\n\nOn average, the world became more liberal between 2014 and 2023, even as it became more pessimistic, according to more than 300,000 surveys in 20 countries representing nearly 60% of the global population.\n\nYoung people the world over feel especially let down by society, said Martijn Lampert, head of research at Glocalities, adding that \"the surge in despair among young adults in the U.S. far outweighs the rise in despair among young adults in EU countries\".\n\nMost strikingly, young U.S. men were the only population group in the United States or seven EU member states actually to have become more conservative since 2014 - or, in the poll's terms, to favour more control rather than freedom.\n\nIn total, 14,526 Americans were polled between 2014 and 2023, including 2,242 men aged 18-34.\n\nWorldwide, \"feelings of hopelessness, societal disillusionment and rebelling against cosmopolitan values partly explain the rise of radical right anti-establishment parties\", Lampert said, citing elections in several European countries.\n\nSocial media algorithms were magnifying the trend by drawing \"moderately conservative young men towards more extreme and radical conservative male role models and world views\".\n\nYOUNG WOMEN 'THE MOST LIBERAL GROUP IN HISTORY'\n\nThe report also highlighted a sharp difference between the world's young men and young women.\n\nBoth were worried about career prospects, financial security and education but while men aged 18-24 overtook men aged 55-70 as the most socially conservative group, women of 18-24 grew more liberal and anti-patriarchal.\n\nOn a scale where 1 represents the most conservative and 5 the most liberal, women worldwide aged 18-24 moved from 3.55 in 2014 to 3.78 in 2023 - both easily the highest for any age group.\n\nMen of the same age moved from 3.29 to 3.36. And in the U.S., men of 18-34 became less liberal, dropping from 3.48 to 3.46.\n\n\"Globally young women are likely the most liberal group in human history,\" the report said.\n\nYoung women were worried above all about social issues such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, child abuse and neglect.\n\nYoung men were more geared towards achieving social and economic status, and set store by conservative family values and competition, bravery and honour.\n\nIf the report offered a glimmer of optimism, it was among the world's men and women over 55, the only groups to become generally more hopeful over the decade, as well as more liberal.\n\nRespondents were asked 43 questions to assess where they ranked.\n\nTo gauge social values, Glocalities assessed their views about patriarchy, gender role flexibility, same-sex marriage and cohabitation before marriage.\n\nThe measurement of sentiment focused on future prospects and feelings about being let down by society.\n\nSurveys were conducted in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Britain and the U.S.\n\n(Reporting by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",

        "text": "A screenshot shared on X yesterday, by Kuda Musasiwa, a popular Zimbabwean on the platform suggested that Starlink has started disconnecting Zimbabweans.\n\nThe screenshot, an email supposedly from Starlink, was shared with the caption:\n\nLocal \"Authorities\" have instructed us to disable your service.\n\nkwachu!! Ironically this means that even ZBCs and Ministers starlinks will now be disabled.\n\nKwachustan is a Crime Scene\n\nThe email itself reads:\n\n\"You are currently using Starlink in an unauthorized territory. Local telecommunication authorities have instructed Starlink to disable your services.\n\nAs described in your Terms of Service, Starlink does not guarantee when or where its Mobile or Mobile Priority Services Plans will be available. Use of such services is dependent on many factors, including obtaining or maintaining the necessary regulatory approvals which are subject to change. We regret any inconvenience this may cause you\", reads part of the message.\n\nYou may pause service and billing by following the instructions here or continue service and use your Starlink service in an area we currently serve (see map here). If you opt to pause service, you can reach out to support and we will issue a service credit for any remainder of the current billing period.\"\n\nTechzim has since determined this claim is false. A Starlink black market dealer in Zimbabwe has told us users are not at all receiving such emails from SpaceX.\n\nThe dealer, who prefers anonymity given his business, also said this particular screenshot has been making the rounds for at least 2 weeks and, until yesterday at least, the claim was that the email was received by Starlink users in DRC. \"It's the same screenshot doing the rounds.\" he said.\n\nIt's \"Yes\" and \"Not enough\" depending on who you ask.\n\nIn February, reports suggested Starlink equipment belonging to hundreds of customers had been deactivated. The kits would have been smuggled from a country like Zambia, Mozambique and Eswatini where Starlink is licensed and operating. So it is happening outside Zimbabwe for now.\n\nPeople that don't want other people using Starlink are complaining the company isn't doing enough to prevent and stop 'illegal use'. Take this Bloomberg article for example that calls the situation a \"systemic global problem\":\n\nHow they are smuggled and the sheer availability of Starlink on the black market suggests that its misuse is a systemic global problem, raising questions about the company's control of a system with clear national security dimensions.\n\nJust to be clear, the context of the Bloomberg article is Russia and the war in Ukraine. In response to questions about Russia's use of Starlink kits, the company said in February:\n\nIf SpaceX obtains knowledge that a Starlink terminal is being used by a sanctioned or unauthorized party, we investigate the claim and take actions to deactivate the terminal if confirmed.\n\nThe Starlink seller Techzim spoke to was actually worried that tweets like Kuda's (which has since been deleted) and articles like this one, will give Zimbabwe's telecoms regulator POTRAZ ideas.\n\nBut as pointed out in our article last month:\n\nStarlink cannot just pull the plug on all the kits in countries where their service is not yet approved. That's because part of their service offering is the roaming service.\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg article referenced earlier, there's a workaround Starlink users and dealers have resorted to. Apparently, the terminal can be re-registered in a different country and reactivated, then you roam with it again.\n\nIn Africa, Starlink is licensed in Mozambique, Malawi, Zambia, Eswatini, Rwanda, Kenya, Nigeria and Benin.",

The dueling military and diplomatic maneuvers are meant to strengthen the partners' solidarity in the face of China's aggressive military actions in the region.\n\nA number of US and South Korean guided missile destroyers and a Japanese warship joined the April 10-12 drill in the disputed East China Sea, where worries about China territorial claims are rising. The Associated Press was one of several news organizations allowed a front-row look at the drills.\n\nRear Adm. Christopher Alexander, commander of Carrier Strike Group Nine, said the three nations conducted undersea warfare exercises, maritime interdiction operations, search and rescue drills and work focused on communication and data sharing. He told journalists Thursday on the Roosevelt that these drills would help improve communication among the United States and its allies and \"better prepare us for a crisis in the region.\"\n\nF/A-18E Super Hornet combat jets took off from the carrier's flight deck, which also had anti-submarine MH-60R Seahawk helicopters. Journalists were flown more than an hour from Kadena Air Base, the hub of US Pacific air power. Kadena is on Japan's southern island of Okinawa, which is home to about half of the 50,000 American troops stationed in Japan.\n\n\"It is a busy time; there is a lot going on in the world,\" Alexander said. \"The significance of this exercise is we have three like-minded countries, three like-minded navies that believe in peace, security and stability in the western Pacific.\"\n\nThe participation of Japan and South Korea was another sign of improving ties between the sometimes wary neighbors. The two US allies' relationship has often been strained by the memory of Japan's half-century colonization of the Korean Peninsula. Washington has been pressing them to cooperate so the three partners can better deal with threats from China and North Korea.\n\nThis week's huge parliamentary election defeat of the governing party of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has sought better relations with Japan, could constrain his Japan-friendly efforts, but experts believe ties will remain stable.\n\nThe latest naval exercise is part of Biden's work to deepen security and diplomatic engagement with Indo-Pacific nations. Biden invited Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos to the White House for their first trilateral talks Thursday, and has declared that the US defense commitment to the Pacific allies is \"ironclad.\"\n\nTensions between China and the Philippines have risen over repeated clashes by the two nations' coast guard vessels in the disputed South China Sea. Chinese coast guard ships also regularly approach disputed Japanese-controlled East China Sea islands near Taiwan.\n\nBeijing has defended its operations in the South China Sea and blamed the United States for creating tensions. China's President Xi Jinping had a series of talks this week with senior officials from Vietnam, Russia and Taiwan.\n\nThe US-Japan-South Korea naval exercises follow four-way drills held in the South China Sea, where Japan joined the United States, Australia and the Philippines. Participants carefully avoided mentioning China and said they were holding the exercises to safeguard a peaceful and stable Indo-Pacific.\n\nAn area of long-simmering disputes, the South China Sea serves a key sea lane for global trade. Concerned governments include Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Taiwan.",

        "text": "\"All European countries are arming themselves, and we must do the same,\" President Aleksandar Vucic said in March.\n\n\"Even much more than the others, to stay intact and be able to dissuade possible aggressors,\" he said.\n\nSerbia has continued to purchase weapons from China and Russia after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.\n\nIn February, the Serbian president proudly presented his latest acquisitions, Russia's Repellent anti-drone system as well as Chinese drones.\n\nHe said Serbia would start producing its own explosive drones by the end of the year.\n\n\"Serbia acquires weapons and military equipment both from the East and the West,\" the country's defence ministry told AFP in March, responding to a question about its purchases.\n\nBelgrade is \"opting for those whose characteristics will improve the capabilities of the Serbian armed forces\", it said.\n\nSerbia's annual military budget has tripled in the past decade to reach 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion).\n\nThe amount exceeds the combined budgets of the other five Western Balkan nations -- Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Macedonia and Montenegro.\n\nFrom 2014 until this year, Serbia spent 2.7 billion euros ($2.9 billion) on arms purchases. They included the 2019 acquisition of China's FK-3 air-defence system as well as Russian Mi-17 and Mi-35 helicopters and Pantsir anti-aircraft systems.\n\nIn February, Vucic hinted that Serbia was ready to invest three billion euros for a possible purchase of French Rafale planes.\n\nDuring a visit to Paris earlier this week he went even further.\n\n\"I believe we have reached concrete agreements concerning the purchase of Rafales,\" he said.\n\n\"I expect the contract to be signed within the next two months, in the presence of the French president, which is extremely important for our country.\"\n\nDassault Aviation, which makes the planes, refused to comment Monday on a possible sale of its jets to Serbia.\n\nThe sale would raise questions, given Vucic's closeness to Russia.\n\n\"It would be ridiculous for Paris, on the one hand, to mention sending troops to Ukraine, and on the other, to sell an extremely sophisticated weapon to one of Russia's closest allies\", political scientist Jasmin Mujanovic said.\n\nSince Russia's aggression on Ukraine in February 2022, Belgrade has not joined any sanctions against Russia.\n\nSerbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic visited Moscow in late March, an opportunity, according to Belgrade, to improve the \"traditionally friendly ties between Serbia and Russia\".\n\nThe sale of Rafales to a Russian ally \"would be worrying, as it would allow information to leak to China and Russia\", Mujanovic told AFP.\n\nThe fighter jet, which has been operational since 2004 and is scheduled to fly until 2060s, is the French defence industry's export spearhead.\n\nSeven countries -- Egypt, Qatar, India, Greece, Indonesia, the United Arab Emirates and Croatia -- either fly Rafales or have signed deals to acquire them.\n\nAccording to the Serbian defence white paper published last year, the \"biggest security challenge\" for the country is Kosovo, its former province that proclaimed independence in 2008, a decade after a war that claimed 13,000 lives.\n\nIf the Rafale deal goes ahead \"you could see French fighter jets used to intimidate Kosovo,\" Mujanovic said.\n\nElsewhere in Serbia's neighbourhood, Albania inaugurated a NATO-backed airbase in March, while Croatia bought 12 used Rafale planes and is considering reintroducing compulsory military service. Both Albania and Croatia are NATO members.\n\nKosovo meanwhile has announced a $75 million deal for US Javelin anti-tank missiles.\n\nAdnan Cerimagic, a researcher with the European Stability Initiative (ESI) think-tank, pointed to the \"European, even global, trend towards increasing military capacities\" and the \"dominant narrative in Serbia, which speaks of the duty to prepare for conflict\".\n\n\"Difficult days lie ahead for Serbia,\" Vucic wrote in a viral Instagram post on March 26, citing \"news that directly threatens our vital national interests\", without elaborating.\n\n\"It will be difficult. We will fight. Serbia will win,\" the president wrote.",

        "title": "Russian soldiers who quit Putin's war get no hero's welcome abroad as asylum claims surge",
        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "text": "A large global survey issued on Friday showed a surge in despair and disillusionment with established politics, particularly among young American men, the only U.S. population group to turn more conservative over the past decade.\n\nThe study by the international research agency Glocalities, shared with Reuters, offered context for November's U.S. presidential poll and a plethora of votes worldwide, including a European Union parliamentary election in June.\n\nIt surveyed respondents to determine their position on a scale on a scale of optimism between 'hope' and 'despair', and on another between 'control' and 'freedom' - in other words, conservatism and liberalism.\n\nOn average, the world became more liberal between 2014 and 2023, even as it became more pessimistic, according to more than 300,000 surveys in 20 countries representing nearly 60% of the global population.\n\nYoung people the world over feel especially let down by society, said Martijn Lampert, head of research at Glocalities, adding that \"the surge in despair among young adults in the U.S. far outweighs the rise in despair among young adults in EU countries\".\n\nMost strikingly, young U.S. men were the only population group in the United States or seven EU member states actually to have become more conservative since 2014 - or, in the poll's terms, to favour more control rather than freedom.\n\nIn total, 14,526 Americans were polled between 2014 and 2023, including 2,242 men aged 18-34.\n\nWorldwide, \"feelings of hopelessness, societal disillusionment and rebelling against cosmopolitan values partly explain the rise of radical right anti-establishment parties\", Lampert said, citing elections in several European countries.\n\nSocial media algorithms were magnifying the trend by drawing \"moderately conservative young men towards more extreme and radical conservative male role models and world views\".\n\nYOUNG WOMEN 'THE MOST LIBERAL GROUP IN HISTORY'\n\nThe report also highlighted a sharp difference between the world's young men and young women.\n\nBoth were worried about career prospects, financial security and education but while men aged 18-24 overtook men aged 55-70 as the most socially conservative group, women of 18-24 grew more liberal and anti-patriarchal.\n\nOn a scale where 1 represents the most conservative and 5 the most liberal, women worldwide aged 18-24 moved from 3.55 in 2014 to 3.78 in 2023 - both easily the highest for any age group.\n\nMen of the same age moved from 3.29 to 3.36. And in the U.S., men of 18-34 became less liberal, dropping from 3.48 to 3.46.\n\n\"Globally young women are likely the most liberal group in human history,\" the report said.\n\nYoung women were worried above all about social issues such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, child abuse and neglect.\n\nYoung men were more geared towards achieving social and economic status, and set store by conservative family values and competition, bravery and honour.\n\nIf the report offered a glimmer of optimism, it was among the world's men and women over 55, the only groups to become generally more hopeful over the decade, as well as more liberal.\n\nRespondents were asked 43 questions to assess where they ranked.\n\nTo gauge social values, Glocalities assessed their views about patriarchy, gender role flexibility, same-sex marriage and cohabitation before marriage.\n\nThe measurement of sentiment focused on future prospects and feelings about being let down by society.\n\nSurveys were conducted in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Britain and the U.S.",

        "text": "The Russian city of Orenburg battled rising water levels on Thursday after major rivers across Russia and Kazakhstan burst their banks in the worst flooding seen in the areas in nearly a century.\n\nThe deluge of meltwater has forced over 110,000 people from their homes in Russia's Ural Mountains, Siberia and Kazakhstan as major rivers such as the Ural, which flows through Kazakhstan into the Caspian, overwhelmed embankments, Reuters reported.\n\nResidents in the city of Orenburg said the waters of the Ural rose very swiftly and to far beyond breaking point, forcing them to flee with just their children, pets and a few belongings.\n\n\"It came very quickly at night,\" Taisiya, 71, told Reuters in Orenburg, a city of 550,000 about 1,200 km (750 miles) east of Moscow. \"By the time I got ready, I couldn't get out.\"\n\nWhole areas of the city were underwater, and the Ural rose another 32 cm (13 inches) to 10.54 meters (34.6 ft), 124 cm (49 inches) above the level considered by local authorities as safe. Officials warned the river would rise further.\n\nThe flooding has struck Russia's Urals and the northern Kazakhstan worst, though waters are also rising southern parts of Western Siberia, the largest hydrocarbon basin in the world, and in some places near the Volga, Europe's biggest river.\n\nWater levels were also rising in Siberia's Tomsk, which sits on the Tom River, a tributary of the Ob, and in Kurgan, which straddles the Tobol river.\n\nAfter the Ural burst through dam embankments in Orsk, upstream from Orenburg, on Friday, some residents expressed anger over how local officials had handled the situation, demanding greater compensation and begging for help from President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin was being updated regularly on the situation but had no current plans to visit the area while emergency services tried to deal with rising waters.\n\nIn Orenburg, some residents expressed disappointment that local officials had not done enough to prepare for the annual snow melt.\n\n\"There is a lot of excitement, indignation and strong emotions that I understand and share,\" Orenburg Mayor Sergei Salmin said. \"The issue of receiving compensation and the procedure for processing payments is one of the main ones.\"\n\nSNOW MELT\n\nSpring flooding is a usual part of life across Russia - which has an area equal to the United States and Australia combined - as the heavy winter snows melt, swelling some of mighty rivers of Russia and Central Asia.\n\nThis year, though, a combination of factors triggered unusually severe flooding, according to emergency workers.\n\nThey said soils were waterlogged before winter and then was frozen under deep snow falls which melted very fast in rising spring temperatures and heavy rains.\n\nClimate researchers have long warned that rising temperatures could increase the incidence of extreme weather events, and that heavily forested Russia is of major importance in the global climate equation.\n\nIn Kurgan, a region which straddles the Tobol river, water levels rose in Zverinogolovkoye beyond the critical 10 meter (33 foot) mark, said Governor Vadim Shumkov who was shown visiting evacuated families.\n\nKazakhstan has been badly hit.\n\nThe emergencies ministry said on Thursday morning that the number of evacuees stood at over 97,000, unchanged from Wednesday, and a state of emergency remained in effect in eight regions of the country.\n\nEmergency workers have removed 8.8 million cubic meters (310 million cubic feet) of water from flooded areas, the ministry said. The Kazakh government also said movement was restricted on hundreds of kilometers of roads in the Aktobe, Akmola, Atyrau, Kostanai, Mangistau and North Kazakhstan regions.",

        "title": "Russian soldiers who quit Putin's war get no hero's welcome abroad as asylum claims surge",
        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military.

We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests.

He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "\"Households' inflation expectations tend to be overlooked in the monetary policy analysis, as they are often higher than measured inflation. However, new research shows that households' inflation expectations are important. Households' expectations affect consumption, investment and saving, factors that are important both for inflation and the transmission of monetary policy and therefore matter for monetary policy both in the short and longer term\", Breman explains.\n\nResearch in behavioural economics highlights the tendency of households to attach more importance to rising prices than to falling ones, and of their perception of inflation being more affected by prices of goods they frequently buy, such as energy and food, than by other prices. These prices rose particularly rapidly after the pandemic and Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine. Behavioural economics research also emphasises that households' perception of fairness can influence companies' pricing. Households seem to be more willing to accept price increases caused by higher costs than higher demand. This may have allowed companies to increase their consumer prices more in recent years, further fuelling inflation.\n\nThe research also indicates that dramatic events such as the rapid and sharp rise in inflation in recent years can affect people's economic decisions over a long period of time.\n\n\"Now that an entire generation has experienced a period of high inflation for the first time, will households and businesses act differently in the future?\" Breman asks.\n\nThere is also a risk that inflation peaks will become more frequent, in which case household perceptions may have an even greater impact.\n\n\"It is positive that inflation has fallen from high levels and that the inflation outlook is favourable. At our last monetary policy meeting in March, my assessment was that the policy rate could probably be cut in May or June. However, a smooth return to sustainably low and stable inflation should not be taken for granted. Monetary policy therefore needs to be characterised by a learning approach, with preparedness to adjust the policy rate as we gradually work out which rate level is compatible with sustainably low and stable inflation.\n\n\"With new research on how households perceive inflation and form their inflation expectations, we can better understand and address the challenges facing monetary policy in a turbulent world,\" she concludes.",

        "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A large global survey issued on Friday showed a surge in despair and disillusionment with established politics, particularly among young American men, the only U.S. population group to turn more conservative over the past decade.\n\nThe study by the international research agency Glocalities, shared with Reuters, offered context for November's U.S. presidential poll and a plethora of votes worldwide, including a European Union parliamentary election in June.\n\nIt surveyed respondents to determine their position on a scale on a scale of optimism between 'hope' and 'despair', and on another between 'control' and 'freedom' - in other words, conservatism and liberalism.\n\nOn average, the world became more liberal between 2014 and 2023, even as it became more pessimistic, according to more than 300,000 surveys in 20 countries representing nearly 60% of the global population.\n\nYoung people the world over feel especially let down by society, said Martijn Lampert, head of research at Glocalities, adding that \"the surge in despair among young adults in the U.S. far outweighs the rise in despair among young adults in EU countries\".\n\nMost strikingly, young U.S. men were the only population group in the United States or seven EU member states actually to have become more conservative since 2014 - or, in the poll's terms, to favour more control rather than freedom.\n\nIn total, 14,526 Americans were polled between 2014 and 2023, including 2,242 men aged 18-34.\n\nWorldwide, \"feelings of hopelessness, societal disillusionment and rebelling against cosmopolitan values partly explain the rise of radical right anti-establishment parties\", Lampert said, citing elections in several European countries.\n\nSocial media algorithms were magnifying the trend by drawing \"moderately conservative young men towards more extreme and radical conservative male role models and world views\".\n\nYOUNG WOMEN 'THE MOST LIBERAL GROUP IN HISTORY'\n\nThe report also highlighted a sharp difference between the world's young men and young women.\n\nBoth were worried about career prospects, financial security and education but while men aged 18-24 overtook men aged 55-70 as the most socially conservative group, women of 18-24 grew more liberal and anti-patriarchal.\n\nOn a scale where 1 represents the most conservative and 5 the most liberal, women worldwide aged 18-24 moved from 3.55 in 2014 to 3.78 in 2023 - both easily the highest for any age group.\n\nMen of the same age moved from 3.29 to 3.36. And in the U.S., men of 18-34 became less liberal, dropping from 3.48 to 3.46.\n\n\"Globally young women are likely the most liberal group in human history,\" the report said.\n\nYoung women were worried above all about social issues such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, child abuse and neglect.\n\nYoung men were more geared towards achieving social and economic status, and set store by conservative family values and competition, bravery and honour.\n\nIf the report offered a glimmer of optimism, it was among the world's men and women over 55, the only groups to become generally more hopeful over the decade, as well as more liberal.\n\nRespondents were asked 43 questions to assess where they ranked.\n\nTo gauge social values, Glocalities assessed their views about patriarchy, gender role flexibility, same-sex marriage and cohabitation before marriage.\n\nThe measurement of sentiment focused on future prospects and feelings about being let down by society.\n\nSurveys were conducted in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Britain and the U.S.",

        "text": "Throughout the trial, Simpson's legal team became a regular presence on television and on newsstands.\n\nNew Delhi:\n\nFormer American football player and actor O.J. Simpson lived a life filled with glory on the field but overshadowed by infamy off it, his family has announced. He died Thursday of prostate cancer, his family announced. While his accomplishments in sports and entertainment were notable, it was the courtroom drama that took place in the mid-1990s that left its mark on American culture and justice.\n\nSimpson was involved in what became known as the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, outside their Los Angeles home in June 1994. The \"Trial of the Century\" event. The ensuing investigation led to the incident being uncovered. Simpson became the center of attention as the prime suspect.\n\nThe events that followed, including Simpson's attempt to evade law enforcement during a televised car chase and subsequent arrest, drew unprecedented national attention. The ensuing murder trial began in January 1995, with the prosecution's case pitted against Simpson's defense and racial tensions simmering beneath the surface.\n\ntry out\n\nThroughout the trial, Simpson's legal team became a regular presence on television and on newsstands. The famous \"Dream Team\" consisting of F Lee Bailey, Robert Blasier, Johnnie Cochran, Alan Dershowitz, Shawn Chapman Holley, Robert Kardashian and Robert Shapiro changed the public's perception of the criminal justice system and unexpectedly influenced reality television.\n\nThe media scrutinizes every detail, turning court proceedings into a spectacle watched by millions. Prosecutors argued Simpson was guilty and presented evidence linking him to the crime scene, while the defense countered by citing police misconduct and racial bias.\n\nSee also Putin says Russia is on the verge of developing breakthrough cancer vaccine\n\nThe trial climaxed in a crucial moment when Simpson struggled to put on the gloves believed to be worn by his killer. The iconic scene in which Simpson's hands failed to fill the gloves became a rallying cry for his defense team. These gloves remain a symbol of enduring drama in the courtroom.\n\nbloody gloves\n\nThe saga of the blood-stained glove begins with discoveries in separate locations: one outside Brown's residence and another on Simpson's own estate.\n\nHowever, when the moment of truth arrived and Simpson tried to put on the gloves, the scene unfolded dramatically. The gloves don't fit properly. This unique moment gave birth to Johnny Cochran's iconic line: \"If it doesn't fit, you must acquit.\"\n\nA dramatic scene unfolded in court as Simpson apparently struggled to fit the gloves onto the thinner latex gloves he had been given. The performance led jurors to question whether the gloves really belonged to him. The incident, which took place on June 15, 1995, became one of the defining moments of the trial, with observers later noting that Simpson, who had appeared in movies, brought his acting skills to bear in the courtroom.\n\nImage source: AFP\n\nThe prosecution countered. They said the gloves shrank from exposure to blood. However, doubts remain.\n\nIn October 1995, the jury returned the verdict: not guilty. Simpson's acquittal has divided America along racial lines and sparked debate about the fairness of the justice system and the role of celebrities in legal proceedings.\n\nSimpson's legal troubles did not end with his acquittal, however. In 2007, he faced armed robbery and kidnapping charges following a confrontation in a Las Vegas hotel room. Simpson was convicted and imprisoned, serving nine years before being released in 2017.\n\nSee also Biden reiterates need for release of US journalists jailed in Russia",

        "text": "It surveyed respondents to determine their position on a scale on a scale of optimism between 'hope' and 'despair', and on another between 'control' and 'freedom' - in other words, conservatism and liberalism.\n\nOn average, the world became more liberal between 2014 and 2023, even as it became more pessimistic, according to more than 300,000 surveys in 20 countries representing nearly 60% of the global population.\n\nYoung people the world over feel especially let down by society, said Martijn Lampert, head of research at Glocalities, adding that \"the surge in despair among young adults in the U.S. far outweighs the rise in despair among young adults in EU countries\".\n\nMost strikingly, young U.S. men were the only population group in the United States or seven EU member states actually to have become more conservative since 2014 - or, in the poll's terms, to favour more control rather than freedom.\n\nIn total, 14,526 Americans were polled between 2014 and 2023, including 2,242 men aged 18-34.\n\nWorldwide, \"feelings of hopelessness, societal disillusionment and rebelling against cosmopolitan values partly explain the rise of radical right anti-establishment parties\", Lampert said, citing elections in several European countries.\n\nSocial media algorithms were magnifying the trend by drawing \"moderately conservative young men towards more extreme and radical conservative male role models and world views\".\n\nThe report also highlighted a sharp difference between the world's young men and young women.\n\nBoth were worried about career prospects, financial security and education but while men aged 18-24 overtook men aged 55-70 as the most socially conservative group, women of 18-24 grew more liberal and anti-patriarchal.\n\nOn a scale where 1 represents the most conservative and 5 the most liberal, women worldwide aged 18-24 moved from 3.55 in 2014 to 3.78 in 2023 - both easily the highest for any age group.\n\nMen of the same age moved from 3.29 to 3.36. And in the U.S., men of 18-34 became less liberal, dropping from 3.48 to 3.46.\n\n\"Globally young women are likely the most liberal group in human history,\" the report said.\n\nYoung women were worried above all about social issues such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, child abuse and neglect.\n\nYoung men were more geared towards achieving social and economic status, and set store by conservative family values and competition, bravery and honour.\n\nIf the report offered a glimmer of optimism, it was among the world's men and women over 55, the only groups to become generally more hopeful over the decade, as well as more liberal.\n\nRespondents were asked 43 questions to assess where they ranked.\n\nTo gauge social values, Glocalities assessed their views about patriarchy, gender role flexibility, same-sex marriage and cohabitation before marriage.\n\nThe measurement of sentiment focused on future prospects and feelings about being let down by society.\n\nSurveys were conducted in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Britain and the U.S.\n\n(Reporting by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\u00d7\n\nAlready a Subscriber?

I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming.

No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace.

        "title": "Paper Straw Market Latest Innovations and Technological Advancements, Impact on Future Growth (2024-2032) | Taiwan News | Apr. 12, 2024 06:17",
        "text": "According to a new market research report published by Report Ocean, the global Paper Straw Market is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of $%, during the forecast period. The market is estimated to reach $$ billion by 2031.\n\nThis detailed market research report by Report Ocean include in-depth analysis of technological innovations, market trends, supply chain trends, future trends, leading players, and key developments. The report also includes additional information about other factors such as drivers, restraints and challenges faced by this market, along with an overview for each mentioned segment in the study.\n\nRequest To Download Sample of This Strategic Report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bwcc17927\n\nThe global paper straw market revenue was around US$ 865.3 million in 2021 and is estimated to reach US$ 3016.2 million by 2031, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.3% during the forecast period from 2022 to 2031.\n\nPaper straw is a small, flexible tube used to suck liquid into the mouth that is made of waterproof paper. Several thin paper reels are passed through a glue bath during the production of paper straws. Then, a lengthy paper cylinder is formed by winding together these tacky reels. After being trimmed to size, the lengthy cylinder tubes are subsequently packaged and transported.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau reports that the goods and services deficit rose from $68.7 billion in January 2023 to $70.5 billion in February, an increase of $1.9 billion. Due to a $2.7 billion increase in the goods deficit to $93.0 billion and a $0.8 billion increase in the services surplus to $22.4 billion, the goods and services deficit increased in February. The goods and services deficit has decreased this year by $35.5 billion, or 20.3% when compared to the same period in 2022. $10.8% more, or $49.5 billion, was exported. Imports cost $2.2% more, or $14.0 billion, than exports.\n\nFactors Influencing Market Growth\n\nThe market growth of alternative straws, such as paper straws, is influenced by several key factors. One of the primary drivers is government initiatives to reduce plastic usage and the implementation of severe regulatory restrictions on conventional plastic utensils. These measures aim to curb plastic pollution and promote more sustainable alternatives. As a result, the demand for alternative straws, including paper straws, is expected to increase, driving market growth.\n\nMany producers in sectors such as packaging, textiles, and agriculture are transitioning to bio-based products for straw production. Bio-based materials offer a more environmentally friendly solution compared to traditional plastics. This shift towards bio-based straws further propels the market expansion as businesses and consumers increasingly prioritize sustainability.\n\nHowever, strict government rules and the installation of equipment required for manufacturing paper straws may hinder market growth. Compliance with regulatory requirements and the necessary investments in machinery and infrastructure can pose challenges for manufacturers, potentially limiting the growth rate of the market.\n\nGet a Free Sample PDF copy of the report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bwcc17927\n\nRegional Insights\n\nEurope dominates the market in terms of the highest market shares and is predicted to continue expanding during the projection period. The region has implemented strict limits on single-use plastic products, which has increased the use of alternative straws in the food service sector. Furthermore, manufacturers in industries such as textiles, packaging, and agriculture are actively adopting bio-based products for straw production, driving market growth in Europe. The region's commitment to sustainability and stringent regulations contribute to the dominance and expansion of the market in this region.\n\nMajor market segments of the Paper Straw Market are:\n\nSegmentation based on Product\n\nPrinted\n\nNon-printed\n\nSegmentation based on Material\n\nVirgin paper\n\nRecycled paper\n\nSegmentation based on Application\n\nFoodservice\n\nHousehold\n\nRequest a Sample of this report @https://reportocean.com/industry-verticals/sample-request?report_id=bwcc17927\n\nThe research methodology adopted by analysts to study the market include inputs derived from industry professionals across the value chain and various other secondary research methods, along with primary research as a major tool for market study.\n\nA section of the report covers research on key players moves that include pointers on new entrants, future investors and existing players.\n\nList of major players operating in the Paper Straw market:\n\nCharta Global\n\nBioPak\n\nFuling Global Inc\n\nShenzhen Grizzlies Industries Co.

A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "The Russian city of Orenburg battled rising water levels on Thursday after major rivers across Russia and Kazakhstan burst their banks in the worst flooding seen in the areas in nearly a century.\n\nThe deluge of meltwater has forced over 110,000 people from their homes in Russia's Ural Mountains, Siberia and Kazakhstan as major rivers such as the Ural, which flows through Kazakhstan into the Caspian, overwhelmed embankments, Reuters reported.\n\nResidents in the city of Orenburg said the waters of the Ural rose very swiftly and to far beyond breaking point, forcing them to flee with just their children, pets and a few belongings.\n\n\"It came very quickly at night,\" Taisiya, 71, told Reuters in Orenburg, a city of 550,000 about 1,200 km (750 miles) east of Moscow. \"By the time I got ready, I couldn't get out.\"\n\nWhole areas of the city were underwater, and the Ural rose another 32 cm (13 inches) to 10.54 meters (34.6 ft), 124 cm (49 inches) above the level considered by local authorities as safe. Officials warned the river would rise further.\n\nThe flooding has struck Russia's Urals and the northern Kazakhstan worst, though waters are also rising southern parts of Western Siberia, the largest hydrocarbon basin in the world, and in some places near the Volga, Europe's biggest river.\n\nWater levels were also rising in Siberia's Tomsk, which sits on the Tom River, a tributary of the Ob, and in Kurgan, which straddles the Tobol river.\n\nAfter the Ural burst through dam embankments in Orsk, upstream from Orenburg, on Friday, some residents expressed anger over how local officials had handled the situation, demanding greater compensation and begging for help from President Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin was being updated regularly on the situation but had no current plans to visit the area while emergency services tried to deal with rising waters.\n\nIn Orenburg, some residents expressed disappointment that local officials had not done enough to prepare for the annual snow melt.\n\n\"There is a lot of excitement, indignation and strong emotions that I understand and share,\" Orenburg Mayor Sergei Salmin said. \"The issue of receiving compensation and the procedure for processing payments is one of the main ones.\"\n\nSNOW MELT\n\nSpring flooding is a usual part of life across Russia - which has an area equal to the United States and Australia combined - as the heavy winter snows melt, swelling some of mighty rivers of Russia and Central Asia.\n\nThis year, though, a combination of factors triggered unusually severe flooding, according to emergency workers.\n\nThey said soils were waterlogged before winter and then was frozen under deep snow falls which melted very fast in rising spring temperatures and heavy rains.\n\nClimate researchers have long warned that rising temperatures could increase the incidence of extreme weather events, and that heavily forested Russia is of major importance in the global climate equation.\n\nIn Kurgan, a region which straddles the Tobol river, water levels rose in Zverinogolovkoye beyond the critical 10 meter (33 foot) mark, said Governor Vadim Shumkov who was shown visiting evacuated families.\n\nKazakhstan has been badly hit.\n\nThe emergencies ministry said on Thursday morning that the number of evacuees stood at over 97,000, unchanged from Wednesday, and a state of emergency remained in effect in eight regions of the country.\n\nEmergency workers have removed 8.8 million cubic meters (310 million cubic feet) of water from flooded areas, the ministry said. The Kazakh government also said movement was restricted on hundreds of kilometers of roads in the Aktobe, Akmola, Atyrau, Kostanai, Mangistau and North Kazakhstan regions.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n''I joke that I gave birth to myself,'' he said. ''When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.''\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n''Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,'' Kubilius said. ''To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.''\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or ''Get Lost,'' a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n''Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.''\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n''There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,'' Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. ''After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.''\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n''It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,'' he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. ''I don't care about them,'' he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n''We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,'' explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. ''The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?''\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n''Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,'' he said. ''People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.''\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n''Very cool,'' wrote someone in the comments.\n\n''The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,'' wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n''Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,'' he said. ''But there was no way out for them.''\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: ''You will die.''\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n''You can only leave wounded or dead,'' Yevgeny explained. ''No one wants to leave dead.''\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n''Hurrah!'' shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. ''Are you on the wanted list?'' a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n''You are my Muslim brother,'' he told Farhad. ''I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.''\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's ''Crime and Punishment'' -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. ''I lay down and thought that's the end,'' Farhad said. ''Kaput.'' Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. ''Take your things and get out,'' he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n''We don't know what tomorrow will bring,'' said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. ''In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.''\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n''It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,'' he said. ''I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.''\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. ''In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,'' he said. ''Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,'' Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's ''I Have Nothing'' to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. ''I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,'' he said. ''So I just walk around and sing songs.''\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n''I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,'' he said. ''If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.''\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n''They said, 'You're fired,''' Sparrow recalled. ''You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.''\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. ''I saw this photo - what is all this?'' he thought. ''I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!''\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. ''You still have just one path,'' his commander told him. ''Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.''\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n''I am free,'' he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n''I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,'' he said. ''Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.''\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n''There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,'' he said. ''I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.''\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n''At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,'' he said. ''I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.''\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. ''You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n''What I felt was only disgust,'' he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n''They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,'' he said to the camera. ''Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.''\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n''Putin wanted me to be in a bag,'' he said. ''But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.''\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n''I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,'' he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n''The worst thing that could have happened has happened,'' he said. ''Now only good things are coming.''\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n''There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,'' he said. ''I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n''I teach people to run with pleasure,'' he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. ''I am for people to not get stuck.''\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n''Something new is starting,'' he said. ''I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.''\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "title": "Thousands of Russian soldiers are fleeing the war in Ukraine but have nowhere to go",
        "text": "If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West.

        "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A large global survey issued on Friday showed a surge in despair and disillusionment with established politics, particularly among young American men, the only U.S. population group to turn more conservative over the past decade.\n\nThe study by the international research agency Glocalities, shared with Reuters, offered context for November's U.S. presidential poll and a plethora of votes worldwide, including a European Union parliamentary election in June.\n\nIt surveyed respondents to determine their position on a scale on a scale of optimism between 'hope' and 'despair', and on another between 'control' and 'freedom' - in other words, conservatism and liberalism.\n\nOn average, the world became more liberal between 2014 and 2023, even as it became more pessimistic, according to more than 300,000 surveys in 20 countries representing nearly 60% of the global population.\n\nYoung people the world over feel especially let down by society, said Martijn Lampert, head of research at Glocalities, adding that \"the surge in despair among young adults in the U.S. far outweighs the rise in despair among young adults in EU countries\".\n\nMost strikingly, young U.S. men were the only population group in the United States or seven EU member states actually to have become more conservative since 2014 - or, in the poll's terms, to favour more control rather than freedom.\n\nIn total, 14,526 Americans were polled between 2014 and 2023, including 2,242 men aged 18-34.\n\nWorldwide, \"feelings of hopelessness, societal disillusionment and rebelling against cosmopolitan values partly explain the rise of radical right anti-establishment parties\", Lampert said, citing elections in several European countries.\n\nSocial media algorithms were magnifying the trend by drawing \"moderately conservative young men towards more extreme and radical conservative male role models and world views\".\n\nYOUNG WOMEN 'THE MOST LIBERAL GROUP IN HISTORY'\n\nThe report also highlighted a sharp difference between the world's young men and young women.\n\nBoth were worried about career prospects, financial security and education but while men aged 18-24 overtook men aged 55-70 as the most socially conservative group, women of 18-24 grew more liberal and anti-patriarchal.\n\nOn a scale where 1 represents the most conservative and 5 the most liberal, women worldwide aged 18-24 moved from 3.55 in 2014 to 3.78 in 2023 - both easily the highest for any age group.\n\nMen of the same age moved from 3.29 to 3.36. And in the U.S., men of 18-34 became less liberal, dropping from 3.48 to 3.46.\n\n\"Globally young women are likely the most liberal group in human history,\" the report said.\n\nYoung women were worried above all about social issues such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, child abuse and neglect.\n\nYoung men were more geared towards achieving social and economic status, and set store by conservative family values and competition, bravery and honour.\n\nIf the report offered a glimmer of optimism, it was among the world's men and women over 55, the only groups to become generally more hopeful over the decade, as well as more liberal.\n\nRespondents were asked 43 questions to assess where they ranked.\n\nTo gauge social values, Glocalities assessed their views about patriarchy, gender role flexibility, same-sex marriage and cohabitation before marriage.\n\nThe measurement of sentiment focused on future prospects and feelings about being let down by society.\n\nSurveys were conducted in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Britain and the U.S.\n\n(Reporting by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",

        "title": "Trump to host embattled Speaker Mike Johnson as House swirls in turmoil",
        "text": "PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- House Speaker Mike Johnson is making a campaign pilgrimage to visit Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, a rite of passage as the embattled Republican leader positions himself, and his GOP majority, side-by-side with the indicted ex-president.\n\nThe two are planning a joint announcement on election integrity ahead of November, but the trip itself is significant for both. Johnson needs Trump to temper hard-line Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's threats to evict him from office. And Trump benefits from the imprimatur of official Washington dashing to Florida to embrace his comeback bid for the White House and his tangled election lies.\n\n\"It is the symbolism,\" said Charlie Sykes, a conservative commentator and frequent Trump critic.\n\n\"There was a time when the Speaker of the House of Representatives was a dominant figure in American politics,\" he said. \"Look where we are now, where he comes hat in hand to Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nHaving the House speaker and the presidential contender align for the campaign season is not in itself surprising or even unexpected, a typical arrangement as the party builds a coordinated effort of resources and proposals to present to voters in the fall.\n\nBut in the Trump era, the sojourns by Republican leaders to his private club in Palm Beach, Florida, have become defining moments, underscoring the lopsided partnership as the former president commandeers the party in sometimes humiliating displays of power.\n\nSuch was the case when Kevin McCarthy, then the House GOP leader, trekked to Mar-a-Lago after having been critical of the defeated president after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. A cheery photo was posted afterward, a sign of their mending relationship.\n\nJohnson proposed the idea of coming to Mar-a-Lago weeks before Greene filed her motion to vacate him from the speaker's office. The visit comes just days before the former president's criminal trial on hush money charges gets underway next week in New York City.\n\nThe trip shows the fragility of the speaker's grip on the gavel, just six months on the job since replacing the ousted McCarthy, but also his evolving grasp of the politics of the Trump era.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana understands he needs Trump's backing to conduct almost any business in the House -- including his next big priority, providing U.S. aid to Ukraine to fight Russia's invasion.\n\nThe speaker's own political livelihood depends on support -- or at least not opposition -- from the \"Make America Great Again\" Republicans who are aligned with Trump but creating much of the House dysfunction that has ground work to a halt.\n\nJohnson commands the narrowest majority in modern times and a single quip from the former president can derail legislation. He was once a Trump skeptic, but the two men now talk frequently, including earlier this week.\n\nEven still, Trump urged Republicans to \"kill\" a national security surveillance bill that Johnson had personally worked to pass, contributing to a sudden defeat that sent the House spiraling this week into crisis. It was expected to try again to pass the bill Friday before Johnson departs for Florida.\n\nIn a daring move, the speaker is working both sides to help Ukraine, talking directly to the White House on the national security package that is at risk of collapse with Trump's opposition. Greene is warning of a snap vote to oust Johnson from leadership if he allows any U.S. assistance to flow to the overseas ally.\n\n\"The funding of Ukraine must end,\" Greene said she told Johnson in a private meeting this week.\n\nOn the issue of election integrity, though, Johnson, who led one of the main legal challenges to the 2020 election won by Joe Biden, appears to be more aligned with Trump.\n\nTrump continues to insist the 2020 election was marred by fraud, even though no evidence has emerged in the last four years to support his claims and every state in the nation certified their results as valid.\n\nAs he runs to reclaim the White House, Trump has essentially taken over the Republican National Committee, turning the campaign apparatus toward his priorities. He supported Michael Whatley to lead the RNC, which created a new \"Election Integrity Division\" and says it is working to hire thousands of lawyers across the country.\n\nAt Friday's event they are expected to promote ideas to prevent noncitizens from voting, even though it's already a federal felony for a noncitizen to cast a ballot in a federal election. There's no evidence of significant numbers of immigrants violating that law by casting illegal ballots.\n\nSome liberal cities like San Francisco have begun to allow noncitizens to vote in a few local elections, leading Republicans to argue there need to be even more laws forbidding it in federal elections.\n\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said he was supportive of those proposals. \"How do you ensure that noncitizens are not voting? That's that's what this is all about.\"\n\nWith his majority shrinking due to early retirements and departures, Johnson is operating as a speaker in name only. But the more he depends on Democrats to provide the votes needed to pass substantial legislation, including last month's bills to keep the government from shutting down, the deeper trouble he courts from the MAGA Republicans.\n\nTrump could help Johnson by promoting the House's legislative priorities or, at least, not torpedoing them. But that seems increasingly uncertain as the presumed presidential nominee leads the GOP in a different direction on both domestic and foreign policy priorities.\n\nTired of the infighting and wary of another dragged-out brawl like the monthlong slugfest to replace McCarthy, few Republicans are backing Greene's effort to remove Johnson, for now.\n\n\"Marjorie's actions are horrific,\" said Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, a former Trump administration official. \"They are childish. They are petulant. They have no place here in this body.\"\n\nBut if Trump signals otherwise, that could all change.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker emeritus, said this week on \"The Axe Files\" podcast: \"The Republicans wanted Donald Trump for speaker. And they got him.\"\n\nAssociated Press reporters Stephen Groves, Kevin Freking and Nicholas Riccardi contributed to this report.",

Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A large global survey issued on Friday showed a surge in despair and disillusionment with established politics, particularly among young American men, the only U.S. population group to turn more conservative over the past decade.\n\nThe study by the international research agency Glocalities, shared with Reuters, offered context for November's U.S. presidential poll and a plethora of votes worldwide, including a European Union parliamentary election in June.\n\nIt surveyed respondents to determine their position on a scale on a scale of optimism between 'hope' and 'despair', and on another between 'control' and 'freedom' - in other words, conservatism and liberalism.\n\nOn average, the world became more liberal between 2014 and 2023, even as it became more pessimistic, according to more than 300,000 surveys in 20 countries representing nearly 60% of the global population.\n\nYoung people the world over feel especially let down by society, said Martijn Lampert, head of research at Glocalities, adding that \"the surge in despair among young adults in the U.S. far outweighs the rise in despair among young adults in EU countries\".\n\nMost strikingly, young U.S. men were the only population group in the United States or seven EU member states actually to have become more conservative since 2014 - or, in the poll's terms, to favour more control rather than freedom.\n\nIn total, 14,526 Americans were polled between 2014 and 2023, including 2,242 men aged 18-34.\n\nWorldwide, \"feelings of hopelessness, societal disillusionment and rebelling against cosmopolitan values partly explain the rise of radical right anti-establishment parties\", Lampert said, citing elections in several European countries.\n\nSocial media algorithms were magnifying the trend by drawing \"moderately conservative young men towards more extreme and radical conservative male role models and world views\".\n\nYOUNG WOMEN 'THE MOST LIBERAL GROUP IN HISTORY'\n\nThe report also highlighted a sharp difference between the world's young men and young women.\n\nBoth were worried about career prospects, financial security and education but while men aged 18-24 overtook men aged 55-70 as the most socially conservative group, women of 18-24 grew more liberal and anti-patriarchal.\n\nOn a scale where 1 represents the most conservative and 5 the most liberal, women worldwide aged 18-24 moved from 3.55 in 2014 to 3.78 in 2023 - both easily the highest for any age group.\n\nMen of the same age moved from 3.29 to 3.36. And in the U.S., men of 18-34 became less liberal, dropping from 3.48 to 3.46.\n\n\"Globally young women are likely the most liberal group in human history,\" the report said.\n\nYoung women were worried above all about social issues such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, child abuse and neglect.\n\nYoung men were more geared towards achieving social and economic status, and set store by conservative family values and competition, bravery and honour.\n\nIf the report offered a glimmer of optimism, it was among the world's men and women over 55, the only groups to become generally more hopeful over the decade, as well as more liberal.\n\nRespondents were asked 43 questions to assess where they ranked.\n\nTo gauge social values, Glocalities assessed their views about patriarchy, gender role flexibility, same-sex marriage and cohabitation before marriage.\n\nThe measurement of sentiment focused on future prospects and feelings about being let down by society.\n\nSurveys were conducted in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Britain and the U.S.\n\n(Reporting by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said, declining to give his full name for fear of retribution. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\n\"I did the right thing,\" said another deserter who goes by the nickname Sparrow, who is living in hiding in Kazakhstan while he waits for his asylum applications to be processed. After being forcibly conscripted, he ran away from his barracks because he didn't want to kill anyone. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100 percent Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAsylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert -- more than 500 in the first two months of this year -- are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.\n\nOverall, Sverdlin's group says it has supported more than 26,000 Russians seeking to avoid military service and helped more than 520 active-duty soldiers and officers flee -- a drop in the bucket compared with Russia's overall troop strength, but an indicator of morale in a country that has made it a crime to oppose the war.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nFarhad Ziganshin, an officer who deserted shortly after Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, was detained in Kazakhstan while trying to board a flight to Armenia because local authorities found his name on a Russian wanted list.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" Ziganshin said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe's still waiting on his asylum applications.\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. And less than 10% of the 5,246 people whose applications were processed last year got some sort of protection from German authorities.\n\nBut Russians continue to flee. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021. Affirmative asylum requests nearly quadrupled, to almost 9,000, in the year ending September 2022, the latest data available.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAnother Russian officer, nicknamed Sportsmaster, made a video diary of his escape. As he was about to leave Russia, he did what he could to make a grand gesture to demonstrate his opposition to the war.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to his camera. \"Putin wanted me to be in a bag, but it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said after crossing out of Russia with the remnants of his former life stuffed in one small backpack. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster is an optimist. In fact, deserters have been seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turned up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.\n\nErika Kinetz, The Associated Press",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin.

None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic.

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\n\"What's wrong with you?\" his commander demanded.\n\n\"I just have some stomach problems,\" Sparrow said.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.\n\nErika Kinetz, The Associated Press",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military.

Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A large global survey issued on Friday showed a surge in despair and disillusionment with established politics, particularly among young American men, the only U.S. population group to turn more conservative over the past decade.\n\nThe study by the international research agency Glocalities, shared with Reuters, offered context for November's U.S. presidential poll and a plethora of votes worldwide, including a European Union parliamentary election in June.\n\nIt surveyed respondents to determine their position on a scale on a scale of optimism between 'hope' and 'despair', and on another between 'control' and 'freedom' - in other words, conservatism and liberalism.\n\nOn average, the world became more liberal between 2014 and 2023, even as it became more pessimistic, according to more than 300,000 surveys in 20 countries representing nearly 60% of the global population.\n\nYoung people the world over feel especially let down by society, said Martijn Lampert, head of research at Glocalities, adding that \"the surge in despair among young adults in the U.S. far outweighs the rise in despair among young adults in EU countries\".\n\nMost strikingly, young U.S. men were the only population group in the United States or seven EU member states actually to have become more conservative since 2014 - or, in the poll's terms, to favour more control rather than freedom.\n\nIn total, 14,526 Americans were polled between 2014 and 2023, including 2,242 men aged 18-34.\n\nWorldwide, \"feelings of hopelessness, societal disillusionment and rebelling against cosmopolitan values partly explain the rise of radical right anti-establishment parties\", Lampert said, citing elections in several European countries.\n\nSocial media algorithms were magnifying the trend by drawing \"moderately conservative young men towards more extreme and radical conservative male role models and world views\".\n\nYOUNG WOMEN 'THE MOST LIBERAL GROUP IN HISTORY'\n\nThe report also highlighted a sharp difference between the world's young men and young women.\n\nBoth were worried about career prospects, financial security and education but while men aged 18-24 overtook men aged 55-70 as the most socially conservative group, women of 18-24 grew more liberal and anti-patriarchal.\n\nOn a scale where 1 represents the most conservative and 5 the most liberal, women worldwide aged 18-24 moved from 3.55 in 2014 to 3.78 in 2023 - both easily the highest for any age group.\n\nMen of the same age moved from 3.29 to 3.36. And in the U.S., men of 18-34 became less liberal, dropping from 3.48 to 3.46.\n\n\"Globally young women are likely the most liberal group in human history,\" the report said.\n\nYoung women were worried above all about social issues such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, child abuse and neglect.\n\nYoung men were more geared towards achieving social and economic status, and set store by conservative family values and competition, bravery and honour.\n\nIf the report offered a glimmer of optimism, it was among the world's men and women over 55, the only groups to become generally more hopeful over the decade, as well as more liberal.\n\nRespondents were asked 43 questions to assess where they ranked.\n\nTo gauge social values, Glocalities assessed their views about patriarchy, gender role flexibility, same-sex marriage and cohabitation before marriage.\n\nThe measurement of sentiment focused on future prospects and feelings about being let down by society.\n\nSurveys were conducted in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Britain and the U.S.\n\n(Reporting by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",

        "text": "President Vladimir Putin says Russia won't accept any enforced peace plans. AP\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin mocked Ukraine ahead of a planned peace conference in June saying \"it would have been funny if it weren't so sad\" if Russia is not invited to the negotiation table meant to bring peace to the two warring sides.\n\nEarlier this week, the Swiss government announced plans to host a high-level international summit, inviting over 100 countries, to discuss the way forward for peace in Ukraine following over two years of catastrophic war. They also expressed hope that Russia could potentially participate in the peace efforts in the future.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had also warned that prospective ceasefire negotiations with Ukraine could be a \"useless waste of time\" if they don't take Moscow's interests into account.\n\nRussia has rejected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's 'Peace Formula', which includes demands for the withdrawal of Russian troops, compensation to Ukraine, and accountability through an international tribunal for Russia's actions.\n\nSwiss conference 'some kind of freak show'\n\nWhile asserting that Russia has never rejected a peaceful solution to the Ukrainian conflict, Putin said, during a meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, that he views the 'Ukraine-themed' summit as \"some kind of a freak show.\"\n\nPutin ridiculed the summit saying, \"They believe that we don't belong there. And at the same time, they say that it is impossible to resolve anything without us. It would have been funny, if it were not so sad,\" the Russian president was quoted as saying by _TASS.\n\n_\n\nLukashenko replied that without Russian participation, parties of the 'Ukrainian-themed' conference could only agree on further escalation.\n\n'Ukraine shouldn't sign agreements on West's gunpoint'\n\nRecalling negotiations at the Istanbul summit, Putin said, \"We have never refused to resolve disputes peacefully. Moreover, this is exactly what we were inclined to do.\" But later the President added that the Ukrainian side should not sign peace agreements on gunpoint.\n\nPutin said, \"Ukraine should not sign it [those agreements] 'on a gunpoint',\" and withdraw its troops from Kyiv, but \"then, under the pressure from the West, the Ukrainian side walked out of these agreements.\" \"Immediately after we did this, our agreements were thrown into a trash bin,\" Putin added.\n\nTurkiye has recently proposed a new plan for a \"peaceful\" settlement of Russia's war against Ukraine, which includes a freeze on the war and a non-aligned status for Ukraine, Russian outlet Novaya Gazeta reported.",

        "text": "ASTANA, Kazakhstan (AP) -- If the choice was death or a bullet to the leg, Yevgeny would take the bullet. A decorated hero of Russia's war in Ukraine, Yevgeny told his friend and fellow soldier to please aim carefully and avoid bone. The tourniquets were ready.\n\nThe pain that followed was the price Yevgeny paid for a new chance at life. Like thousands of other Russian soldiers, he deserted the army.\n\n\"I joke that I gave birth to myself,\" he said. \"When a woman gives birth to a child, she experiences very intense pain and gives new life. I gave myself life after going through very intense pain.\"\n\nYevgeny made it out of the trenches. But the new life he found is not what he had hoped for.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with five officers and one soldier who deserted the Russian military. All have criminal cases against them in Russia, where they face 10 years or more in prison. Each is waiting for a welcome from the West that has never arrived. Instead, all but one live in hiding.\n\nFor Western nations grappling with Russia's vast and growing diaspora, Russian soldiers present particular concern: Are they spies? War criminals? Or heroes?\n\nOverall asylum claims from Russian citizens have surged since the full-scale invasion, but few are winning protection. Policymakers remain divided over whether to consider Russians in exile as potential assets or risks to national security.\n\nAndrius Kubilius, a former prime minister of Lithuania now serving in the European Parliament, argues that cultivating Russians who oppose Vladimir Putin is in the strategic self-interest of the West. Fewer Russian soldiers at the front, he added, means a weaker army.\n\n\"Not to believe in Russian democracy is a mistake,\" Kubilius said. \"To say that all Russians are guilty is a mistake.\"\n\nAll but one of the soldiers spoke with AP on condition of anonymity, fearing deportation and persecution of themselves and their families. The AP reviewed legal documents, including criminal case files, Russian public records and military identification papers, as well as photos and videos to verify their stories, but it was impossible to independently corroborate every detail.\n\nIndependent Russian media outlet Mediazona has documented more than 7,300 cases in Russian courts against AWOL soldiers since September 2022; cases of desertion, the harshest charge, leapt sixfold last year.\n\nRecord numbers of people seeking to desert - more than 500 in the first two months of this year - are contacting Idite Lesom, or \"Get Lost,\" a group run by Russian activists in the Republic of Georgia. Last spring, just 3% of requests for help came from soldiers seeking to leave; in January, more than a third did, according to the group's head, Grigory Sverdlin. The numbers of known deserters may be small compared to Russia's overall troop strength, but they are an indicator of morale.\n\n\"Obviously, Russian propaganda is trying to sell us a story that all Russia supports Putin and his war,\" Sverdlin said. \"But that's not true.\"\n\nThe question now is, where can they go?\n\nGerman officials have said that Russians fleeing military service can seek protection, and a French court last summer ruled that Russians who refuse to fight can claim refugee status. In practice, however, it's proven difficult for deserters, most of whom have passports that only allow travel within a handful of former Soviet states, to get asylum, lawyers, activists and deserters say.\n\nFewer than 300 Russians got refugee status in the U.S. in fiscal year 2022. Customs and Border Patrol officials encountered more than 57,000 Russians at U.S. borders in fiscal year 2023, up from around 13,000 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nIn France, asylum requests rose more than 50% between 2022 and 2023, to a total of around 3,400 people, according to the French office that handles the requests. And last year, Germany got 7,663 first-time asylum applications from Russian citizens, up from 2,851 in 2022, Germany's Interior Ministry told AP in an email. None of the data specifies how many were soldiers.\n\nAs they count the days until their legal right to stay in Kazakhstan ends, Yevgeny - and the others - have watched other deserters get seized by Russian forces in Armenia, deported from Kazakhstan and turn up dead, riddled with bullets, in Spain.\n\n\"There is no mechanism for Russians who do not want to fight, deserters, to get to a safe place,\" Yevgeny said. He urges Western policymakers to reconsider. \"After all, it's much cheaper economically to allow a person into your country -- a healthy young man who can work -- than to supply Ukraine with weapons.\"\n\nYEVGENY\n\nSitting in his spartan room in Astana, Kazakhstan, Yevgeny rummaged through a cardboard box that holds the things he thought to save.\n\n\"It's like a woman's handbag, there's so much stuff,\" he muttered, poking around real and fake passports, a letter with hearts on it, blister packs of pills.\n\nHe can't find his military medals. He has the certificates, though, commemorating his service in Syria and Ukraine.\n\nYevgeny seems suddenly ashamed. \"I don't care about them,\" he said, shoving everything back in the box.\n\nThe son of postal workers, Yevgeny went to military school mostly because it was free. He did 41 parachute jumps, and learned to ride horses, dive, shoot and handle explosives. The cost of his education would come after graduation: five years of mandatory military service.\n\nThe night of Feb. 23, 2022, Yevgeny and his unit barely slept. Their tanks, hulking and dark, cast long shadows on a thin layer of snow beside the railroad tracks that would carry them toward Ukraine. Yevgeny was too drunk with fatigue to think much about what would happen next.\n\nOn Yevgeny's second day at war, an officer leaned against his machine gun and shot off his own finger, he said. Later, a guy fell asleep under a military vehicle and died when it drove over him. People got lost and never came back.\n\nIn the chaos, around 10 men in his unit were accidentally killed with guns or grenades. One soldier shot another square in the chest. What were they doing, Yevgeny wondered, testing their bulletproof vests? None of it made sense in a world where life mattered. But Yevgeny wasn't in that world anymore.\n\nThe deeper Yevgeny moved into Ukraine, the uglier things got.\n\n\"We didn't want to kill anyone, but we also wanted to live,\" explained Yevgeny, a senior lieutenant who oversaw a platoon of around 15 men. \"The locals would come in civilian cars and shoot at our military. What would you do?\"\n\nHe said that Ukrainian prisoners of war were executed because the Russians couldn't get them back to Russia and didn't want to build detention centers.\n\n\"Special people were chosen for this, because a lot of others refused,\" he said. \"People with a special, so to speak, psyche were appointed executioners.\"\n\nThere are things Yevgeny can't forget: A 14-year-old Ukrainian boy who seemed to be making Molotov cocktails and was executed. A 24-year-old Ukrainian woman caught with compromising information on her phone raped by two Russian soldiers.\n\nYevgeny was within breathing distance of Kyiv when Moscow ordered a retreat. In a single day in April 2022, around seventy people from his brigade died in an ambush, he said. The Ukrainian military released a video of the encounter with the retreating column.\n\nPop, pop, pop go the fireballs. Little flags bob above the tanks, giving it the feel of a video game. Shells crash a bit off to the left. Then, a hit. The video cuts to a magnified image of a Russian tank pluming black smoke, two lifeless bodies curled beside it.\n\n\"Very cool,\" wrote someone in the comments.\n\n\"The best sight in my life is to see how the Russians die,\" wrote another.\n\nYevgeny was in that column. He knows men who are dying in those balls of fire. His face is flat. He doesn't want to see it again.\n\n\"Many of my friends have died. And these were really good guys who didn't want to fight,\" he said. \"But there was no way out for them.\"\n\nHe is crying.\n\nIf he could, Yevgeny would go back to 2013, the year he entered military school. He would stand sentinel at the gates of his school and tell all the boys go home, stay away, this place is not what it seems.\n\nHe wants them to understand three words: \"You will die.\"\n\nIt took Yevgeny less than three months at war to decide to get himself shot in the leg.\n\n\"You can only leave wounded or dead,\" Yevgeny explained. \"No one wants to leave dead.\"\n\nHe made a pact with three other soldiers. They called it their Plan B. Yevgeny would take the first bullet, then the comms guy, then the sniper. The machine gunner said he didn't want to leave Ukraine without his brother, who was also fighting, but he'd stand by their story.\n\nOne chill May morning, as they trudged through even columns of pine trees on their way to retrieve a drone that had landed in Ukrainian territory, Yevgeny and his friends decided it was time for Plan B. They'd already lost one man in that area and now felt like they were on a suicide mission.\n\nWhen the sniper shot Yevgeny, the pain was like a strong man hammering a 9 mm metal bar into his flesh. Then the comms guy took a bullet to his thigh. After seeing the two of them crumple and scowl, the third man chickened out.\n\nBlood kept gushing, despite the tourniquet, and Yevgeny was shocked to discover he couldn't walk. His friends dragged him 300 meters back through the woods. He was given sweet tea and evacuated that same evening.\n\nYevgeny spent months in rehabilitation and figured he could ride out his injury until his contract expired in June 2023. But after Putin's announcement of partial mobilization in September 2022, it no longer mattered what his contract said. Soldiers like him were now obliged to serve until the end of the war.\n\nHe knew he had to leave. He made it to Kazakhstan in early 2023, with the help of Idite Lesom. Russian authorities filed a criminal case against him. His relatives back in Russia were questioned, his apartment there searched.\n\nSince then, Yevgeny has been doing his best to disappear. He found a place in Astana in an apartment that stank of cat. They were four men with only three cups, three spoons and three chairs to go around. They boiled water with an electric coil in a glass jar because no one wanted to splurge for a kettle.\n\nHe worked for a few weeks skittering around Astana on an old motorcycle delivering food. But his paychecks never arrived, possibly because his SIM card and bank account were in different people's names.\n\nHe doesn't know what he'll do when his savings run out. He said he's applied for asylum in France, Germany and the United States - obviously the best place to hide from Russia, he said. He'd like serve in a U.N. mission somewhere, but it's hard for him to conceive a path from here to there.\n\nHe wakes at ten o'clock, steps out of the shower into another molten, formless day. That night, he will comb his hair and go out to a bar with other deserters, to pass a few sparkling hours as a normal guy.\n\nAt the bar, someone remembered that it was the one-year anniversary of Russia's September 2022 mobilization. Putin drafted 300,000 troops to fight in Ukraine. Tens of thousands of them are now dead.\n\nThe table went quiet. Yevgeny searched for a word that meant the opposite of evil so they could drink to it.\n\nIn the end, they raised their glasses to virtue, then to peace.\n\nFARHAD\n\nWithin hours of Putin's September 2022 mobilization decree, threatening messages started pinging in on Farhad Ziganshin's phone. A small man with a big voice, Farhad had abandoned a career in music for the military to please his dad. He'd tried to resign from the armed forces, but the military school where he taught rejected his application, he said.\n\nPanicked, he piled into the family Chevrolet with his mother, sister, dog and aunt and took off for the Kazakh border near midnight. They'd try to make it look like a fun family vacation. The roads were jammed with other Russians fleeing Putin's draft.\n\n\"Hurrah!\" shouted Farhad, pumping his fists in the air, as they left Russia.\n\nFarhad landed a job at a burger joint near the border, then followed a friend of a friend to Almaty, Kazakhstan's largest city, where he'd been promised work as a singer. He ended up working in a banquet hall, sleeping on a vast, golden bed in a newlywed suite and eating as much leftover food as he wanted.\n\nLife was good, but uncertain. Kazakhstan was playing a delicate game, trying to assuage Russia without distancing allies in Europe. In December 2022, Kazakhstan deported a Russian intelligence officer, Mikhail Zhilin, who had deserted. In March 2023, a Russian court sentenced Zhilin to six and a half years in prison.\n\nThat same month, Farhad decided to move to Armenia, thinking it was probably safer. But he was blocked from boarding his flight. \"Are you on the wanted list?\" a border agent asked as he flicked through Farhad's passport. Farhad went pale. Cold sweat prickled over his body.\n\nHe was led to a room for questioning. A man in civilian clothes sat across from him.\n\n\"You are my Muslim brother,\" he told Farhad. \"I'm also against the war. Tell me everything.\"\n\nFarhad confessed.\n\nFarhad tried to brace himself for what was to come. He slipped his toothbrush, toothpaste, socks, slippers, snacks and a book - Dostoevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" -- into a transparent bag. His cell at the detention center had a metal door with a small window and slot for food, a security camera and a hole in the floor for a toilet.\n\nFarhad stared at the ceiling all night, his panic mounting: How am I going to live here? Will I be beaten or raped? I'd kill myself first.\n\nThe morning of his third day in detention, three huge bags arrived for Farhad, packed with food, clothes and cigarettes from local human rights activists. \"I lay down and thought that's the end,\" Farhad said. \"Kaput.\" Why would he need all this stuff if he weren't in for a long incarceration?\n\nTwo hours later, a police officer appeared. \"Take your things and get out,\" he ordered.\n\nFarhad was free.\n\nFarhad's lawyer told AP he was released because under the Kazakh criminal code, as well as multilateral agreements with Russia, suspects accused of military crimes can't be extradited. Farhad was safe, at least for the moment.\n\n\"We don't know what tomorrow will bring,\" said his lawyer, Artur Alkhastov, who works with the Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law in Astana. \"In Kazakhstan, politics is higher than the law. . . Everything can change.\"\n\nIn July, independent Russia media reported that France had rejected Farhad's application for asylum. What actually happened was that Farhad's application for a travel permit to France to apply for asylum had been denied, Alkhastov said.\n\nWithout an international passport, Farhad was stuck in Kazakhstan. Moreover, the publicity raised fears that Russian authorities would take fresh interest in his case. Farhad moved from Almaty to Astana, the capital, to lower his profile.\n\n\"It's not safe to stay in Kazakhstan,\" he said. \"I just try to lead a normal life, without violating the laws of Kazakhstan, without being too visible, without appearing anywhere. We have a proverb: Be quieter than water and lower than grass.\"\n\nHe changes his SIM card every few months, doesn't live at his registered address and avoids employers who ask too many questions. After six weeks, he ran out of money and moved in with another Russian deserter, Yevgeny. His bed was a pile of coats and sweaters on the floor. It was impossible to sleep. His back was killing him.\n\nHe thought of the life he'd left behind in Russia. \"In Kazan, I had a completely different life. I had my own apartment, I had a job there, I earned money, I had staff under my command,\" he said. \"Here I am living sleeping on coats, eating I don't know what. And without any money in my pocket. It's very depressing,\" Online, people call him a coward and traitor and say he should be killed.\n\nFarhad got a job at a real estate startup that didn't ask for documents. Every morning, he sang Whitney Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" to his co-workers.\n\nAfter work, Farhad liked to walk around Astana, singing deep slow songs to himself to fill the darkening hours. He dreamed of starting a family but couldn't afford to take a woman out to the movies. \"I can't fall in love with someone and have someone fall in love with me,\" he said. \"So I just walk around and sing songs.\"\n\nBut he wanted to believe that he had made a worthy choice.\n\n\"I realized that I didn't want to serve in this kind of Russian army that destroys cities, kills civilians, and forcibly appropriates foreign land and territory,\" he said. \"If perhaps watching, listening to my story could bring even one person to reason, I would have made a certain contribution.\"\n\nSix months later, the real estate business has collapsed and Farhad is trying to sell flooring instead. He moved into an apartment of his own, but keeps missing rent payments. He's been warned that his legal right to stay in Kazakhstan is coming to an end. He doesn't know what to do next.\n\nSPARROW\n\nSparrow knew from the start that money could mean the difference between life and death. The month before he was born, his father was killed in a gambling dispute over money. His mother raised him, along with his brother and sister, alone, working as a cook in an orphanage in a tiny village.\n\nLater, he moved farther north, to work in a diamond-mining town not far from the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe company Sparrow worked for owned more than diamonds. They effectively owned the town, sponsoring its theater, schools, hospital, sports complex and apartment blocks. As it turned out, they also owned Sparrow.\n\nSparrow finished his shift the afternoon of Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, and was cleaning his Bobcat when his boss came by and told him to report immediately to human resources. They took his passport and military ID and locked them in a safe.\n\n\"They said, 'You're fired,'\" Sparrow recalled. \"You have one hour to get to the military recruitment point. If you don't, you'll have a criminal case against you.\"\n\nSparrow obeyed. At 6 a.m. the next morning, he and hundreds of other conscripts boarded a heavy old plane bound for a military base in the regional capital.\n\nThe thought of war did not cross Sparrow's mind. All he could think about was his job. Sparrow is delicately composed, with a pale, Asian face, ink-dark eyes and bone-china cheeks. Unable to finish university, he worked hard at laying road. Winters, he endured temperatures so extreme they could crack a backhoe. Why had they fired him?\n\nWhen he arrived, the military base was chaos. Some 6,000 people were crammed into the barracks, he calculated, and no one was giving orders. Men spilled over each other, hiving off into small groups to drink. He couldn't find a free bed, so he dropped his bag in a corner and curled up on the floor.\n\nThe next day, he found his way to an information stand to figure out who was in charge. But instead of a list of personnel, he found photographs of dead people and an exhortation to kill Ukrainian soldiers. \"I saw this photo - what is all this?\" he thought. \"I'm not going anywhere to kill people - never!\"\n\nSparrow pulled his commander aside to try to find a way to avoid going where he was being sent. He would serve in a different way. He could pay.\n\nThe commander was not interested in bribes and told him that if he didn't fight with the Russian armed forces, he'd end up with a private military company, like Yevgeny Prigozhin's then-powerful Wagner Group. \"You still have just one path,\" his commander told him. \"Write a refusal, you will go to jail, and we know where you will end up, at PMC Wagner.\"\n\nHe was 30 years old. He called his mother for help.\n\nSparrow's guts couldn't take it. He ran to the bathroom. He paced in anxious circles. Then ran to the bathroom again. And again.\n\nWhile the commander was at lunch, Sparrow grabbed his ID, telephone and civilian clothes and headed for a hole in the wall. His mother was waiting on the other side.\n\nThe next morning, they boarded the first flight out of town. Forty hours later, Sparrow was in Kazakhstan.\n\nAstana felt fresh and warm. He realized he'd been cold his entire life.\n\n\"I am free,\" he told himself.\n\nFreedom for Sparrow actually meant a bigger cage.\n\nTwo weeks after he fled, Russian authorities opened a criminal case against him. Russian media reported on his case, and Sparrow felt the publicity only increased the size of the target on his back. The charges against him were soon upgraded under a tough new clause in Russia's criminal code. Now he faces up to 15 years in prison if he gets sent back to Russia.\n\nSecurity agents interrogated his mother back in Russia. Before he ditched his Russian SIM, he used to get calls from Russian police who said they knew where he was. In October, a man claiming to be a Kazakh policeman started calling him to set up a meeting. He said he'd wait for a summons. None ever came.\n\nSparrow is afraid of the background checks that come with permanent employment. Instead, he picks up occasional jobs collecting trash or hauling equipment at construction sites.\n\nHe was going to bed at 4 a.m. and waking at noon. He couldn't even get back to Russia to bury his grandfather.\n\nSparrow's eyes went red with tears.\n\n\"I don't want anything in life. I have no interest in my own affairs,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't understand myself. I just sit all day on the Internet, on YouTube, and read news, news, news of what's going on in Ukraine, and that's it.\"\n\nHe doesn't know the status of his own asylum applications. Without a foreign passport, how could he leave Kazakhstan anyway? Every time he dared to believe something good might happen to him, it hasn't. Why try?\n\nOutside his bare apartment, he could hear the cries of children who are not his, the thwack of a ball from a game he is not playing, the voices of men speaking to friends he does not have.\n\n\"There are moments I regret, but I did the right thing,\" he said. \"I'd rather sit here and suffer and look for something than go there and kill a human being because of some unclear war, which is 100% Russia's fault. I don't regret it.\"\n\nSPORTSMASTER\n\nAs a child, the boy was not particularly good at school, but he could run. His mother was raising him alone in a village in Western Russia hemmed in by busted coal mines, a place as short on hope as it was on jobs. She called a friend to get her son a spot at a military school. The family wouldn't have to pay a cent. It looked like a ticket to a better life.\n\nAt the military academy, the boy studied engineering to become a radio technician. But his real passion was sports. He wanted to run faster than anyone else.\n\nNow known by the nickname Sportsmaster, he ultimately commanded 30 men, but said he never went into combat. He stayed in service even after he'd fulfilled his five-year contract: He didn't want to be a burden on his mother and who else was going to pay him to run?\n\nThe night Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Sportsmaster jolted awake for no reason at 3 a.m. and spent three sickening hours glued to the television in disbelief. By dawn, all hope had drained from his body. He knew he would be ordered to fight.\n\n\"At that moment, I immediately decided that I would not support it in any way, not even lift my little finger to support what had begun,\" he said. \"I understood that this was a point of no return that would change the lives of the entire country, including mine.\"\n\nSportsmaster said he stopped showing up at his base. In October 2022, his paychecks stopped coming.\n\nHis coach, the head of military sports training, told him to report to the base, they'd find something easy for him to do and he'd get paid again. It was a tempting offer from a trusted mentor.\n\nHis commanders were waiting for him beneath a huge portrait of a legendary Russian military hero. As he entered the room, they began to speak. It took a moment for the words to become clear: Special Military Operation. Order. Luhansk.\n\nHe realized they were reading out his combat orders. He'd been tricked. They told him to sign.\n\nHe refused to touch the pen.\n\nThe brigade's chief of staff picked up a book with a Russian flag on the cover, a copy of Russia's Criminal Code. \"You either go to jail or you go there,\" he said. \"You have only two options.\"\n\nSeized by panic, Sportsmaster turned to leave. He had to get out of the building before they locked him inside. His division's chief of staff grabbed him by the shoulder, but he slipped away and did what he did best: run.\n\nHe pounded down three flights of stairs, taking six turns on a zig-zagging staircase, blew past the guards at the door and beelined for a stretch of fence far from any checkpoint. He grabbed onto the black metal bars of the fence and heaved himself over, clearing the speared tips, 2.5 meters tall, without a scratch.\n\n\"What I felt was only disgust,\" he said.\n\nIdite Lesom gave him step-by-step instructions for how to slip out of Russia. AP is withholding details of the route.\n\nBefore he left, he recorded a video, a political message for the keepers of whatever country he might end up in, a plea to convince them of his friendship.\n\n\"They wanted to force me to go fight against the free people of Ukraine,\" he said to the camera. \"Our freedom is taken away from us every day, but Putin wanted to steal it from them in three days.\"\n\nAnd he did what he could to make a grand gesture.\n\n\"Putin wanted me to be in a bag,\" he said. \"But it's his uniform that will be in a bag.\"\n\nHe shoved his military uniforms in two black trash bags and threw them in a dumpster.\n\nNear midnight that same day, his mother stood in a pool of streetlight in an empty parking lot, weeping. As her son filmed her from the bus taking him away, she forced a strained, sorrowful smile.\n\nThe bus carried Sportsmaster and his girlfriend back to the town where he learned to be a soldier.\n\n\"I always thought I was being trained to protect my country and defend it, but it turned out that I was being taught to attack and conquer,\" he said.\n\nBy that afternoon, they were out of Russia and beaming. He was optimistic. At the least, he would not have to show up to his court hearing in Russia, where he faced criminal charges for not participating in the war.\n\n\"The worst thing that could have happened has happened,\" he said. \"Now only good things are coming.\"\n\nSportsmaster and his girlfriend found a studio apartment in one of the teeming, anonymous buildings slapped up at the edges of Astana.\n\nSix months later, like the other deserters, he's hiding in plain sight. No SIM card of his own. No clear path to citizenship or asylum. The gnawing peril of a knock at the door.\n\n\"There are Russian agents here who try to push Kazakhstan under Russia's wing,\" he said. \"I can't say it's as safe here as I would like because where the wind blows, Kazakhstan will turn.\"\n\nHe doesn't have an international passport and if he tried to cross the border, he'd likely be arrested because of the criminal case against him in Russia.\n\nWhile he waits for the wind to turn in his favor, Sportsmaster has found work as a trainer in Astana. Business is booming.\n\n\"I teach people to run with pleasure,\" he said, bursting into an incandescent smile. \"I am for people to not get stuck.\"\n\nOn his daily runs, Sportsmaster eats through 10 kilometers in 40 minutes with animal grace. His breath is even, his heartbeat slow, at ease -- if only for a moment -- with his place in the world.\n\nHe wants people to understand that there are Russians with dignity.\n\n\"Something new is starting,\" he said. \"I will not let anyone decide my destiny for me.\"\n\n___\n\nAP journalists Geir Moulson in Berlin, Lori Hinnant in Paris and Rebecca Santana in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nIn a joint production, The Associated Press and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting broadcast the story of an underground network of Russian anti-war activists helping soldiers abandon Vladimir Putin's war in Ukraine.",

        "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A large global survey issued on Friday showed a surge in despair and disillusionment with established politics, particularly among young American men, the only U.S. population group to turn more conservative over the past decade.\n\nThe study by the international research agency Glocalities, shared with Reuters, offered context for November's U.S. presidential poll and a plethora of votes worldwide, including a European Union parliamentary election in June.\n\nIt surveyed respondents to determine their position on a scale on a scale of optimism between 'hope' and 'despair', and on another between 'control' and 'freedom' - in other words, conservatism and liberalism.\n\nOn average, the world became more liberal between 2014 and 2023, even as it became more pessimistic, according to more than 300,000 surveys in 20 countries representing nearly 60% of the global population.\n\nYoung people the world over feel especially let down by society, said Martijn Lampert, head of research at Glocalities, adding that \"the surge in despair among young adults in the U.S. far outweighs the rise in despair among young adults in EU countries\".\n\nMost strikingly, young U.S. men were the only population group in the United States or seven EU member states actually to have become more conservative since 2014 - or, in the poll's terms, to favour more control rather than freedom.\n\nIn total, 14,526 Americans were polled between 2014 and 2023, including 2,242 men aged 18-34.\n\nWorldwide, \"feelings of hopelessness, societal disillusionment and rebelling against cosmopolitan values partly explain the rise of radical right anti-establishment parties\", Lampert said, citing elections in several European countries.\n\nSocial media algorithms were magnifying the trend by drawing \"moderately conservative young men towards more extreme and radical conservative male role models and world views\".\n\nYOUNG WOMEN 'THE MOST LIBERAL GROUP IN HISTORY'\n\nThe report also highlighted a sharp difference between the world's young men and young women.\n\nBoth were worried about career prospects, financial security and education but while men aged 18-24 overtook men aged 55-70 as the most socially conservative group, women of 18-24 grew more liberal and anti-patriarchal.\n\nOn a scale where 1 represents the most conservative and 5 the most liberal, women worldwide aged 18-24 moved from 3.55 in 2014 to 3.78 in 2023 - both easily the highest for any age group.\n\nMen of the same age moved from 3.29 to 3.36. And in the U.S., men of 18-34 became less liberal, dropping from 3.48 to 3.46.\n\n\"Globally young women are likely the most liberal group in human history,\" the report said.\n\nYoung women were worried above all about social issues such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, child abuse and neglect.\n\nYoung men were more geared towards achieving social and economic status, and set store by conservative family values and competition, bravery and honour.\n\nIf the report offered a glimmer of optimism, it was among the world's men and women over 55, the only groups to become generally more hopeful over the decade, as well as more liberal.\n\nRespondents were asked 43 questions to assess where they ranked.\n\nTo gauge social values, Glocalities assessed their views about patriarchy, gender role flexibility, same-sex marriage and cohabitation before marriage.\n\nThe measurement of sentiment focused on future prospects and feelings about being let down by society.\n\nSurveys were conducted in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Britain and the U.S.\n\n(Reporting by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",

        "text": "AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A large global survey issued on Friday showed a surge in despair and disillusionment with established politics, particularly among young American men, the only U.S. population group to turn more conservative over the past decade.\n\nThe study by the international research agency Glocalities, shared with Reuters, offered context for November's U.S. presidential poll and a plethora of votes worldwide, including a European Union parliamentary election in June.\n\nIt surveyed respondents to determine their position on a scale on a scale of optimism between 'hope' and 'despair', and on another between 'control' and 'freedom' - in other words, conservatism and liberalism.\n\nOn average, the world became more liberal between 2014 and 2023, even as it became more pessimistic, according to more than 300,000 surveys in 20 countries representing nearly 60% of the global population.\n\nYoung people the world over feel especially let down by society, said Martijn Lampert, head of research at Glocalities, adding that \"the surge in despair among young adults in the U.S. far outweighs the rise in despair among young adults in EU countries\".\n\nMost strikingly, young U.S. men were the only population group in the United States or seven EU member states actually to have become more conservative since 2014 - or, in the poll's terms, to favour more control rather than freedom.\n\nIn total, 14,526 Americans were polled between 2014 and 2023, including 2,242 men aged 18-34.\n\nWorldwide, \"feelings of hopelessness, societal disillusionment and rebelling against cosmopolitan values partly explain the rise of radical right anti-establishment parties\", Lampert said, citing elections in several European countries.\n\nSocial media algorithms were magnifying the trend by drawing \"moderately conservative young men towards more extreme and radical conservative male role models and world views\".\n\nYOUNG WOMEN 'THE MOST LIBERAL GROUP IN HISTORY'\n\nThe report also highlighted a sharp difference between the world's young men and young women.\n\nBoth were worried about career prospects, financial security and education but while men aged 18-24 overtook men aged 55-70 as the most socially conservative group, women of 18-24 grew more liberal and anti-patriarchal.\n\nOn a scale where 1 represents the most conservative and 5 the most liberal, women worldwide aged 18-24 moved from 3.55 in 2014 to 3.78 in 2023 - both easily the highest for any age group.\n\nMen of the same age moved from 3.29 to 3.36. And in the U.S., men of 18-34 became less liberal, dropping from 3.48 to 3.46.\n\n\"Globally young women are likely the most liberal group in human history,\" the report said.\n\nYoung women were worried above all about social issues such as sexual harassment, domestic violence, child abuse and neglect.\n\nYoung men were more geared towards achieving social and economic status, and set store by conservative family values and competition, bravery and honour.\n\nIf the report offered a glimmer of optimism, it was among the world's men and women over 55, the only groups to become generally more hopeful over the decade, as well as more liberal.\n\nRespondents were asked 43 questions to assess where they ranked.\n\nTo gauge social values, Glocalities assessed their views about patriarchy, gender role flexibility, same-sex marriage and cohabitation before marriage.\n\nThe measurement of sentiment focused on future prospects and feelings about being let down by society.\n\nSurveys were conducted in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Britain and the U.S.\n\n(Reporting by Anthony Deutsch; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",

        "text": "Washington, DC [US], April 12 (ANI): The United States' defence commitments to Japan and the Philippines are \"ironclad,\" US President Joe Biden said on Thursday as he hosted the first-ever trilateral summit between the three countries, welcoming Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr to the White House a day after the official visit of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, CNN reported.\n\nThe US-Japan-Philippines trilateral comes after the creation of groupings in the Indo-Pacific, starting with the Quad, comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan, and the AUKUS, consisting of Australia, the US and the UK, amid increasing concerns over China's military muscle-flexing in the region.\n\n\"When we stand as one, we're able to forge a better future for all,\" Biden said in the East Room of the White House Thursday.\n\nAccording to CNN, tensions between the Philippines and China have been focused on the Second Thomas Shoal, situated approximately 200 kilometres off the coast of Palawan, Philippines. In the 1990s, the Philippines intentionally grounded an aging World War II-era navy transport ship on the shoal to reinforce its territorial claim. The ship is now mostly a rusted wreckage and is manned by Filipino marines stationed on rotation.\n\nMeanwhile, China asserts sovereignty over the shoal, located within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, as part of its broader claims in the South China Sea, disregarding an international arbitration ruling.\n\nRecent clashes have occurred when Philippine attempts to resupply the forces on the ship have been met by China Coast Guard ships firing water cannons at the Philippine resupply boats, resulting in injuries to Filipino sailors and damage to the vessels, as per CNN.\n\nBiden said on Thursday, referencing the Filipino-Chinese tensions, that \"any attack on Philippine aircraft, vessels or armed forces in the South China Sea would invoke our mutual defence treaty.\"The 1951 mutual defence treaty between the US and the Philippines, the oldest of its kind in the Asia-Pacific region, obligates both nations to come to each other's defence in the event of an attack by a third party.\n\nThursday's meeting signifies the administration's ongoing efforts to address Chinese aggression, with a senior administration official expressing deep concern over China's actions in the South China Sea, and affirming at the head of the meeting that the White House is very concerned by China's actions in the South China Sea.\n\n\"What you'll see is a clear demonstration of support and resolve from both President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida that we stand shoulder to shoulder with Marcos, ready to support and work with the Philippines at every turn,\" one official said ahead of Thursday's meeting.\n\nMarcos said on Thursday that the Philippines, Japan and the United States \"meet today as friends and partners bound by a shared vision in pursuit of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.\"The three countries, Marcos added, are \"linked by a profound respect for democracy, good governance and the rule of law.\"The meeting coincides with heightened concerns over China's assertive stance towards Taiwan and the South China Sea, coupled with nuclear provocations from North Korea and its evolving ties with Russia. These concerns have prompted regional allies to draw closer to the US.\n\nJapan has emerged as a focal point in President Biden's efforts to strengthen alliances in the Indo-Pacific. Prime Minister Kishida has been viewed as a cooperative partner, having made significant adjustments to Japan's defence strategy in recent years. Additionally, Japan has provided ongoing support to Ukraine in the wake of Russia's invasion, demonstrating its commitment to international security. Kishida has pledged to increase defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP by 2037 and has bolstered Japan's counterstrike capabilities by acquiring American Tomahawk missiles.\n\nBiden hosted Marcos at the White House last year, showing his intent to reestablish strong ties with Manila that had frayed under former President Rodrigo Duterte, who sought closer relations with China.\n\n\"We're going to continue to support the Philippines military's modernization goals,\" Biden told the visiting leader during that visit, pledging the two nations \"not only share a strong partnership, we share a deep friendship, one that has been enriched by millions of Filipino Americans in the communities all across the United States.\"A highlight of Thursday's meeting was several announcements meant to bolster the Philippines.\n\nA senior administration official also said that on Thursday, the White House will be announcing a new infrastructure project in the Philippines. CNN reported earlier this week that one of the announcements will be the development of a new rail and shipping corridor between the Philippines's Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base, a move that's meant to send a clear message to Beijing.\n\nBiden briefly referenced that economic corridor on Thursday: \"It means more jobs for people across the entire region,\" he said. \"It means more investment in sectors critical to our future: clean energy, ports, railroads, agriculture and much more.\"The White House is also expected to increase the Filipino military's capability with a new infrastructure investment similar to what the US announced in India in the lead-up to the G20.\n\nIn the days leading up to the summit, the US, Japan and the Philippines along with Australia, conducted maritime military exercises near the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), after Philippine vessels had alleged \"harassment\" by Chinese ships in the South China Sea.\n\nThe senior official added that the White House will also be making announcements about \"Open Radio Access Network technology\" and that both the US and Japan will be providing millions of dollars in funding.\n\nOfficials also said they will announce an upcoming Coast Guard patrol in the Indo-Pacific that will take place \"in the coming year.\" (ANI)",

        "text": "Following the loss, the 17-year-old Gukesh was down to the joint second spot on four points along with Caruana and Praggnanandhaa.\n\nGrandmaster D Gukesh slipped from the joint top spot after suffering his first defeat, at the hands of Frenchman Firouza Alireza, but teen prodigy R Praggnanandhaa played out an easy draw with American Fabiano Caruana in the seventh round of the Candidates chess tournament here.\n\nFollowing the loss, the 17-year-old Gukesh was down to the joint second spot on four points along with Caruana and Praggnanandhaa.\n\nRussia's Ian Nepomniachtchi regained his slender half-point lead inching to 4.5 points out of a possible seven at the half-way stage following a draw with American Hikaru Nakamura.\n\nStay updated with the latest from IPL 2024, including top contenders for the IPL 2024 Orange Cap and IPL 2024 Purple Cap. Explore the complete IPL 2024 Schedule, IPL 2024 Points Table and players with the Most Sixes, Most Fours and Most Fifties in IPL 2024\n\nAfter a draw with Nijat Abasov, Vidit Gujrathi took his tally to 3.5 points to share the fifth spot with Nakamura while Alireza pulled himself up a little on 2.5 points to take the seventh spot. Abasov with two points is still in the last place.\n\nIn the women's section, R Vaishali seemed to have run out of steam as she suffered her third loss in the event. Tingjie Lei of China proved too good for the Indian on a day when the other three games ended in draws.\n\nZhongyi Tan of China remained half a point ahead of the pack after drawing with closest rival Aleksandra Goryachkina of Russia.\n\nKateryna Lagno, Russia, played out a draw with Nurgyul Salimova of Bulgaria and in the other game of the day, Anna Muzychuk signed peace with India's Koneru Humpy.\n\nThe Indian challenge in the women's section might already have ended as Zhongyi stood firmly ahead on five points while Goryachkina had 4.5 points in her kitty.\n\nLagno and Lei shared the third spot on four points each and Salimova, on three, was occupying the sole fifth position.\n\nHumpy, Vaishali and Muzychuk need a miracle in the second half of the event to make a comeback as the trio has just 2.5 points.\n\nAlireza was a bit lucky to beat Gukesh out of a London system.\n\nIt was one of those days for Gukesh when things did not go as planned and even though the Indian enjoyed a good position in the middle game, going for unwarranted complications proved costly.\n\nGukesh ended up losing a piece but his position would still have been holdable despite the material deficit. However, as things unfolded, Alireza won this race with some timely checkmate threats.\n\nPraggnanandhaa employed the French defense and it was already a surprise for Caruana who went for the advance variation.\n\nThe 18-year-old Indian did not have much trouble in maintaining the balance in the ensuing middle game as the players reached an equal endgame with no chance of a breakthrough. The draw was agreed to after 41 moves.\n\nVidit Gujrathi came close against Abasov. The Berlin defense has been the go-to opening for the Nasik-based player and this time too, it gave him a good position after Abasov misplayed in the middle game.\n\nHowever, as it turned out, the Azerbaijani defended quite well in the latter part of the game and split the point.\n\nIan Nepomniachtchi went for a very complicated Petroff defense as black against Nakamura and the American looked in control after gobbling up material on the queen side.\n\nWith an exchange and a pawn plus, Nakamura put up stiff defense against his vulnerable king but Nepomniachtchi won the queen eventually for three pieces to force a draw.\n\nTingjie won in style against Vaishali, who did not have many answers against a king side attack out of an Italian opening.\n\nThe Indian got a balanced middle game but the position started to drift in the Chinese favour in the middle game ultimately allowing a Knight sacrifice. The game lasted 36 moves.\n\nHumpy faced the Ruy Lopez as black against Muzychuk. The trade of queens and many pawns later, the players arrived at a theoretically drawn rook and pawns endgame where peace was signed after 40 moves.\n\nThe players will get their second rest day of the event on Friday. There are seven rounds still to be played in the double round robin event that will decide the next challengers for the world championships.\n\nResults round 7 (Indians unless specified):\n\nFirouza Alireza (Fra, 2.5) beat D Gukesh (4); Hikaru Nakamura (Usa, 3.5) drew with Ian Nepomniachtchi (Fid, 4.5); Nijat Abasov (Aze, 2) drew with Vidit Gujrathi (3.5) Fabiano Caruana (Usa, 4) drew with R Praggnanandhaa (4).\n\nWomen: Tingjei Lei (Chn, 4) beat R Vaishali (2.5); Anna Muzychuk (Ukr, 2.5) drew with K Humpy (2.5); Aleksandra Goryachkina (Fid, 4.5) drew with Zhogyi Tan (Chn, 5); Kateryna Lagno (Fid, 4) drew with Nurgyul Salimova (Bul, 3).",

        "text": "Oil prices rose on Friday on the back of heightened tension in the Middle East, amid fears that wider conflict would hinder output from the region.\n\nHowever, a price drop is predicted over the next few weeks as fewer US interest rate cuts are expected this year.\n\nBrent, the benchmark for two thirds of the world's oil, was trading at $90.21 a barrel at 9:00am UAE time. West Texas Intermediate, the gauge that tracks US crude, traded at $85.60 a barrel.\n\nOn Thursday, Opec held firm to its forecasts for global oil demand and economic growth in 2024 and 2025, with expectations of \"robust\" summer months for the crude market.\n\nThe group has forecast oil demand growth of 2.2 million barrels per day for this year and 1.8 million bpd for 2025, sticking to estimates it has made since February, Opec said in its latest monthly oil market report.\n\n\"Crude oil futures prices continued their upward trajectory in March, driven by increasingly positive sentiments regarding oil market fundamentals, amid an elevated risk premium,\" the group said.\n\nOpec projects the market to record strong activity during the summer months, underpinned by higher demand for transportation fuels and an overall healthy global economy, potentially supported by a more accommodative monetary stance by the US Federal Reserve in the third quarter.\n\nThis upbeat outlook, however, \"warrants careful market monitoring, amid ongoing uncertainties, to ensure a sound and sustainable market balance\", the Vienna-based group said.\n\nOpec also stuck to its global economic growth projections of 2.8 per cent in 2024 and 2.9 per cent in 2025. It previously forecast \"robust\" expansion in economic activity in the second half of this year.\n\n\"Despite some downside risks, the continuation of the momentum seen in the beginning of the year could result in further upside potential for global economic growth in 2024,\" Opec said.\n\n\"It is anticipated that domestic political and geopolitical developments will likely not significantly affect growth momentum.\"\n\nGrowth in the US, the world's biggest economy and top consumer of crude, was slightly revised up to 2.1 per cent for 2024. Projections for the eurozone, Japan, China, India and Brazil were unchanged, while Russia's was upgraded on a stronger economy.\n\n\"There has been a significant decline in inflation across most major economies in recent months, although some have observed relatively sustained headline and core inflation figures in February and March,\" Opec said.\n\n\"The response of central banks to this consistent inflationary trend in the coming months remains uncertain,\" it added. The US Federal Reserve is expected to decide on interest rates in its June meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, oil prices fell on Thursday, as investors braced for an escalation of diffused Middle East tensions following an Israeli air strike that killed relatives of the leader of Hamas and potential hostilities between Israel by Iran.\n\nBrent, the benchmark for two thirds of the world's oil, was down 0.42 per cent to $90.10 a barrel at 5:06pm UAE time. West Texas Intermediate, the gauge that tracks US crude, was trading 0.65 per cent lower at $85.65 a barrel.\n\nCrude began the day trading up and held steady near six-month highs before paring gains.\n\nBoth contracts gained more than 1 per cent at the end of Wednesday trading after an Israeli air strike killed a number of children and grandchildren of the Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nIsrael and Iran, meanwhile, have traded threats. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said on Wednesday that his country will retaliate against Iranian territory if it is attacked.\n\nMr Katz made the public warning in posts on X directed at Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, shortly after the Iranian leader said Israel was an \"evil regime\" that \"must be punished\" for a deadly attack on the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus on April 1.\n\nOil prices started the week lower as talks between Hamas and Israel to end the war in Gaza took place in Cairo, but they have hit a stalemate as Hamas has reportedly raised several objections to proposals.\n\nDisagreements over the return of displaced Palestinians in Gaza and vague language on the absence of guarantees for a permanent ceasefire are stumbling blocks in the truce talks, sources told The National on Wednesday.\n\n\"The current geopolitical environment continues to provide support to oil prices,\" analysts at Amsterdam-based ING Group wrote on Thursday.\n\nThe oil market also has to contend with two key data points from the US - inflation and crude stockpiles.\n\nUS inflation increased again last month, dampening hopes that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in June, and also signalling higher-for-longer rates in the UAE and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index rose 0.4 per cent in March, unchanged from its monthly gain in February, the Labour Department reported on Wednesday. But it rose on an annual basis at 3.5 per cent, a larger increase than the 3.2 per cent yearly rise in February.\n\nMeanwhile, inventories of US crude, gasoline and distillates climbed last week on low crude exports, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.\n\nCrude inventories jumped by 5.8 million barrels to 457.3 million barrels in the week ended April 5, way above a Reuters poll of analyst expectations for a 2.4 million barrel increase, the Washington-based EIA said.\n\nOil prices recorded gains after the economic reports were published.\n\nInvestors will also be looking for clues from another report from the International Energy Agency due on Friday.\n\nOpec+ made no policy changes following an online meeting last Wednesday, implying that voluntary output cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day would remain in place until the end of June.\n\nIt also said it would continue to \"closely assess\" market conditions and that member countries were ready to take additional measures if required. A full ministerial gathering will be held in Vienna in June.\n\n\"We continue to anticipate that market conditions this summer will allow for some of the voluntary Opec production cuts to be unwound, but this should be a gradual process. Hence, we still look for a modest decline in prices toward the end of the year,\" analysts at Swiss bank UBS said.",

He shared his opinion in an interview with Kabar news agency.\n\nThe head of state noted that everyone supports the proposals on development of the Kyrgyz language. No one is against it. But Nurlanbek Shakiev's words about Russian and English languages are his personal opinion.\n\nThe state policy is completely different, Sadyr Japarov said. Russian and English are world languages.\n\n\"There are Russian and English among the official languages of the UN. It is impossible to work in CIS countries without Russian. When making official visits, not only to the Commonwealth states, but also to some European countries, the United States and a number of others, speakers speak Russian and listen to simultaneous translation in this language. I have seen this many times in the last three years. And English is used all over the world. I always say to the Minister of Education: \"If possible, look for teachers who teach in two languages,\" he said.\n\nThe president believes it would be good if one teacher taught in Russian and English, without increasing the number of teachers. Kyrgyzstan needs Russian language teachers, especially in rural areas.\n\n\"I haven't heard our children speaking Russian since the childhood. On the contrary, there are cases when students leave school without knowing a word in Russian and go to Russia. They go there, and they have problems with the language. That is why I personally took the initiative and asked Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin) to build nine Russian-language schools for us. Construction work will begin soon,\" he said.\n\nIf there are those who want to build an English-language school, the door is always open, Sadyr Japarov said.\n\nHe believes it would be good if our young people could speak five languages fluently instead of three. The more languages the people know, the broader their outlook and worldview will be. They will learn the customs, set of mind and knowledge of many nations, the head of state said.\n\nWe need to look at the world more broadly, he said. The Kyrgyz language will never die. It will develop and live forever.\n\n\"We should thank God. How can we say that our language is in the same state as it was in the 90s? In the 90s, there were people in our villages who did not speak Kyrgyz. Now, on the contrary, the vast majority of people in the regions do not speak Russian. The reason is that there are not enough Russian language teachers in the villages. Without Russian and English, our young people will not be able to go beyond Kyrgyzstan.\n\nTherefore, we should never be against other languages. Of course, we pay special attention to Kyrgyz. Could it, which was not lost in the past, be lost now? As for Arabic names, it is everyone's business how to name their children. The main thing is to remain Kyrgyz in your heart and soul. For example, we also have the name Mohammed. We have a lot of similar names,\" Sadyr Japarov concluded.",

Following the bitter ending of the 12-year rule of Macky Sall, highlighted by the widespread belief that France is at the heart of Senegal's misery, a forlorn country enthusiastically lapped up Faye's promise of a future untainted by French shenanigans.\n\nAt a stage, it was not clear who was the public enemy #1: Sall or France?\n\nSall started well. He came to office in 2012 with solid credentials, looking every inch like what Senegal needed to break away from the incompetence and cronyism of Abdoulaye Wade under whom the country had lost its way.\n\nSall was an elite with a strong connection to the grassroots. He rallied the opposition against Wade, including committing the unthinkable sin of breaking off from the ruling Parti Democratique Senegalaise, PDS, under which he served as minister. He even dragged the president's son to account before parliament.\n\nSenegalese applauded. After only a few years as president Sall offered to reduce his own term to set an example, but the country said over its dead body. If Senegal could not afford to crown him for life, he must complete his two-term limit of seven years each.\n\nIt's a decision it would later regret. The country had to drag Sall through an economy in a shambles, a country falling apart, and over one dozen dead in street protests to get him out of office. By this time, he had already exceeded his constitutional term limit. Sall, in short, became the very thing that he campaigned against.\n\nFrance as dirty word\n\nAnd France? That's a different story. From Mali to Burkina Faso and from Guinea to Niger, France has become a dirty word, even though the elite in these countries are too ashamed to admit there's nothing France has done without their helping hand. France is not just a metaphor for underdevelopment. You'll be forgiven to think it's probably also the reason some formerly virile folks in the former colonies have lost their libido. It's not a laughing matter.\n\nFaye's inauguration address on April 2 was applauded because in a continent blighted by incompetent gerontocrats he is, at 44, the youngest president in Senegal's 63-year history. But his speech was just as important. To say \"enough\" to France a fric- a perversion of FranceAfrique the harmless slogan of cooperation - that has made French West Africa France's cash machine was a big deal. And Faye said it somewhat elegantly.\n\nSall is past tense. But promising Senegalese a future outside the grip of France, a grip forged decades before Faye was born, is where the tyre meets the road. It's an ambitious promise made not based on where Senegal is today, but on where it wishes to be.\n\nDialing back to Senghor\n\nLet's dial back. Like a number of colonies, especially the French ones, Senegal was a part of France, in law and spirit. Senegal's first President Leopold Sedar Senghor and an in-law of France, was one of the nine African deputies at the Constituent Assembly in Paris in 1945 that prepared the constitution of the Fourth Republic, which brought de Gaulle to power.\n\nThat constitution, according to Martin Meredith's The Fortunes of Africa, \"endorsed the emphasis it placed on the 'indivisible' nature of the Union Francaise,\" a union which of course included Francophone West Africa.\n\nAnyone in doubt about the value of Union Francaise, need to be reminded that when de Gaulle died in 1970, Emperor Jean-Bedel Bokassa of the Central African Republic wept at the funeral of the man he fondly called \"Papa.\" Guinea's Sekou Toure was the exception to Francophone West Africa's mushy-mushy.\n\nAt independence, even though Senegal was better off than a number of other countries, it still relied heavily on French subsidies to pay its bills. Of course, things have changed somewhat in the last six decades, but only somewhat.\n\nOn the day that Faye took his oath of office, pledging to cut French wings to size, France remained the largest exporter to Senegal with goods such as medicines, wheat, and copper wire. In the last 27 years, France exports to Senegal have increased at an annual rate of 3.39 percent from $461 million in 1995 to $1.1 billion in 2022.\n\nOf course, Nigeria, Morocco, and Ghana are also popping up on the radar, with Senegal's intra-African trade growing by about eight percent but it would take more than a passionate inauguration speech to topple French interest, also deeply embedded in the oil and gas sectors by key businesses such as Total (formerly Elf), or BNP Paribas and Societe Generale in the financial services.\n\nScapegoating France?\n\nIs it even necessary to scapegoat France? Of course, it's the popular thing and perennial French greed, not to mention the arrogance and condescension of its last two presidents, have not helped matters. But beyond red-meat politics, why should the average Senegalese be given the impression that once France - and all things French - is out of the way, the country would be on its way to a life of happily ever after?\n\nFaye and those in his corner would soon find that the truth is more nuanced. In today's world, capital or investment is not monolingual. Whether it's French, English, Arabic or Mandarin capital, it finds a home wherever it is made welcome, wherever it can find value.\n\nIt's not a matter of patriotic convenience, for example, that Abu Dhabi has conquered European football clubs and real estate. Britain, France, Germany and other European countries where the Emirati kingdom is invested made them feel welcome, whatever the right-wing sentiments in these countries may be.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, this same kingdom, not far from the region where the West likes to call the Axis of Evil, bought the Chrysler Building, one of the most iconic features of the New York skyline, for $800 million! And surely, Faye knows that for all its sabre-rattling against China nearly three percent of US foreign debt is owed to China.\n\nEven though Senegal's intra-African trade profile is looking up, CFA franc, which is still tied to the French treasury, remains the currency of Francophone countries. Plans by the 15-member regional block, ECOWAS, to adopt a single currency since 1987, have gone nowhere. Similarly, Kenyan President William Ruto's call for a pan-African payment system that would settle intra-African trade outside the dollar has gone nowhere.\n\nFaye's homework\n\nFor Faye to promise freedom from French grip on French money, French medicines and French food, is wishful thinking. The work must start from home, from within. The country must heal after the roller-coaster transition and also take steps to restore tourists' confidence. Faye's government needs to tackle corruption, strengthen the justice system, and help farmers deal with the impact of climate change.\n\nThere's no need to demonise France. A strategic reset of Senegal's relationship with Paris can begin with Dakar creating an environment that works for investment - wherever it is coming from - while the new government also leverages regional cooperation, especially with moderate Francophone countries in the region.\n\nAnd the country is not doing too badly in casting its net wide. China, Russia and India are following closely behind France as Senegal's deep-pocket trading partners. Investments from these destinations may not speak French but they may just be as unserviceable as those from Paris or elsewhere if Faye does not create the right environment for them to thrive.\n\nThe political campaign is over: governance is where the tyre meets the road.",

        "title": "LIBYA: Libya April Update",
        "text": "April 12, 2024: Turkish Airlines resumed scheduled flights to Libya at Tripoli in late March 2024. Turkish flight service stopped in 2015 because of growing violence in the country. Resumption of scheduled airline operations makes it possible for Libyan and foreign businesses to operate efficiently. Currently Turkish Airlines provides three flights a week, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays, between Istanbul and Tripoli. This schedule is designed to be convenient for commercial travelers. Flights take place at the recently refurbished Mitiga International Airport in Tripoli.\n\nBesides Turkey, Russia also benefits from the new air service. Turkey and Russia have both been involved in Libyan affairs for years. Unfortunately, Turkey and Russia could not agree on what was best for Libya and each adopted their own relationship with Libya.\n\nRussia had no past experience in Libya while Turkey did. While the past Turkish relationship was that of a foreign conqueror, over the last few years the Turks had turned that into an advantage. Turkey continues to maintain Syrian mercenary military forces in Libya and those will until 2026 or later. The Turks block efforts to hold national elections and bring an end to twelve years of civil war.\n\nThis began in 2020 when the Turks had sent enough troops to rescue the GNA (Government of National Accord), a failed UN and Moslem Brotherhood backed government. The GNA failed to attract a national following and was still confronted by a Libyan military leader, General Haftar, who formed the LNA (Libyan National Army). This is a force of trained and disciplined Libyan soldiers in eastern Libya with a capital in Tobruk. Haftar was doing what UN diplomacy and threats could not. The LNA has been around since 2015, when it was formed in eastern Libya and proceeded to eliminate rivals, especially Islamic radical groups, throughout the country. In early 2019 all that the GNA had left was Tripoli, the traditional capital and to the east the coastal city of Misrata with its port facilities and functional airport. Both cities are dominated by dozens of rival militias, many of them seeking an Islamic government but mainly looking out for themselves. The LNA went after Tripoli in early 2019, from two sides and slowly pushed back the desperate militias, who would lose their independence and lucrative criminal enterprises if the LNA succeeded. The UN condemned the LNA and ignored Turkey shipping in weapons and military advisors to assist the GNA. By the end of 2019 Turkey was threatening to, and did, send in combat troops and warships to blockade Libyan ports. This Turkish support violated the UN arms embargo on Libya, as did the military support Russia, Egypt, the UAE (United Arab Emirates) and a few other countries provided to the LNA. The LNA agreed to a ceasefire and national elections. The Turks and their thousands of mercenaries are still there and prepared to stay indefinitely.\n\nEgypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and possibly France have reportedly aided Haftar's forces, while Qatar has supported Tripoli's forces and Italy has supported the Tripoli faction politically. The involvement of these foreign countries makes it hard for those Libyans who want a genuine Libyan solution to prevail. If a unity government were to emerge, such foreign forces undoubtedly would come under greater scrutiny and face political pressure to leave. Hence, the presence of these foreign forces helps to perpetuate the country's political divisions.\n\nIf all this were not bad enough, in September 2023 there was an unexpected flood when a large storm filled Libyan reservoirs with more water than two dams could handle. The dams collapsed and caused a flood of water that raced to the sea and killed over eight thousand and left neatly 50,000 homeless. The two dams were allegedly built to withstand the stress that caused them to collapse. Questions were asked and it was discovered that money the government was supposed to spend on maintaining the dams was diverted to other uses by corrupt officials who stole much of the dam support funds. None of the political factions would accept responsibility for these problems or even support an investigation. That included expediting the issuance of death certificates so family members could claim survivor pensions after the loss of family members.\n\nThe government Prosecutor's Office began a criminal investigation into the dam disaster, and eight officials were eventually arrested but no prosecutions followed. Meanwhile, foreign NGOs (Non-government Organizations) supplied shelter, clean water, food, and medical treatment for hundreds of thousands of Libyans. Libya is a country with a small population and large oil income. Libya also has a culture of corruption. Those who can steal government funds do so and leave Libya for a country where they can enjoy their stolen wealth and cannot be extradited in the future and prosecuted.\n\nThis downward spiral began in 2011 when the decades-long Muammar Gaddafi dictatorship was overthrown, and no stable national government emerged to replace the dictatorship. Two separate governments soon appeared but spent most of their time fighting the other government and seeking to control some of the oil production. Money from oil sales keeps this civil war going and there is no end in sight. Meanwhile, most Libyans are living in poverty. To make matters worse, local, and Italian criminal gangs have organized a lucrative business to serve foreign migrants who want to get to Europe and pay for transportation. A lot of migrants reach the coast without money to pay for passage and are stranded. The two Libyan governments arrange for the African migrants to return to the country they came from. Otherwise, these stranded migrants would starve, be arrested, or killed for stealing to survive.",

The United Nations voiced alarm Thursday at the junta's move to suspend political activities.\n\nMali's ruling military junta on Thursday banned media coverage of political parties a day after suspending their activities, marking the latest crackdown on dissent in the West African nation.\n\nOpposition voices have been largely stifled since the colonels seized power in a 2020 coup, overthrowing civilian president Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.\n\nMali's high authority for communication issued a statement Thursday calling on \"all media (radio, television, written press and online) to halt broadcast and publication of the activities of political parties and the activities of a political nature of associations\".\n\nIt did not indicate what would happen to media organisations that did not observe the ban.\n\nThe move comes after authorities on Wednesday ordered the indefinite suspension of all political activities, saying it was needed to maintain public order.\n\nGovernment spokesman Colonel Abdoulaye Maiga blamed the suspension of party activities on the \"sterile discussions\" during an attempt at national dialogue earlier this year.\n\n\"Subversive acts by political parties are multiplying,\" a decree read out to reporters by Maiga said.\n\nHe added that the fight against armed jihadist and Tuareg separatist groups could not be reconciled by \"sterile political debates\".\n\nThe latest crackdown has prompted numerous comments on social media but there has so far been little reaction from parties or leading figures, already largely silenced.\n\nMoussa Mara, who was prime minister from 2014 until 2015, urged authorities to reverse the decision, calling it a \"major step backwards\" that \"does not promise a peaceful future\".\n\nThe president of the Convergence for the Development of Mali (CODEM) party, Housseini Amion Guindo, called for \"civil disobedience until the fall of the illegal and illegitimate regime... due in particular to its inability to satisfy the essential needs of Malians\".\n\nUnder pressure from regional bloc ECOWAS, the junta had promised to hold elections and hand power back to civilians by March 26, 2024, but no vote was organised.\n\nThe United Nations voiced alarm Thursday at the junta's move to suspend political activities.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned by the decree suspending the activities of political parties and other civic associations,\" the UN rights office said on X, formerly Twitter, insisting that \"it must be immediately repealed\".\n\n- 'Return to the barracks' -\n\nSince August 2020, Mali's opposition has been largely muzzled by legal woes, the dissolution of organisations, restrictions on press freedom and calls for national unity.\n\nBut in a rare joint statement on March 31, a number of political parties and civil groups decried the \"legal and institutional vacuum\" left by the failure to hand back power to civilians on March 26.\n\nThey called for a \"rapid and inclusive dialogue\" to ensure that the presidential election is held \"as soon as possible\".\n\nIn a separate statement on the same day, a group of human rights organisations said that Mali had \"reached an impasse\" and that it was time for the military \"to return to the barracks\".\n\nSince seizing power in 2020, the junta has ended several international alliances, including with the European Union and former colonial power France, and instead fostered closer ties with Russia.\n\nThe military government last year ordered the withdrawal of the UN stabilisation mission MINUSMA, and in January ended a 2015 peace agreement with separatist groups in the north.\n\nThe worsening security situation in Mali has also been compounded by a humanitarian and political crisis.\n\nNeighbouring Sahel states Burkina Faso and Niger also underwent military coups in 2022 and 2023 respectively.\n\nThe three countries have all pledged to leave ECOWAS in favour of their own Sahel alliance.",

In the US, rents have something close to a weight of 35 per cent in the CPI [consumer price index], whereas in Australia it's about 6 per cent.\n\n\"Even though rents are rapidly rising here, they're not going to have anywhere near the same effect they have in the US.\"\n\nDr Oliver also said households in Australia were feeling the pain of high interest rates due to the dominance of variable-rate loans, whereas consumers in the US were still \"alive and well\".\n\nWhile Australian households had cut back on spending, Westpac chief economist Luci Ellis said per capita consumption in the US was increasing, in large part because of the Biden administration's loose spending.\n\n\"In the United States, the federal government is running a budget deficit of around 6 per cent of GDP, with no consolidation in sight or even being seriously discussed,\" Dr Ellis said.\n\n\"Income tax brackets are indexed to the CPI, so American households are not seeing that drag from higher tax payments.\n\n\"Together with the fact that average mortgage rates paid have risen far less in the United States, macro policy is barely touching the sides for the US consumer.\"\n\nDr Ellis said the Albanese government's more prudent budget policy was helping the RBA to take heat out of the economy and negated the need for further monetary tightening.\n\n\"While there is still a body of opinion holding that the RBA will not cut rates until 2025, a number of customers overseas ... are more likely to ask what would trigger the RBA to cut rates earlier than our current call for a late-September timing,\" she said.\n\nThe National Australia Bank business survey released this week showed falls in labour costs, purchase costs, and buying and selling prices, which Dr Oliver said implied a further decline in inflation in Australia.",

I say this because many earlier equations are collapsing. Earlier, it was Muslims and Christians for the UDF while Ezhavas and other Hindus for the CPI(M).

He accused the Congress and the CPI(M) of \"unleashing a misinformation campaign\" about it in Kerala.\n\nListing the benefits extended to people by the BJP government, Javadekar said, \"Modiji doesn't discriminate,\" while the LDF and the UDF choose their loyalists, favourites, and cadres for extending benefits.\n\nHe said all sections of Kerala society including Muslims and Christians are happy with the Modi government because of the development works undertaken by it in the state, including the introduction of Vande Bharat trains and the rapid completion of National Highways.\n\nIn reaching out to the families of expatriates, he noted that Indians living abroad are very happy because India's stature has risen in geopolitics due to PM Modi's diplomacy.

        "text": "Washington, DC [US], April 12 (ANI): The United States' defence commitments to Japan and the Philippines are \"ironclad,\" US President Joe Biden said on Thursday as he hosted the first-ever trilateral summit between the three countries, welcoming Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr to the White House a day after the official visit of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, CNN reported.\n\nThe US-Japan-Philippines trilateral comes after the creation of groupings in the Indo-Pacific, starting with the Quad, comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan, and the AUKUS, consisting of Australia, the US and the UK, amid increasing concerns over China's military muscle-flexing in the region.\n\n\"When we stand as one, we're able to forge a better future for all,\" Biden said in the East Room of the White House Thursday.\n\nAccording to CNN, tensions between the Philippines and China have been focused on the Second Thomas Shoal, situated approximately 200 kilometres off the coast of Palawan, Philippines. In the 1990s, the Philippines intentionally grounded an aging World War II-era navy transport ship on the shoal to reinforce its territorial claim. The ship is now mostly a rusted wreckage and is manned by Filipino marines stationed on rotation.\n\nMeanwhile, China asserts sovereignty over the shoal, located within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, as part of its broader claims in the South China Sea, disregarding an international arbitration ruling.\n\nRecent clashes have occurred when Philippine attempts to resupply the forces on the ship have been met by China Coast Guard ships firing water cannons at the Philippine resupply boats, resulting in injuries to Filipino sailors and damage to the vessels, as per CNN.\n\nBiden said on Thursday, referencing the Filipino-Chinese tensions, that \"any attack on Philippine aircraft, vessels or armed forces in the South China Sea would invoke our mutual defence treaty.\"The 1951 mutual defence treaty between the US and the Philippines, the oldest of its kind in the Asia-Pacific region, obligates both nations to come to each other's defence in the event of an attack by a third party.\n\nThursday's meeting signifies the administration's ongoing efforts to address Chinese aggression, with a senior administration official expressing deep concern over China's actions in the South China Sea, and affirming at the head of the meeting that the White House is very concerned by China's actions in the South China Sea.\n\n\"What you'll see is a clear demonstration of support and resolve from both President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida that we stand shoulder to shoulder with Marcos, ready to support and work with the Philippines at every turn,\" one official said ahead of Thursday's meeting.\n\nMarcos said on Thursday that the Philippines, Japan and the United States \"meet today as friends and partners bound by a shared vision in pursuit of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.\"The three countries, Marcos added, are \"linked by a profound respect for democracy, good governance and the rule of law.\"The meeting coincides with heightened concerns over China's assertive stance towards Taiwan and the South China Sea, coupled with nuclear provocations from North Korea and its evolving ties with Russia. These concerns have prompted regional allies to draw closer to the US.\n\nJapan has emerged as a focal point in President Biden's efforts to strengthen alliances in the Indo-Pacific. Prime Minister Kishida has been viewed as a cooperative partner, having made significant adjustments to Japan's defence strategy in recent years. Additionally, Japan has provided ongoing support to Ukraine in the wake of Russia's invasion, demonstrating its commitment to international security. Kishida has pledged to increase defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP by 2037 and has bolstered Japan's counterstrike capabilities by acquiring American Tomahawk missiles.\n\nBiden hosted Marcos at the White House last year, showing his intent to reestablish strong ties with Manila that had frayed under former President Rodrigo Duterte, who sought closer relations with China.\n\n\"We're going to continue to support the Philippines military's modernization goals,\" Biden told the visiting leader during that visit, pledging the two nations \"not only share a strong partnership, we share a deep friendship, one that has been enriched by millions of Filipino Americans in the communities all across the United States.\"A highlight of Thursday's meeting was several announcements meant to bolster the Philippines.\n\nA senior administration official also said that on Thursday, the White House will be announcing a new infrastructure project in the Philippines. CNN reported earlier this week that one of the announcements will be the development of a new rail and shipping corridor between the Philippines's Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base, a move that's meant to send a clear message to Beijing.\n\nBiden briefly referenced that economic corridor on Thursday: \"It means more jobs for people across the entire region,\" he said. \"It means more investment in sectors critical to our future: clean energy, ports, railroads, agriculture and much more.\"The White House is also expected to increase the Filipino military's capability with a new infrastructure investment similar to what the US announced in India in the lead-up to the G20.\n\nIn the days leading up to the summit, the US, Japan and the Philippines along with Australia, conducted maritime military exercises near the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), after Philippine vessels had alleged \"harassment\" by Chinese ships in the South China Sea.\n\nThe senior official added that the White House will also be making announcements about \"Open Radio Access Network technology\" and that both the US and Japan will be providing millions of dollars in funding.\n\nOfficials also said they will announce an upcoming Coast Guard patrol in the Indo-Pacific that will take place \"in the coming year.\" (ANI)",

        "text": "Libya overtook Nigeria to emerge top African crude oil producer for the month of March, data from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has shown.\n\nAccording to the April 2024 Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR) published by the oil cartel, Libya recorded 1.24 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude production in March, a 5.7 increase from 1.17 million bpd in February.\n\nBut Nigeria recorded an output of 1.23 bpd in March to 1.32 million bpd in February. The April output figure represented the lowest production rate the nation has recorded since July 2023.\n\nThe drop of almost 91,000 barrels per day, according to direct communications from OPEC underscores the difficulties the Nigerian oil sector faces, such as limited infrastructure, security breaches in oil-producing areas, and operational hiccups.\n\nExperts said large-scale oil theft from pipelines and wells has been one of President Bola Tinubu's biggest challenges in recent years, damaging government finances and limiting the country's output and exports.\n\n\"We aren't curbing oil theft nor are we taking or making quick wins at our Wells that need to be boosted or optimised,\" Jide Pratt, country manager at Trade Grid and an energy analyst.\n\n\"We have lost another 100,000 bpd; what are Gabon, Saudi and Kuwait doing that we need to copy to increase production?\" he asked.\n\nLast month, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC Ltd) appealed to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to help tackle the menace of crude oil theft in the country.\n\nSpeaking about the efforts by NNPC Ltd to eradicate corruption from its system and stem crude oil theft and pipeline vandalism, Mele Kyari, the group chief executive officer of the company contended that going by the volume of oil stolen daily and the brazenness with which the perpetrators operate, crude oil theft was the most humongous and virulent economic crime in Nigeria that must attract the attention of the EFCC.\n\n\"As we continue to do our best to deepen transparency and stamp out corruption from the system, there is one big challenge that you will need to help us with.\n\nThat challenge is crude theft,\" Kyari appealed at an interactive session with Ola Olukoyede at the NNPC Towers in Abuja.\n\nIn recent years, Nigeria has recorded a surge in pipeline vandalism and crude oil theft incidents in its oil-producing region, a development that worsened the nation's revenue challenge.\n\nTo curb crude theft, the NNPC Ltd launched an application in August 2022 to monitor the incidence of theft and vandalism. The NNPC Ltd also awarded a multibillion naira pipeline surveillance and procurement to a former leader of the Movement for the Emancipation of Niger Delta, Government Ekpemupolo.\n\nDespite such initiatives, Nigeria continues to experience significant oil losses to vandals, prompting several international oil companies to shift from the onshore sector to offshore.\n\nExperts said the reduction in Nigeria's crude oil production coincides with production cuts being implemented by OPEC and its allies, notably Russia, in an effort to stabilise the world oil markets and maintain prices.\n\nTo guarantee that agreed-upon quotas are being followed, the OPEC+ group, headed by Saudi Arabia, has been closely watching the output levels of its members.",

        "title": "US vows 'ironclad' defence of Philippines, Japan amid growing China provocations",
        "text": "Washington, DC [US], April 12 (ANI): The United States' defence commitments to Japan and the Philippines are \"ironclad,\" US President Joe Biden said on Thursday as he hosted the first-ever trilateral summit between the three countries, welcoming Filipino President Ferdinand Marcos Jr to the White House a day after the official visit of Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, CNN reported.\n\nThe US-Japan-Philippines trilateral comes after the creation of groupings in the Indo-Pacific, starting with the Quad, comprising India, the US, Australia and Japan, and the AUKUS, consisting of Australia, the US and the UK, amid increasing concerns over China's military muscle-flexing in the region.\n\n\"When we stand as one, we're able to forge a better future for all,\" Biden said in the East Room of the White House Thursday.\n\nAccording to CNN, tensions between the Philippines and China have been focused on the Second Thomas Shoal, situated approximately 200 kilometres off the coast of Palawan, Philippines. In the 1990s, the Philippines intentionally grounded an aging World War II-era navy transport ship on the shoal to reinforce its territorial claim. The ship is now mostly a rusted wreckage and is manned by Filipino marines stationed on rotation.\n\nMeanwhile, China asserts sovereignty over the shoal, located within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, as part of its broader claims in the South China Sea, disregarding an international arbitration ruling.\n\nRecent clashes have occurred when Philippine attempts to resupply the forces on the ship have been met by China Coast Guard ships firing water cannons at the Philippine resupply boats, resulting in injuries to Filipino sailors and damage to the vessels, as per CNN.\n\nBiden said on Thursday, referencing the Filipino-Chinese tensions, that \"any attack on Philippine aircraft, vessels or armed forces in the South China Sea would invoke our mutual defence treaty.\"The 1951 mutual defence treaty between the US and the Philippines, the oldest of its kind in the Asia-Pacific region, obligates both nations to come to each other's defence in the event of an attack by a third party.\n\nThursday's meeting signifies the administration's ongoing efforts to address Chinese aggression, with a senior administration official expressing deep concern over China's actions in the South China Sea, and affirming at the head of the meeting that the White House is very concerned by China's actions in the South China Sea.\n\n\"What you'll see is a clear demonstration of support and resolve from both President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida that we stand shoulder to shoulder with Marcos, ready to support and work with the Philippines at every turn,\" one official said ahead of Thursday's meeting.\n\nMarcos said on Thursday that the Philippines, Japan and the United States \"meet today as friends and partners bound by a shared vision in pursuit of a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific.\"The three countries, Marcos added, are \"linked by a profound respect for democracy, good governance and the rule of law.\"The meeting coincides with heightened concerns over China's assertive stance towards Taiwan and the South China Sea, coupled with nuclear provocations from North Korea and its evolving ties with Russia. These concerns have prompted regional allies to draw closer to the US.\n\nJapan has emerged as a focal point in President Biden's efforts to strengthen alliances in the Indo-Pacific. Prime Minister Kishida has been viewed as a cooperative partner, having made significant adjustments to Japan's defence strategy in recent years. Additionally, Japan has provided ongoing support to Ukraine in the wake of Russia's invasion, demonstrating its commitment to international security. Kishida has pledged to increase defence spending to 2 per cent of GDP by 2037 and has bolstered Japan's counterstrike capabilities by acquiring American Tomahawk missiles.\n\nBiden hosted Marcos at the White House last year, showing his intent to reestablish strong ties with Manila that had frayed under former President Rodrigo Duterte, who sought closer relations with China.\n\n\"We're going to continue to support the Philippines military's modernization goals,\" Biden told the visiting leader during that visit, pledging the two nations \"not only share a strong partnership, we share a deep friendship, one that has been enriched by millions of Filipino Americans in the communities all across the United States.\"A highlight of Thursday's meeting was several announcements meant to bolster the Philippines.\n\nA senior administration official also said that on Thursday, the White House will be announcing a new infrastructure project in the Philippines. CNN reported earlier this week that one of the announcements will be the development of a new rail and shipping corridor between the Philippines's Clark Air Base and Subic Naval Base, a move that's meant to send a clear message to Beijing.\n\nBiden briefly referenced that economic corridor on Thursday: \"It means more jobs for people across the entire region,\" he said. \"It means more investment in sectors critical to our future: clean energy, ports, railroads, agriculture and much more.\"The White House is also expected to increase the Filipino military's capability with a new infrastructure investment similar to what the US announced in India in the lead-up to the G20.\n\nIn the days leading up to the summit, the US, Japan and the Philippines along with Australia, conducted maritime military exercises near the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), after Philippine vessels had alleged \"harassment\" by Chinese ships in the South China Sea.\n\nThe senior official added that the White House will also be making announcements about \"Open Radio Access Network technology\" and that both the US and Japan will be providing millions of dollars in funding.\n\nOfficials also said they will announce an upcoming Coast Guard patrol in the Indo-Pacific that will take place \"in the coming year.\" (ANI)",

        "title": "EXPLAINER-Sudan's conflict: Who is backing the rival commanders? | Law-Order",
        "text": "Since the war started, Egypt has received Burhan and his representatives on visits and has launched a peace process involving Sudan's neighbours that ran in parallel with mediation efforts led by the United States, Saudi Arabia and African regional grouping IGAD. It has joined calls for an effective ceasefire while saying it considers the conflict an internal matter for Sudan.\n\nAs a devastating conflict has unfolded across Sudan over the past year, the country's military rivals have sought support from foreign backers as they try to tip the contest in their favour.\n\nThat backing risks widening and prolonging the war between the Sudanese armed forces, led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) headed by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, commonly known as Hemedti. The influence of outside players has loomed over events in Sudan since the overthrow of former leader Omar al-Bashir during a popular uprising five years ago.\n\nWHO SUPPORTS BURHAN? Burhan's clearest ally has been Egypt, which shares a border with Sudan that more than 500,000 people have crossed since the fighting began.\n\nIn both countries, the military has assumed a dominant role in the decades since independence and has intervened following popular uprisings - in Egypt when former army chief Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi led the ousting of democratically elected President Mohamed Mursi a decade ago, and in Sudan when Burhan led a military takeover in 2021. Since the war started, Egypt has received Burhan and his representatives on visits and has launched a peace process involving Sudan's neighbours that ran in parallel with mediation efforts led by the United States, Saudi Arabia and African regional grouping IGAD.\n\nIt has joined calls for an effective ceasefire while saying it considers the conflict an internal matter for Sudan. Another country that neighbours areas of Sudan controlled by the army and where Burhan has sought to shore up regional support is Eritrea, one of his first stops when he resumed foreign trips last year.\n\nSince late 2023, sources say\n\nthe army has also drawn on material support from Iran, including Iranian-made drones that helped it make significant gains in Omdurman, part of Sudan's wider capital. Sudan's acting foreign minister, who is aligned with the army and visited Tehran this year as diplomatic ties that had been cut in 2016 were restored, denied weapons had been received.\n\nFrom further afield, Ukrainian special forces have intervened on the army's side to counter alleged support for the RSF from Russian mercenary group Wagner, according to several reports in Ukrainian and international media. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy held an\n\nimpromptu meeting with Burhan in Ireland in September to discuss \"illegal armed groups financed by Russia\".\n\nWHO SUPPORTS HEMEDTI? For several years, Hemedti's most important ally has been the United Arab Emirates, Sudanese sources, analysts and diplomats say.\n\nThe UAE has aggressively sought to roll back Islamist influence across the region, intervening in conflicts in countries including Libya and Yemen. Hemedti has presented himself as a bulwark against Islamist-leaning factions that established deep roots in the army and other institutions under Bashir. U.N. experts say reports that the UAE has sent arms to the RSF through eastern Chad are \"credible\", and that sources in Chad and Darfur reported cargo planes had delivered the weapons and ammunition several times a week.\n\nThe UAE has denied making any such shipments and has said its role in Sudan is focused on humanitarian support and calls for de-escalation. The UAE has also provided Hemedti, who grew rich through the gold trade, with a platform for channelling his finances as well as public relations support for the RSF, according to Andreas Krieg, Associate Professor at King's College, London.\n\nIn a report published in January, the U.N. experts said the RSF, which has fostered tribal alliances stretching across Sudan's western borders, brought weapons into Sudan from Libya and the Central African Republic, and fuel from South Sudan. Before the war broke out, Hemedti had cultivated ties with Russia. Western diplomats in Khartoum said in 2022 that Russia's Wagner Group was involved in illicit gold mining in Sudan and was spreading disinformation. Hemedti said he advised Sudan to cut ties with Wagner after the U.S. imposed sanctions on the military contractor. Wagner said last year that it was no longer operating in Sudan.\n\nWHICH OTHER POWERS HAVE INFLUENCE? Saudi Arabia had close ties to Burhan and Hemedti dating to before the war. Both men were involved in sending Sudanese troops to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.\n\nAs it steps up its diplomatic ambitions across the Middle East, Riyadh has asserted itself in mediating over Sudan while also looking to protect its economic ambitions in the Red Sea region, said Anna Jacobs, Senior Gulf Analyst with Crisis Group. \"Saudi Arabia is focused on Red Sea security, which is integral to Saudi Vision 2030 and investments along the Red Sea like Neom,\" she said, referring to the futuristic city backed by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the United States led unsuccessful efforts last year to negotiate a ceasefire in Sudan. East African powers Ethiopia and Kenya also hold some sway due to their prominent role in regional diplomacy and previous mediation in Sudan.\n\nSouth Sudan hosted peace talks between the Sudanese state and rebel groups in recent years, and was designated as one of the countries that could host talks over the current crisis. Israel, which had been hoping to move forward in normalizing ties with Sudan, has also offered to host talks.\n\nWHAT IS THE WEST'S POSITION? Before the war, Western powers had belatedly swung behind a transition towards elections as the military shared power with civilians after Bashir's overthrow, offering direct financial support that was frozen when Burhan and Hemedti staged a coup in 2021.\n\nAfter the coup and led by the United States, Western powers supported a new transition deal that ended up triggering the eruption of fighting by creating a stand-off over the future structure of the military. Critics say the U.S. was too lenient with the generals.\n\n\"Their strategy was stability and their basic misconception was that they would get stability by backing the strong and decisive and cohesive players who happened to be in power,\" said Alex de Waal, a Sudan expert and head of the World Peace Foundation at Tufts University.

        "title": "While Biden and Kishida exchange praise in Washington, Japan is asking 'what if Trump'?",
        "text": "Despite warm words from the US and Japanese leaders during their summit this week, back in Japan the spectre of a second Trump White House looms large\n\nJoe Biden was effusive in his praise for Japan and its \"bold\" prime minister, Fumio Kishida, during a state visit that took place this week amid new and growing security threats in the Asia-Pacific, wars in Ukraine and Gaza, and months of political uncertainty ahead for both leaders.\n\nThe first ladies, Jill Biden and Yuko Kishida, exchanged gifts and hugs, there was talk of cherry blossoms and a state banquet menu inspired by Japanese cuisine - and even a half-decent joke from Kishida about the Flintstones.\n\nBut Kishida's speech to Congress on Thursday - only the second by a Japanese leader - was largely short on humour.\n\n\"I detect an undercurrent of self-doubt among some Americans about what your role in the world should be,\" he said. \"The international order that the US worked for generations to build is facing new challenges, challenges from those with values and principles very different from ours.\"\n\nHe was referring to the loose alliance of nations lining up to challenge the US-led hegemony, in Europe in the form of Russia, but also closer to home in northeast Asia, where an increasingly assertive China is causing alarm in the South And East China seas, and a nuclear-armed North Korea sinking deeper into the embrace of a needy Kremlin.\n\nBut Kishida may as well have been referring to another potential threat to the international order and his country's relations with the US - the possible election in November of Donald Trump.\n\nUS-Japan ties - described by the former US ambassador to Japan, Mike Mansfield, as the most important in the world, \"bar none\" - could look very different under a Trump administration.\n\nThe warning signs emerged during his first term, when Trump urged Japan - and Washington's other \"free-loading\" ally in the region, South Korea - to foot more of the bill towards hosting US forces, warning that failure to comply could see those troops removed.\n\nThat never came to pass, but unease about a possible Trump Mark II is running high in Japan, prompting the return to the lexicon of moshitora, or \"What if Trump?\" and a more emphatic follow-up: hobotora - \"almost certainly Trump\".\n\nJapanese attempts to pre-emptively court Trump, and understand what his presidency might mean for Japan, have failed. Taro Aso, a former prime minister, tried unsuccessfully to arrange a meeting earlier this year, according to media reports, while the foreign ministry has mobilised diplomats across the US to analyse any mention of foreign policy the Republican nominee makes during his campaign.\n\nLess than eight months before the presidential election, the indications are that a Trump White House could shake the foundations of the US-Japan security arrangements referred to in such glowing terms by Biden and Kishida.\n\nUnder Kishida, Japan has adhered to the US playbook, vowing to double its defence budget over five years through to 2027 and easing strained ties with its neighbour South Korea, while remaining on message over Russian sanctions. It will develop a next-generation stealth fighter jet with Britain and Italy, and acquire the ability to launch \"counterstrikes\" against enemy targets, presumed to be North Korean missile sites. There is talk, too, of a future role for Tokyo in the Aukus defence partnership alongside the US, Britain and Australia.\n\nA second Trump White House would throw curveballs in Japan's direction, according to his former national security adviser John Bolton, who said recently that his former boss had a \"lack of appreciation for what American alliances do\".\n\nIn policy terms, that could mean rewriting the countries' 1960 security treaty. As president, Trump criticised the \"one-sided\" nature of the US-Japan alliance, because the treaty requires the US to intervene if Japan is attacked but places no reciprocal obligation for its \"pacifist\" ally.\n\n\"Get ready for Trump to say, 'I want the treaty amended so that Japan is also obligated to defend the United States,'\" Bolton said in an interview in March with Nikkei Asia.\n\nAny uncertainty in Tokyo and Seoul over US commitments to the defence of its allies would ramp up the risks in an already unstable region, he added. It would, Bolton said, \"lead, in Japan, in South Korea, and elsewhere, to the question, 'Should we get our own nuclear weapons? If we're not under the US nuclear umbrella, maybe we need our own.'\"\n\nTo complicate the picture, there is no guarantee of political continuity on either side of the Pacific.\n\nWhen he returns to Tokyo this weekend, Kishida will be confronted by the fallout from a funding scandal that has pitted him against the most powerful faction in his ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and sparked speculation about his future.\n\nDespite disciplining dozens of MPs and apologising for the scandal, Kishida's approval rating slumped to 23% in a poll published this week, down two percentage points from last month.\n\nWhile Japan does not have to hold a lower house election until autumn 2025, an LDP defeat in a byelection later this month could further weaken Kishida.\n\n\"LDP lawmakers have already suggested that if the LDP loses ... it could trigger a movement to unseat Kishida in the coming months,\" said Tobias Harris, the founder of Japan Foresight, a political risk advisory firm in Washington.\n\nThe US's commitment to the defence of Japan is \"ironclad\", Biden claimed this week. But look closer, and it is impossible to ignore the signs of danger.",

The plan was to focus instead on the bloc's competitiveness.\n\nForgot something? But after Russian missiles destroyed a key power plant near Kyiv on Thursday, a group of countries is ramping up efforts to bring leaders' focus back onto Ukraine -- including on the need for air defense systems, two EU diplomats told Playbook.\n\nTweaking the draft: This group of staunchly pro-Kyiv countries is pushing to include language on Ukraine in the conclusions of the European Council gathering next week after an initial draft circulated Monday among diplomats didn't mention it.\n\nFeedback: \"It might send the wrong signal if the European Council is seen as not discussing Ukraine given the developments we are seeing,\" said one diplomat who asked not to be named to discuss the non-public deliberations around Council conclusions. Another told Playbook: \"If the EU won't act now, Russia will feel invincible and take our lack of action as a signal that it's OK to destroy.\"\n\n**A message from Planet: Turn the tide on natural disasters. Early warning systems empower authorities to anticipate flood, wildfire, or drought, to preemptively secure vulnerable areas, and to effectively mitigate potential damages. Planet Labs can help arm communities and governments with the insights needed to enhance disaster preparedness and recovery efforts around the globe.**\n\nAir defenses: The last-minute push follows a vote on Thursday in the European Parliament geared at raising pressure on leaders to deliver at least seven Patriot batteries to Ukraine -- the number cited by officials in Kyiv as the absolute minimum to maintain protection of cities and key infrastructure. Read the full story from Eddy Wax and Jacopo Barigazzi.\n\nPlenty lying around: The problem does not appear to be a lack of Patriots in Western arsenals. In a speech earlier this week, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell disclosed that Western armies possess \"about 100\" of them.\n\nIt's more like a lack of will. \"Still, we are not able to provide the seven they are desperately asking for,\" said Borrell.\n\nThe question now: Where are these Patriot batteries, and how long until countries are called out for holding onto them when they face little risk of aerial attack? In a tweet sent late Thursday, Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote cryptically that \"both Kyiv and Paris know where these systems are. Certain decisions can be made quickly. Others require time, but work on them must begin immediately. Urgent action is required.\"\n\nBoost from DC: U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink said Thursday that the United States had signed a deal with Kyiv to provide it with $138 million in critical air defense system upgrades. But given Kuleba's tweet landed more than an hour after Brink's, it seems unlikely these upgrades are sufficient to meet Ukraine's needs.\n\nBottom line: Europe is understandably focused on preparing its future, particularly in the event Donald Trump returns to the White House. But if the EU fails to address Ukraine's immediate challenges, its push for greater autonomy will start to look hollow.\n\nFROZEN ASSETS\n\nCONSENSUS BUILDS ON RUSSIAN ASSETS-FOR-AMMO: Officials are optimistic that there will soon be a deal on the Commission's proposal to use most of the profits generated by Russia's frozen assets to buy weapons for Ukraine. That's a surprise, given how difficult it has previously been to agree on buying weapons for Kyiv, Gregorio Sorgi writes in to report.\n\nVon der Leyen's plan: Today, the dedicated working party will discuss the Commission's proposal to use 90 percent of the profits from Russia's assets to buy weapons for Ukraine, while directing remaining funding for non-military purposes. The EU's end goal is to send the cash to Kyiv by July.\n\nMoscow's friends aren't happy: Several member countries are lukewarm about this plan. Hungary and Slovakia argue handing more weapons to Ukraine will feed into a military escalation.\n\nNor are the neutrals: Non-NATO EU members including Malta, Austria, Cyprus and Ireland are also uncomfortable with the idea of arming Ukraine using the proceeds of the frozen assets. Malta challenged the legality of this move during a technical meeting on Monday. But these grumblings are unlikely to stand in the way of the Commission's proposal, five officials told our colleagues on the Morning Financial Services newsletter.\n\nWhat's next: EU ambassadors will talk frozen assets on Monday. That might be too early to seal a deal, with an EU diplomat saying it could take two rounds of discussions to do that.\n\nMEANWHILE, IN SWITZERLAND: Campaigners backed by the right-wing populist Swiss People's Party gathered enough signatures to trigger a referendum on neutrality that could kill the country's Russia sanctions. The FT has a write-up.\n\nNOW READ THIS: The EU will haul Germany to court unless Berlin revises a controversial gas law that neighboring countries say is harming their efforts to diversify away from Russian energy, my colleagues Victor Jack and Julia Wacket reveal.\n\nPIEPERGATE LATEST\n\nWHERE'S MARKUS? Markus Pieper -- the German center-right MEP and ally of Ursula von der Leyen who is controversially poised to become her SME envoy next week -- was nowhere to be seen during the two-day Parliament session this week. But he was certainly the talk of the town. On Thursday, more than half of the Parliament's 705 lawmakers called on the Commission to rescind Pieper's appointment and reopen a \"truly transparent and open\" recruitment procedure.\n\nOut on a limb: EPP German Green lawmaker Daniel Freund, who is behind an amendment to a budget report that slams Pieper's nomination, said von der Leyen \"was apparently guided\" by party affiliation in choosing her CDU colleague for the plum gig. Only the EPP voted against Freund's non-binding amendment, while the ECR abstained, Giovanna Faggionato and Eddy Wax report.\n\nStill an MEP: Pieper has yet to comment publicly on the scandal. POLITICO knocked on the door of his parliamentary office Thursday to discover he wasn't there but that his team was still hard at work. Pieper takes up his new role at the Commission on April 16 but will remain an MEP until then. He didn't cast a vote during the March plenary week either, according to a review of the so-called roll-call votes.\n\nRebels with a cause: Two of Pieper's EPP colleagues voted against him on Freund's amendment. One, Latvia's Dace Melb\u0101rde, told Playbook \"the reports that the position was filled despite more qualified female candidates from underrepresented states prevailing in the recruitment assessments cannot be overlooked.\" The second EPP rebel was new MEP Ana Miguel dos Santos from Portugal.\n\nStand by your man: \"There is institutional autonomy in recruitment procedures. This is a strong principle that applies to all institutions,\" Commission spokesperson Eric Mamer told reporters, insisting Pieper is the best person for the job.\n\nTOP JOBS\n\nCOSTA 'STILL IN THE GAME': Portugal's ex-PM Ant\u00f3nio Costa is still in the running to step into Charles Michel's shoes as the next president of the European Council, according to two senior EU diplomats.\n\nRewind: Costa was widely considered a favorite for the job as he fulfilled two key conditions: being a Socialist and having served as a head of government. But after Costa resigned following an investigation into alleged corruption, critics argued that he shouldn't be considered until he is completely absolved.\n\nCosta forever: That concern now appears to be secondary for key EU governments, Barbara Moens writes in to report. \"Of course it's Costa,\" said one EU diplomat, referring to the most likely pick for Council presidency. \"The Germans back him, the French back him, everyone likes him. There is also no alternative. He's definitely still the frontrunner.\"\n\nProve it: Another senior diplomat insisted Costa was innocent until proven guilty, adding: \"The investigation is not an obstacle.\"\n\nNordic headwinds: But Costa may face opposition from Nordic countries which prioritize rule of law. Denmark also has another credible candidate for the job: Social Democrat Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. But in the fevered horse-trading that's likely to follow the June Parliament election, the Nordics could well be persuaded to back the Portuguese politician in exchange for some other key position.\n\nThere's another hurdle for Frederiksen: Denmark under her premiership has pursued some of the toughest immigration policies in Europe, which could make her unpopular with her Social-Democrat colleagues, Charlie Duxbury reports.\n\nNOW HEAR THIS: Our colleagues over at the EU Confidential podcast check in on the election campaign's state of play and conclude there's lots of animosity brewing. Host Sarah Wheaton and her guests (POLITICO's Elisa Braun, Eddy Wax, Clothilde Goujard and communications strategist Matteo Albania -- not to mention your Playbook author) hash out the many challenges facing von der Leyen.

The EU executive missed its deadline on average by around 40 days, Roos wrote.\n\nVon-delaying: The Commission took seven months to answer one of Roos' questions about its handling of Pfizergate and the ombudsman's finding of maladministration by the Commission, he pointed out in the letter.\n\nNOT IMMUNE: MEPs agreed to waive German lawmaker Gunnar Beck's immunity in a plenary vote Thursday. It came after a request by D\u00fcsseldorf's chief public prosecutor over an alleged shoplifting incident dating from 2022. Beck told my colleague Kathryn Carlson after the vote that the allegations are \"unfounded\" and \"it is clear\" they \"would have been made, were I not a member of the AfD.\"\n\nMEDIA CORNER\n\nHUNGARY'S SHADOW HANGS OVER EURONEWS: According to an investigation by France's Le Monde, Hungary's Direkt36 and Portugal's Expresso, around one third of the funding for Euronews' move to Brussels and relaunch comes from entities linked to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n.\n\nWhat are they trying to achieve? The investigation cites a \"strictly confidential\" document from the Hungarian fund behind the money which states that a key goal of financing Euronews is to \"attenuate the left-wing biases of journalism.\" Here's the piece in English.\n\nNothing to see here: Contacted by the outlets, the head of Euronews, Guillaume Dubois, said he \"sincerely did not know\" the provenance of funding for his channel's reboot, but that in any case it \"has no importance\" because Alpac -- a Portuguese investment fund -- retained sole control over the channel.\n\n** Meet our moderators for the Maastricht Debate: Barbara Moens - Chief EU Correspondent at POLITICO and Marcia Luyten - Dutch journalist, writer, presenter, publicist and alumna of Maastricht University.

        "text": "Kerala's ruling CPI(M) and opposition Congress have collapsed due to appeasement politics pursued by these parties to win over extremist elements in the state. Senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar alleged that the Congress-led UDF and the CPI(M)-headed LDF are fighting the polls solely on the agenda of extremist elements, focusing on issues like CAA and Palestine instead of prioritizing a development agenda. This has led to the other sections of society, considered the backbone of the Left party and the Congress, being \"very much angry\" with them.The traditional vote-bases of Kerala's ruling CPI(M) and opposition Congress have \"completely collapsed\" due to the \"worst kind of appeasement politics\" pursued by these parties to win over extremist elements in the state, claims senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar. In an interview to PTI, Javadekar, who is the BJP's Kerala in-charge, alleged that the Congress-led UDF and the CPI(M)-headed LDF were fighting the polls solely on the agenda of extremist elements, focusing on issues like CAA and Palestine instead of prioritising a development agenda.\n\nDue to this, the other sections of society, considered to be the backbone of the Left party and the Congress, are \"very much angry\" with them, he claimed.\n\n\"Kerala election has entered a very exciting phase of electioneering. I say this because many earlier equations are collapsing. Earlier, it was Muslims and Christians for the UDF while Ezhavas and other Hindus for the CPI(M). But it has completely collapsed,\" Javadekar claimed.\n\nHe said the BJP is fighting the polls solely on the development agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"The CPI(M)-led LDF and the Congress-led UDF-both are not talking about the development of India. They are focusing on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). They are discussing Palestine. Today, secularism is Sarv Dharma Sama Bhavana, respect for all religions. But instead, they are preaching...their agenda is completely focused on competitive appeasement of extremist elements,\" he alleged.\n\nJavadekar, who has been camping in Kerala for the last several months for building the party's campaign for the Lok Sabha polls, claimed the ban imposed on the Islamist outfit Popular Front of India (PFI) by the BJP-led NDA government was welcomed by an entire section of Kerala society.\n\nAnd the Christians are now upset with the Congress after the SDPI, the political arm of PFI, extended its support to the grand old party in the Lok Sabha polls, \"and they are now coming with Narendra Modi-ji,\" he said.\n\n\"The Ezhava community is very much angry with the CPI(M) because it has started the worst kind of appeasement of extremist elements like PFI. Their whole agenda is that extremist elements' agenda. What are they talking about? They are not talking about the development of Kerala,\" Javadekar alleged.\n\nThe former union minister further said the competitive appeasement of extremist elements practiced by the CPI(M) is a real trigger for Christians also to distance themselves from the ruling party.\n\nAnd the Ezhava community and other sections, who traditionally voted for the CPI(M), are now considering voting for BJP because Modi has helped them, Javadekar said.\n\nThe former Union Information and Broadcasting Minister criticised the stand taken by the CPI(M) and the Congress on telecasting the controversial movie \"The Kerala Story\" by various Christian groups in the state, alleging these parties were intervening in the personal freedom of the people and were again merely offering \"lip service\" to extremist elements.\n\nThe Sudipto Sen-directed \"The Kerala Story\", which hit theatres last year, tells the story of a group of women from Kerala who were forced to convert to Islam and join terror outfit ISIS.\n\nJavadekar further said all sections in Kerala, particularly the Christian community, are happy with the steps taken by the Modi government like banning PFI, working against terrorism, condemning the first attack by Hamas militants on Israeli citizens and condemning terror attack in Russia.\n\nThe former union minister also claimed that the Christian community is coming closer to the BJP and will vote for the party, as \"they know that Rahul Gandhi is not going to become the prime minister and the Congress has no future.\"\n\nAsked about the violence in Manipur and the Christian community's concern over it, Javadekar said it was not a Hindu-Christian fight but a conflict between Kukkis and Meitis-two tribal communities. He accused the Congress and the CPI(M) of \"unleashing a misinformation campaign\" about it in Kerala.\n\nListing the benefits extended to people by the BJP government, Javadekar said, \"Modiji doesn't discriminate,\" while the LDF and the UDF choose their loyalists, favourites, and cadres for extending benefits.\n\nHe said all sections of Kerala society, including Muslims and Christians, are happy with the Modi government because of the development works undertaken by it in the state, including the introduction of Vande Bharat trains and the rapid completion of National Highways.\n\nIn reaching out to the families of expatriates, he noted that Indians living abroad are very happy because India's stature has risen in geopolitics due to PM Modi's diplomacy. He also recalled the missions undertaken by the Modi government to rescue priests, nurses, and students stranded in conflict zones like Yemen, Iraq, and Ukraine.\n\n\"So, therefore, it is an exciting phase of the election. We are making a big impact, and people will truly understand on June 4 (the day the votes are counted),\" he said.",

        "text": "The decision to ramp up efforts to draw Indian tourists follows a significant backlash against the Maldives triggered by derogatory remarks made against India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media by three Maldivian officials. This backlash led to numerous cancellations of reservations and a drop in plans to visit the Maldives by Indian tourists, including several celebrities.\n\nIn an attempt to woo Indian tourists back to Maldives, a major tourism body in the island nation has revealed plans to conduct road shows across several key Indian cities. The move comes as the number of Indian visitors to the Maldives has seen a decline in recent times.\n\nThe Maldives Association of Travel Agents and Tour Operators (MATATO) disclosed its intention to hold discussions with India's high commissioner in the Maldives, Munu Mahawar, to explore ways to enhance travel and tourism cooperation between the two countries.\n\nThe decision to ramp up efforts to draw Indian tourists follows a significant backlash against the Maldives triggered by derogatory remarks made against India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media by three Maldivian officials. This backlash led to numerous cancellations of reservations and a drop in plans to visit the Maldives by Indian tourists, including several celebrities.\n\nAccording to statistics from the Maldives' ministry of tourism, India, which was previously one of the top visitor countries, has slipped to the sixth position in terms of tourist arrivals. China currently leads with the highest number of tourists, followed by the United Kingdom, Russia, Italy, and Germany.\n\nFollowing discussions held at the Indian high commission in Male, MATATO announced plans to collaborate closely with the Indian high commission to boost tourism initiatives. This includes launching comprehensive road shows across key Indian cities and organizing influencer and media familiarization trips to the Maldives in the coming months.\n\nMATATO emphasized the importance of India as a crucial tourist market for the Maldives and expressed its eagerness to partner with prominent travel associations and industry stakeholders in India to promote the Maldives as a premier travel destination.\n\nThis initiative comes amid tensions between the Maldives and India, with Maldives President Mohamed Muizzu previously requesting the withdrawal of Indian military personnel from the country, citing sovereignty concerns. Muizzu has announced plans to repatriate all Indian military personnel from the Maldives by May 10.",

        "title": "Israel's United Nations Ambassador gives talk on Israel-Hamas war",
        "text": "Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations Gilad Erdan spoke on Wednesday to a crowded auditorium at the Jewish Community Center - Chabad of Aspen about the current state of the war against Hamas and the falsehoods and misinformation he said he feels have been increasing since the Hamas attack on Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nIn addition to serving as Israel's UN Ambassador, he served as Israel's Ambassador to the United States, which made him the first person to hold both roles concurrently since Israeli diplomat and politician Abba Eban during the '50s.\n\nErdan also spent 17 years serving in the Israeli Knesset and held several ministerial positions including Minister of Public Security, Minister of Strategic Affairs, and Minister of Environmental Protection. He was a member of Israel's Security Cabinet while leading many reforms within Israeli's society.\n\nIn an introduction, Rabbi Mendel Mintz said Erdan has remained Israel's voice on a global scale since the Oct. 7 attacks and continues to lead a fight for Israel's future at the UN and elsewhere.\n\n\"His excellency speaks truth to power, combats the falsehoods, ensures that the release of the hostages is always at the forefront, and relentlessly defends Israel's legitimacy in the war against Hamas terror,\" Mintz said. \"As a steadfast defender of Israel in a place where anti-Israel bias is institutionalized, Ambassador Erdan is constantly fighting for Israel on the world stage and makes the truth heard loud and clear.\"\n\nErdan began his talk by reminding that, as of last Sunday, it has been six months since Hamas orchestrated the most brutal massacre of the Jewish people since the Holocaust. He spoke of parents and children being murdered in front of one another as well as Israeli women becoming victims of systemic systematic rape while over 250 of hostages were taken by Hamas to Gaza.\n\n\"From the ashes of this tragedy, we have also witnessed something beautiful,\" Erdan said. \"We have seen the Jewish people rise up together with pride, with strength. And over the past six months, Jews, the world over by the way, put differences aside and stood together as one people. We became one people with one heart.\"\n\nYet another reminder he shared with Wednesday night's crowd was Hamas' use of GoPro cameras to livestream their brutal attacks online. He stressed the importance of bearing in mind such a crucial detail when trying to analyze Hamas' \"vicious plan,\" which he said has gone far beyond the indiscriminate murdering of Israeli civilians and missile attacks on cities and villages they've endured for years.\n\nErdan further raised the question of how Hamas planned to survive retaliation when they knew all too well that Israel would quickly answer back with aggressive force. He said the answer to the question is found in Hamas' attempts to \"weaponize\" the UN in order to prevent Israel from exercising a right to self defense.\n\n\"Today, their strategy is different; they do not aim to attack our military, our soldiers. Their strategy is to target us where they think we are weak on our homefront,\" he said. \"But when we stand together as one people, having the backs of every Israeli, we send a clear message to our enemies,\" he said. \"You try to break us and divide us, but we will never be broken, we will never be broken.\"\n\nIn addition to speaking out against Hamas, Erdan also shared strong criticism for the UN, as well, at one point going so far as to refer to the international organization as collaborators with terrorists. He explained how the political makeup of the UN has changed dramatically over the years with the inclusion of member states. The UN, which was founded in 1945, began with 57 member states two years after the end of the Holocaust.\n\nToday, the UN is home to 193 countries, 56 of which are Muslim. According to Erdan, that's nearly 1/3 of the UN's total, with more than half of the UN's countries not being democracies. It's through these gradual changes that he pinpoints as the cause for the UN's perceived hostility towards Israel, pointing to 70% of the UN's condemnations going to Israel as evidence -- that's more than Russia, Syria, North Korea, and Iran combined.\n\n\"The UN has been dominated by terrorists and tyrants,\" he said. \"In the General Assembly, most of the countries are nondemocratic, but sometimes they love democratic values because in the 193 member states, every country has exactly the same voting power. So with Muslim countries and nondemocratic countries, the result is ... (t)he UN has become a weapon in the hands of our enemies.\"\n\nBefore concluding the evening's talk for audience questions, Erdan made the comparison to the US and allies taking nine months to reclaim Mosul from ISIS, which at the time was being held by 5,000 terrorists, whereas in less than six months, the IDF has neutralized over 20,000 Hamas terrorists. He said that a ceasefire would only allow for Hamas to stay in power, and that the only path forward was to continue fighting until all of Hamas has been dismantled.\n\n\"Policymakers must understand that Israel cannot stop fighting until commerce is obliterated and our hostages return. Did anyone call for a ceasefire when the Allies fought the Nazis? Did anyone call for a ceasefire when the world fought Al Qaeda or ISIS? No and no,\" he said. \"I know that Israel's future is bright; we just need to preserve our unity and perseverance, today more than ever. God willing we will obliterate Hamas, God willing we will bring the hostages home, and God willing we will prevail.\"",

The world needs the United States to continue playing this pivotal role in the affairs of nations,\" Kishida said.\n\n\"And yet, as we meet here today, I detect an undercurrent of self-doubt among some Americans about what your role in the world should be,\" he added.\n\nIt was the first speech by a foreign leader presided over by House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), who is overseeing a conference in chaos, with a small group of GOP lawmakers frequently blocking efforts to legislate based on their own criticisms, The Hill reported.\n\nKishida's government has drawn a direct line between supporting Ukraine in its defensive war against Russia as essential to deterring China from launching aggression against Taiwan and triggering a war in East Asia.\n\n\"As I often say, Ukraine of today may be East Asia of tomorrow,\" he said. At this line, while Harris and other members stood and applauded, Johnson remained seated.\n\nEarlier in his speech, Kishida highlighted that China's military actions present an unprecedented challenge to the peace and stability of the international community.\n\n\"China's current external stance and military actions present an unprecedented and the greatest strategic challenge, not only to the peace and security of Japan, but to the peace and stability of the international community at large.\"\n\nKishida's plea spoke to a rare agreement on both sides of the aisle in Congress recognising China as the priority threat to the present, US-led global order.\n\nThe Hill reported that Kishida's appeal was aimed directly at Republicans who view US engagement on the world stage as a trade-off to focusing on problems at home.

        "title": "As central banks wrestle with when to cut rates, ECB signals it's ready to move",
        "text": "AP President of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde.\n\nThe European Central Bank signalled on Thursday it could cut interest rates at its next meeting in June, a big step as the rich world's central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, wrestle with how soon declining inflation will let them lower credit costs for business and consumers.\n\nThe bank left its key rate benchmarks unchanged at a record high of 4.0 per cent, but ECB President Christine Lagarde said a rate cut was now on the table.\n\nIf incoming data confirm inflation's decline, \"it would be appropriate to reduce the current level of monetary policy restriction,\" she said at her post-decision news conference.\n\nThe policy meeting at the bank's skyscraper headquarters in Frankfurt was widely regarded as a prelude to the June 6 meeting, after Lagarde had dropped a broad hint by saying that the bank would have more information on the path of inflation at that meeting.\n\nThursday's stance \"officially opens the door to a June rate cut,\" said Carsten Brzeski, chief of global macro at ING bank. \"This is the first time the ECB has talked about rate cuts in its official policy announcement.\"\n\nThe decision comes as the rich world's central banks are tilting towards undoing some of the sharp hikes to interest rates that were imposed, with the goal of getting inflation under control. The Swiss National Bank was the first major central bank to cut rates in the current cycle on March 21. The big exception is Japan, which raised rates for the first time in 17 years on March 19.\n\nIt's a policy shift closely watched by stock investors. Markets soared in recent months on expectations of lower rates by this summer. Broad stock market indexes fell immediately in the United States on Wednesday and bond prices rose after a hotter than expected inflation reading of 3.5 per cent for March raised fears that the Fed may wait longer than previously thought to lower its benchmark interest rate.\n\nLagarde said the ECB's actions on rates were based on Europe's inflation data, and only took US inflation into account as part of the bigger global picture, including China, Japan and emerging markets. \"We have to determine monetary policy decisions on the basis of the data that are produced by the euro area, on the basis of the global environment,\" she said.\n\nThe drivers of inflation in the US are different, she said, and \"the two economies are not the same\".\n\nInflation in the 20 European Union member countries that use the euro currency, and where the ECB sets interest rate policy, has fallen to 2.4 per cent in March, down from a peak of 10.6 per cent in October 2023.\n\nEconomists say US inflation was driven by large-scale government spending, while Europe's price spike came from an outside shock: Russia cutting off most supplies of cheap natural gas after its invasion of Ukraine. Energy prices have now fallen to pre-war levels, and inflation levels have gradually eased as a result.\n\nHigher rates help squelch inflation by raising the cost of borrowing to buy things, which can cool demand for goods -- but they can also slow growth if overdone or maintained for too long. And growth in Europe has been anaemic, to say the least. The eurozone economy didn't grow at all in the last three months of last year, and the outlook for the figures from the quarter just ended isn't much better.\n\nThe central bank's benchmarks guide the costs of borrowing for banks, and, through that, influence rates throughout the economy, from business credit lines to mortgages and credit cards to government bonds.\n\nRate cuts can boost stocks because they suggest the central bank sees a strong economy ahead that will boost corporate profits, and because lower interest rates make stocks relatively more attractive, compared with interest-bearing holdings such as bonds or CDs.",

I say this because many earlier equations are collapsing. Earlier, it was Muslims and Christians for the UDF while Ezhavas and other Hindus for the CPI(M). But it has completely collapsed,\" Javadekar claimed.\n\nHe said the BJP is fighting the polls solely on the development agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"The CPI(M)-led LDF and the Congress-led UDF -- both are not talking about the development of India. They are focusing on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). They are discussing Palestine. Today, secularism is Sarv Dharma Sama Bhavana, respect for all religions. But instead, they are preaching...their agenda is completely focused on competitive appeasement of extremist elements,\" he alleged.\n\nJavadekar, who has been camping in Kerala for the last several months for building the party's campaign for the Lok Sabha polls, claimed the ban imposed on the Islamist outfit Popular Front of India (PFI) by the BJP-led NDA government was welcomed by an entire section of Kerala society.\n\nAnd the Christians are now upset with the Congress after the SDPI, the political arm of PFI, extended its support to the grand old party in the Lok Sabha polls, \"and they are now coming with Narendra Modi-ji,\" he said.\n\n\"The Ezhava community is very much angry with the CPI(M) because it has started the worst kind of appeasement of extremist elements like PFI. Their whole agenda is that extremist elements' agenda. What are they talking about? They are not talking about the development of Kerala,\" Javadekar alleged.\n\nThe former union minister further said the competitive appeasement of extremist elements practiced by the CPI(M) is a real trigger for Christians also to distance themselves from the ruling party.\n\nAnd the Ezhava community and other sections, who traditionally voted for the CPI(M), are now considering voting for BJP because Modi has helped them, Javadekar said.\n\nThe former Union Information and Broadcasting Minister criticised the stand taken by the CPI(M) and the Congress on telecasting the controversial movie \"The Kerala Story\" by various Christian groups in the state, alleging these parties were intervening in the personal freedom of the people and were again merely offering \"lip service\" to extremist elements.\n\nThe Sudipto Sen-directed \"The Kerala Story\", which hit theatres last year, tells the story of a group of women from Kerala who were forced to convert to Islam and join terror outfit ISIS.\n\nJavadekar further said all sections in Kerala, particularly the Christian community, are happy with the steps taken by the Modi government like banning PFI, working against terrorism, condemning the first attack by Hamas militants on Israeli citizens and condemning terror attack in Russia.\n\nThe former union minister also claimed that the Christian community is coming closer to the BJP and will vote for the party, as \"they know that Rahul Gandhi is not going to become the prime minister and the Congress has no future.\"\n\nAsked about the violence in Manipur and the Christian community's concern over it, Javadekar said it was not a Hindu-Christian fight but a conflict between Kukkis and Meitis -- two tribal communities. He accused the Congress and the CPI(M) of \"unleashing a misinformation campaign\" about it in Kerala.\n\nListing the benefits extended to people by the BJP government, Javadekar said, \"Modiji doesn't discriminate,\" while the LDF and the UDF choose their loyalists, favourites, and cadres for extending benefits.\n\nHe said all sections of Kerala society, including Muslims and Christians, are happy with the Modi government because of the development works undertaken by it in the state, including the introduction of Vande Bharat trains and the rapid completion of National Highways.\n\nIn reaching out to the families of expatriates, he noted that Indians living abroad are very happy because India's stature has risen in geopolitics due to PM Modi's diplomacy. He also recalled the missions undertaken by the Modi government to rescue priests, nurses, and students stranded in conflict zones like Yemen, Iraq, and Ukraine.\n\n\"So, therefore, it is an exciting phase of the election. We are making a big impact, and people will truly understand on June 4 (the day the votes are counted),\" he said.",

        "title": "NATO Preparing for Combat in Ukraine?",
        "text": "In the midst of the war in Ukraine, NATO in January launched its largest military exercise in 36 years, still underway and continuing through May 31, a 5-month series of major maneuvers staged largely in new NATO member states, bordering the Russian Federation. Can you say: 'world war powder-keg'?\n\nCode-named 'Steadfast Defender,' the rehearsal involves 90,000 troops from thirty-one NATO states, employing battle ships, jet fighters, drones, tanks, and other vehicles.\n\nIn late February operation 'Nordic Response' paraded 20,000 soldiers, 50 warships and 100 warplanes from 13 NATO states across land and sea between Scotland, Norway, and Iceland. NATO said the maneuver was integrated with the naval exercise 'Joint Warrior.' At the same time, soldiers enacted 'Brilliant Jump' in Drawsko Pomorskie, Poland.\n\nIn early March, heavy armor from nine NATO states conducted operation 'Dragon,' an amphibious, bridge-building crossing the Vistula, the largest river in Poland.\n\nWhile NATO claimed Nordic Response was not linked to Russia's incursion into Ukraine, the Polish military frankly declared that Dragon, 'demonstrates the ability to counter ... the Russian Federation.'\n\nWith the war against Russia being funded, armed, and directed by the U.S. and NATO, the war games were announced by NATO's top commander, U.S. Army General Chris Cavoli, who said it will showcase NATO's 'determination to protect ... the rules-based international order.'\n\nComing from the United States, the phrase 'rules-based international order' is the laugh-line of the century. Even a partial list of its violations since 1999 alone is demonstrative: the '99 U.S.-led war on Yugoslavia; the '01 U.S. invasion and occupation of Afghanistan; the '03 U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq; eight years of torturing kidnapped suspects by the Bush/Cheney administration; indefinite, incommunicado detention without charges of suspects at Guantanamo Bay for 23 years; ongoing missile and drone killings in Syria, Somalia, and Yemen; the '20 assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad. All these military actions are flagrant, criminal abuse of binding international rules-based order including the UN Charter and the Geneva Conventions. The Bush/Cheney torturers even defied the U.S.'s own Torture Statue, which, upon a conviction, carries the death penalty. President Obama's decision not to prosecute the architects of the torture regime constitutes criminal negligence itself, and a precedent-setting exoneration of home-grown barbarism. Pax Americans is no rules-based order, but de-based and dis-ordered crime spree of endless, undeclared, unconstitutional war-making -- a war crime spree if you will.\n\nBut don't say this crime doesn't pay. Today, the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, or Ramstein Group, is the cabal of 56 militaries (NATO states and 24 others) now profiteering from the war against Russia. According to the Major Arms Sales Notification Tracker from the Forum on the Arms Trade, $46 billion in weapons has been delivered to Ukraine in the first quarter of 2024; $106 billion in 2023; $81 billion in 2022; $36 billion in 2021 -- before the Russian invasion; and in 2020 -- also well before the invasion -- an astronomical $134 billion.\n\nAfter such a huge investment in the NATO campaign against Russia, today's very real prospect of Ukraine losing the war has moved France's President Macron to tell the press, 'Maybe at some point... we will have to have operations on the ground ... to counter the Russian forces.' Speaking to the French daily Le Parisien, Macron said, 'France's strength is that we can do it.'\n\nMacron told the paper, 'On March 26, representatives of about 20 Western states discussed ... an option to send ground troops to Ukraine.' Macron admitted that the allies did not reach agreement sending in NATO troops (and provoking world war 3), but he did warn, 'such a scenario could not be ruled out.' After meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Macron preposterously claimed that the war in Ukraine was an 'existential' threat to France and Europe. Mr. Scholz rejected Macron's jingoism, saying 'We've agreed on no ground troops.' Yet even Scholz's push-back was alarmingly weak, as it left open the possible use of NATO fighter jets, heavy bombers, and war ships.\n\nThen, poking back at Chancellor Scholz, France's top general Thierry Burkhard doubled-down on Macron's incendiary talk, saying on March 22 that Russia should not expect NATO to limit its support of Ukraine to merely supplying arms.\n\nIf ever there was a time for anti-war activism it's now, before NATO's world war engulfs everything.",

        "title": "Germany's Big Lie About Alternative Energy Can't Be Denied Any More",
        "text": "After a combination of natural disasters forced the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in Japan, taxpayer-funded activists in Germany seized on the hysteria to demand that their country switch to solar and wind energy. The technology was ready, they insisted, all that was needed was \"political will\" and the government needed to \"show leadership\" - and so the people believed.\n\nIndependent science media like us reported on reality. Europe's climate agreement had declared CO2 emissions would be charged to the exporting nation so they burned imported wood, and German companies made a fortune selling natural gas-derived energy on the spot market. Which they bought from Russia, via Ukraine pipes.\n\nThe first time Russia attacked Ukraine, Germany even scrambled to bypass Ukraine, by violating their own environmental laws and fast-tracking a pipeline that came directly from Russia. Russia knew that was the time to strike. Without the 55% of their energy from Russia, Germans would be paralyzed. So they invaded Ukraine again.\n\nWhat $4 trillion in alternative energy subsidies gets you. Very little. For that money, all of Europe and the US could have emissions-free nuclear. Instead, the world let the energy equivalent of thoughts and prayers by activists do to energy what belief in magic did to Sri Lanka with 'organic' food.\n\nThis was impossible for Europe to completely ignore, but they were stuck looking for new sources. They knew solar and wind were making little difference. Suddenly their citizens did too. Two years in, one of Germany's renewable power leaders has admitted that without nuclear and coal they've become so reliant on imported natural gas they may never recover. Manufacturing will continue to shut down.\n\nSmart German companies have instead invested in the US, tripling in 2023. You know when Bidenomics in America look good, Europe is really bad.\n\nThey shouldn't invest in California, though. The state has encouraged environmentalists to block maintenance of the state's only remaining nuclear plant, even as poor people are saddled with the nation's highest energy costs due to enacting the same reactionary policies as Germany. California is stuck importing energy with no relief in sight.",

        "title": "Sanctions Update: OFAC Re-Emphasizes Applicability Of Sanctions To Non-US Persons - Export Controls & Trade & Investment Sanctions - United States",
        "text": "To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com.\n\nOn March 6, 2024, the US Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (\"OFAC\"), the US Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") and the US Department of Commerce (collectively, the \"Agencies\") published their latest in a series of Tri-Seal Compliance Notes in which they emphasized that foreign-based persons have an obligation to comply with US sanctions and export controls. The Compliance Note does not reflect any policy change, but serves as a reminder that the Agencies have enforced sanctions and export controls against non-US persons, and highlights that non-US firms should implement measures to mitigate their risk of violating US laws. The Compliance Note also comes just a few months after the issuance of Executive Order (\"E.O.\") 14114, which authorizes OFAC to sanction foreign financial institutions that engage in significant transactions with Russia's military-industrial sector. Below, we focus on the Compliance Note's description of transactions in which OFAC has asserted authority to bring enforcement actions against non-US persons for sanctions violations and summarize some key implications for non-US fund managers.\n\nOFAC administers a variety of economic and trade sanctions measures that target foreign governments, private entities and individuals engaged in conduct that is adverse to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States. OFAC sanctions may require US persons to \"block\" or freeze the property of designated persons, or refrain from transactions involving certain countries or territories or specific activities, such as dealing in the equity securities of a sanctioned target or providing designated services to persons located in certain jurisdictions. Importantly, OFAC sanctions are based on strict liability, and OFAC may impose a civil penalty for even an unknowing or inadvertent violation.\n\nTypically, the obligations arising from OFAC sanctions apply to US persons. However, the Compliance Note explains that OFAC's enforcement authority extends to any non-US person that causes or conspires to cause a US person to \"wittingly or unwittingly violate US sanctions,\" or engages in evading US sanctions.\n\nThe Compliance Note summarizes the types of violative conduct which will cause OFAC to actively employ its enforcement authority as follows: the obscuring or omitting of a reference to the involvement of a sanctioned party or jurisdiction in a financial transaction involving a US person; misleading US persons into exporting goods to a sanctioned jurisdiction; and routing a prohibited transaction through the United States or the US financial system. To highlight the types of conduct that OFAC may seek to penalize, the Compliance Note describes three recent enforcement actions:\n\nSeparately, on March 14, 2024, shortly after publishing the Compliance Note, OFAC announced another enforcement action against EFG International AG (\"EFG\"), a non-US private banking group based in Switzerland with numerous subsidiaries located throughout the world (including Miami, FL). EFG settled with OFAC for $3.7 million for apparent violations of multiple OFAC sanctions programs. EFG's subsidiaries processed numerous securities-related transactions and funds transfers through omnibus accounts at US custodians or involving US persons, where those omnibus accounts held sub-accounts for persons located in Cuba or that were beneficially owned by Cuban nationals, or were designated under the Narcotics Trafficking Kingpin or the Russian Harmful Foreign Activities sanctions programs. EFG knew or had reason to know that the sub-account holders were sanctioned under US law, and caused US persons, including its own Miami-based subsidiary, to violate OFAC sanctions by processing the violative transactions without disclosing to their US custodians and other US securities firms that some of the omnibus accounts' underlying beneficiaries were sanctioned. In some instances, EFG had implemented internal restrictions meant to comply with US sanctions, but failed to notify its US custodians and securities firms about the sanctioned beneficiaries. This recent action against EFG serves as a reminder of the risks inherent in transacting with omnibus accounts where the underlying sub-account holders are undisclosed.\n\nThe above violations of OFAC sanctions resulted in civil monetary penalties. However, where the conduct constitutes a \"willful\" violation of US sanctions, the DOJ may bring criminal charges. The Compliance Note explains that the conduct prohibited under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (\"IEEPA\"), which authorizes imposition of sanctions, includes \"caus[ing] a violation of any license, order, regulation, or prohibition issued\" pursuant to IEEPA, and that willful violations are punishable by imprisonment of up to 20 years and a $1 million fine. As an example of a recent criminal action for sanctions violations, among other charges, the Compliance Note references a criminal action brought by the DOJ in which Binance Holdings Limited (\"Binance\"), a non-US entity registered in the Cayman Islands that operated a large international cryptocurrency exchange, pled guilty to, among other charges, violations of IEEPA. Binance admitted that it had numerous users located in comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions, including Iran, and that its cryptocurrency exchange system would cause US users to transact with the users in sanctioned jurisdictions and that it failed to implement controls to prevent such transactions. Binance incurred financial penalties of $4.3 billion for these and other Bank Secrecy Act violations, of which the DOJ credited nearly one billion dollars towards Binance's settlement with OFAC for violating multiple sanctions programs.\n\nForeign nationals may also be subject to criminal prosecution for aiding sanctioned persons in the evasion of US sanctions. In 2022, the DOJ charged a U.K. national, Graham Bonham-Carter, with violations of IEEPA and wire fraud in connection with transactions he conducted in the United States on behalf of an individual who was sanctioned by OFAC. The DOJ alleges that Bonham-Carter was employed by Oleg Deripaska and continued to work for him even after Deripaska was sanctioned by OFAC. Bonham-Carter arranged to make payments for the upkeep of Deripaska's real estate holdings in the United States and attempted to ship artwork owned by Deripaska from a New York auction house to the UK by misrepresenting the identity of the artwork's owner. According to the indictment, Bonham-Carter violated Section 1705 of IEEPA, in that his conduct constituted the \"[provision of] funds, goods, and services to and for the benefit\" of a sanctioned person, as well as the evasion and avoidance of \"the requirements of United States law with respect to [OFAC sanctions].\" Bonham-Carter was arrested in the U.K. but has not been extradited as of the date of this publication.\n\nIn addition to OFAC's and DOJ's inherent authority to take enforcement action against non-US persons, the Russian sanctions program was also recently expanded to enable OFAC to sanction foreign financial institutions (\"FFIs\") that engage in certain transactions with companies in the Russian military-industrial base. E.O. 14114, issued on Dec. 22, 2023, authorizes OFAC to impose \"secondary sanctions\" on FFIs that facilitate significant transactions on behalf of designated persons operating in key sectors of the Russian economy that support Russia's military capability, or that facilitate significant transactions or provide services involving Russia's military-industrial base. Foreign financial institutions that engage in such transactions may either be prohibited from opening or subject to strict conditions in maintaining correspondent accounts or payable-through accounts in the United States or may be subject to full blocking sanctions. For FFIs that OFAC blocks, \"all property and interests in property of those FFIs that are in the United States or in the possession or control of US persons are blocked and must be reported to OFAC.\"\n\nThe Compliance Note provides several key compliance considerations for foreign-based persons, including employing a risk-based sanctions compliance program; establishing strong internal controls for payments involving affiliates, subsidiaries, agents or counterparties to detect \"linkages to sanctioned persons or jurisdictions that may otherwise be obscured\"; integrating know-your-customer information into sanctions screening protocols; ensuring personnel, subsidiaries and affiliates are trained on US sanctions requirements and can effectively identify red flags and will escalate any potential sanctions violations to management; and taking immediate and effective action when sanctions issues are identified and amending compliance policies to address weaknesses.\n\nConsistent with OFAC's recommendations, and in light of recent enforcement actions, a robust compliance program should include screening all investors against OFAC's sanctions lists prior to onboarding and periodically thereafter, implementing controls to ensure the manager has up-to-date information on the sanctions status of any beneficiaries to omnibus accounts invested in their funds, and taking appropriate measures to ensure no transactions of the fund that are processed through the US financial institution will benefit, directly or indirectly, a sanctioned person.\n\nOFAC has made clear that non-US persons cannot assume that US sanctions do not apply to them. Non-US fund managers must be aware that if they interact with the US financial system or take on US investors, they could be subject to an OFAC enforcement action if they cause a US person to violate OFAC sanctions, even inadvertently. Moreover, under the Russian sanctions program, non-US persons that transact with Russian companies operating defense-related industries could be subject to OFAC sanctions themselves. Accordingly, non-US fund managers should implement policies and procedures that are designed to ensure compliance with the Executive Orders, statutes, programs and regulations administered by OFAC, as well as those sanctions programs administered by the authorities of the jurisdictions in which they are located or registered.\n\nWhen undertaking any proposed activity or transaction, fund managers should consider the following:\n\nFootnotes\n\nThe content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

        "title": "Case Summary: Commercial Court Refuses To Enforce Russian Jurisdiction Clauses In US$ 10 Billion Insurance Claims For Aircraft Stranded In Russia - Reinsurance - United States",
        "text": "To print this article, all you need is to be registered or login on Mondaq.com.\n\nIn an extensive Judgment of over 200 pages, Mr Justice Henshaw rejected jurisdiction challenges brought by the Defendant international reinsurers on the basis of Russian exclusive jurisdiction clauses (EJCs). Finding that the mostly western owners and lessors of over 200 aircraft were very unlikely to receive a fair trial in Russia, he refused to order a stay of the English proceedings.\n\nThe case is one of The Lawyer's Top 20 Cases of 2024. In total over 40 counsel were instructed for the jurisdiction hearing by 14 firms of solicitors, including no fewer than 10 Quadrant counsel, set out below.\n\nA. Background\n\nThe Claimants in the English proceedings are owners, lessors, financing banks (or their assignees) or managers of certain aircraft and/or aircraft engines which were leased to Russian airlines under leases governed by English, Californian or New York law.\n\nThe lessee airlines were required under the leases to insure the aircraft against all risks and war risks, and to obtain reinsurance on the international market containing a cut through clause permitting (according to the Claimants at least) the Claimants to sue the reinsurers directly in the event of insurance claims arising.\n\nFollowing the invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022, and as a direct or indirect result of the sanctions imposed by the EU, the US and the UK on Russia, the Claimants cancelled the leases and demanded the return of their aircraft. The Russian airlines failed to return those aircraft, and they remain in Russia to this day.\n\nThe Claimants sued the Defendant reinsurers under the cut-through clauses. Almost all of the served Defendant reinsurers initially challenged the jurisdiction of the English Court on the basis of EJCs requiring all disputes to be submitted to the Russian Courts. Prior to the jurisdiction hearing, a significant number of those reinsurers withdrew their challenges.\n\nThe Claimants opposed the jurisdiction challenges, primarily on the basis that they would not obtain justice in Russia. They also argued that to require them to pursue their claims in Russia would be contrary to English public policy because it would undermine the western sanctions imposed on Russia and give effect to Russia's countermeasures relating to the aircraft and their leasing. The Claimants also submitted that, in exercising its discretion, the Court should give considerable weight to the fact that allowing the challenges would result in an undesirable multiplicity of proceedings and a risk of inconsistent judgments given that a large number of similar claims would be proceeding before the English Court in any event.\n\nB. The Judgment\n\nHenshaw J heard all of the jurisdiction challenges relating to Russian EJCs in parallel over four days in February 2024, and handed down judgment on 28 March 2024.\n\n(1) Rulings as to the applicable legal tests\n\nStrong reasons required to decline to stay proceedings\n\nHenshaw J held that where a claim is brought in England in contravention of an EJC in favour of a foreign court, the presumption is that the English Court will grant a stay of the English proceedings, unless the party wishing to avoid the effect of the EJC can point to strong reasons for the Court not to do so.\n\nHaving considered a large number of relevant authorities, the Judge rejecteddictasuggesting that the party wishing to avoid an EJC might have to meet a higher threshold of establishing \"overwhelming\" or \"very strong\" reasons.\n\nThe relevance of foreseeability\n\nHenshaw J ruled that the authorities generally distinguished between factors of convenience and considerations of justice when discussing foreseeability, and that in principle an unfair trial is qualitatively different from both disadvantages of convenience (such as the location of witnesses) and from other matters such as the availability of appeals or disclosure. As, such there was no\"hard-edged\"test based on the foreseeability of an unfair trial.\n\nInstead, the Judge held that, whilst the Court was entitled to bear in mind the extent to which a risk of an unfair trial was foreseeable as a factor in exercising its discretion, such foreseeability would likely carry weight only to the extent that the parties could foresee a risk of an unfair trial in respect of the kind of dispute likely to arise under their contract. Mere foreseeability of injustice in the abstract was likely to be of little relevance.\n\nThe requisite likelihood of an unfair trial\n\nThere was considerable dispute between the parties as to whether a claimant had to show that it would not receive a fair trial on the balance of probabilities, or instead only need show a real risk of not receiving a fair trial.\n\nHenshaw J held that:\n\n(2) Application to the Facts - Justice in Russia\n\nApplying the legal principles set out above to the relevant facts and expert evidence, the Court found that the Claimants were very unlikely to receive a fair trial in Russia. In broad summary, this was due to the following factors:\n\nHenshaw J ruled that the potency of these factors was not undermined to any significant degree by the Defendants' arguments based on foreseeability.\n\n(3) Other Factors\n\nHenshaw J found that exercising the Court's discretion to refuse to stay proceedings was further supported by (i) avoiding fragmentation and multiplicity of proceedings - in light of the fact that proceedings considering the same key issues would be proceeding in England in any event, and (ii) the extent that experts and client representatives would be unable to attend trials in Russia due to a risk of targeted attacks.\n\nOn the other hand, the Court did not rely on public policy in declining to stay proceedings. The Judge's view was that to refuse a stay on the basis of public policy would require positive findings about the particular way in which a Russian Court would determine the claims if brought in Russia. He was hesitant about making such findings and therefore refused to determine the applications on that basis.\n\n10 Quadrant counsel were instructed for the jurisdiction hearing, as follows:\n\nChirag Karia KC, Peter Stevenson and Benjamin Joseph (instructed by Peter Sharp, David Waldron and Paul Mesquitta at Morgan Lewis & Bockius LLP) represented the GTLK MLB Claimants, one of the largest groups of claimants bringing claims worth USD 2.45 billion. The jurisdiction challenges in the GTLK Claims raise additional issues specific to those claims which are currently proceeding to a final jurisdiction hearing in July 2024.\n\nRobert-Jan Temmink KC and Tom Nixon (instructed by Peter Sharp, David Waldron and Paul Mesquitta at Morgan Lewis & Bockius LLP) represented the Merx MLB Claimants.\n\nMatthew Reeve KC and Joseph England (instructed by Simon Hens at McGuire Woods LLP) represented a claimant leasing company, Genesis GASL Ireland Leasing A-1 Limited.\n\nGuy Blackwood KC, Tom Bird and Robert Ward (instructed by Andrew Krausz, Sonia Lopez and Adam Baker at Weightmans LLP) represented certain Hull All Risks Defendant Reinsurers.",

        "title": "Food Security and Food Safety in Africa Must Go Hand in Hand",
        "text": "Monica Musonda, CEO, Java Foods, and Board Member, Partners in Food Solutions (PFS)\n\nLUSAKA, Zambia, Apr 12 2024 (IPS) - Russia's invasion of Ukraine has restricted international exports and sent food costs soaring - particularly for vulnerable populations still experiencing shocks from the pandemic and who can least afford to pay more to feed their families. Two years on, global food supply chains are still just as susceptible to serious disruptions caused by war, disease, and climate change. Those inevitable disruptions are leaving those on the African continent particularly vulnerable.\n\nEnsuring people have access to safe and nutritious food at an affordable price helps prevent malnutrition, boosts human capital, and improves health outcomes by decreasing susceptibility to a wide range of diseases. But none of this is possible if the local food supply is not safe for people to eat. Food security and food safety must go hand in hand, yet across Africa this remains a challenge. The continent has some of the highest rates of foodborne illness in the world. Globally, nearly half a million people die each year because of something they ate.\n\nFood scares are not only harmful for anyone who eats contaminated food, but also erodes trust of consumers in the products they buy for their families. To ensure a secure food supply, locally produced food must not only be readily available but also be safe for consumers to eat, meeting the same high-quality standards seen in imports.\n\nBut small and medium-sized companies in Africa struggle to meet international food safety standards, which often go above what is required on a national level. The process can be complicated, expensive, and time consuming, yet I believe it is vital for African food companies to seek these certifications to build consumer confidence and strengthen continental food security.\n\nI started Java Foods, a food company based in Lusaka, Zambia, out of the recognition that Africa imports large quantities of food, despite the fact that the continent is able to grow a diversity of crops. Our company focuses on using locally grown raw materials in our products, which we've designed specifically for the changing tastes of the youthful Zambian population.\n\nOne of our most successful products are packaged instant noodles, under the brand name eeZee, which are made with locally grown wheat fortified with 17 micronutrients, including iron and zinc. Although we produce processed foods, we want to ensure the highest nutritional value possible for our consumers who seek accessible and affordable food options.\n\nMaintaining high-quality food safety standards is the right thing to do for the consumer, and it has been the right thing to do for Java Foods - even if it has required significant investments in our facility and in our people.\n\nFood safety certification has to be paid for. The different sets of standards are run by private companies, which require food producers to buy the certification they want to implement and renew the certification every couple of years. Audits to ensure compliance are also costly.\n\nWith technical assistance from Partners in Food Solutions, a nonprofit which links African food producers with corporate volunteers from U.S.-based food companies, Java Foods was able to receive support in redesigning our plant to ensure we'll be compliant with international food safety standards. Our employees benefited from skills transfer using online conferencing tools that dramatically increased their professional skills and contributions to our team.\n\nIn addition to making changes to our factory floor plan, we also began a meticulous documentation process to create the records necessary to demonstrate that we were following the same standards to a T on every single batch of instant noodles. Our staff are central to getting this right, so Java Foods has created a culture where our employees understand why we take these extra steps, and take pride in ensuring our compliance.\n\nIt is possible for other companies to follow in Java's footsteps. There are several ways we can improve the food safety certification system to mutually benefit consumers, food processors, and regulating authorities.\n\nIn addition to better awareness of the existence of food safety standards and why companies should seek such certification to benefit their consumers, there needs to be more coordination on a regional and global level. Java Foods exports our products to neighboring countries, but each can require different steps to comply with their local regulations. Exporting our noodles to Zimbabwe, for example, requires us to complete an extra step not required elsewhere.\n\nThis means we shoulder extra expenses to expand our market, which cannot be passed along to the consumer because we make a low-cost product. Differing food safety standards become a trade barrier not only restricting the growth of businesses in Africa, but restricting food security as strengthening regional supply chains remains hampered by cumbersome regulations.\n\nLocal governments need more support to strengthen their food safety quality control capacity. This includes the facilities they provide for testing for food contaminants such as aflatoxins, from a mold that can develop on some crops when they aren't stored properly.\n\nWe also need better information sharing and data availability. Having information readily available online when our staff encounter an issue would save time and resources.\n\nAlthough it was laborious, Java Foods has immensely benefited from the decision to seek international food safety certification. The standards allow us to expand the market for our products, and we must ensure other companies can easily join us to strengthen Africa's food security.",

        "text": "Thiruvananthapuram, Apr 12 (PTI) The traditional vote-bases of Kerala's ruling CPI(M) and opposition Congress have \"completely collapsed\" due to the \"worst kind of appeasement politics\" pursued by these parties to win over extremist elements in the state, claims senior BJP leader Prakash Javadekar.\n\nIn an interview to PTI, Javadekar, who is the BJP's Kerala in-charge, alleged that the Congress-led UDF and the CPI(M)-headed LDF were fighting the polls solely on the agenda of extremist elements, focusing on issues like CAA and Palestine instead of prioritising a development agenda.\n\nDue to this, the other sections of society, considered to be the backbone of the Left party and the Congress, are \"very much angry\" with them, he claimed.\n\n\"Kerala election has entered a very exciting phase of electioneering. I say this because many earlier equations are collapsing. Earlier, it was Muslims and Christians for the UDF while Ezhavas and other Hindus for the CPI(M). But it has completely collapsed,\" Javadekar claimed.\n\nHe said the BJP is fighting the polls solely on the development agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\n\"The CPI(M)-led LDF and the Congress-led UDF -- both are not talking about the development of India. They are focusing on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). They are discussing Palestine. Today, secularism is Sarv Dharma Sama Bhavana, respect for all religions. But instead, they are preaching...their agenda is completely focused on competitive appeasement of extremist elements,\" he alleged.\n\nJavadekar, who has been camping in Kerala for the last several months for building the party's campaign for the Lok Sabha polls, claimed the ban imposed on the Islamist outfit Popular Front of India (PFI) by the BJP-led NDA government was welcomed by an entire section of Kerala society.\n\nAnd the Christians are now upset with the Congress after the SDPI, the political arm of PFI, extended its support to the grand old party in the Lok Sabha polls, \"and they are now coming with Narendra Modi-ji,\" he said.\n\n\"The Ezhava community is very much angry with the CPI(M) because it has started the worst kind of appeasement of extremist elements like PFI. Their whole agenda is that extremist elements' agenda. What are they talking about? They are not talking about the development of Kerala,\" Javadekar alleged.\n\nThe former union minister further said the competitive appeasement of extremist elements practiced by the CPI(M) is a real trigger for Christians also to distance themselves from the ruling party.\n\nAnd the Ezhava community and other sections, who traditionally voted for the CPI(M), are now considering voting for BJP because Modi has helped them, Javadekar said.\n\nThe former Union Information and Broadcasting Minister criticised the stand taken by the CPI(M) and the Congress on telecasting the controversial movie \"The Kerala Story\" by various Christian groups in the state, alleging these parties were intervening in the personal freedom of the people and were again merely offering \"lip service\" to extremist elements.\n\nThe Sudipto Sen-directed \"The Kerala Story\", which hit theatres last year, tells the story of a group of women from Kerala who were forced to convert to Islam and join terror outfit ISIS.\n\nJavadekar further said all sections in Kerala, particularly the Christian community, are happy with the steps taken by the Modi government like banning PFI, working against terrorism, condemning the first attack by Hamas militants on Israeli citizens and condemning terror attack in Russia.\n\nThe former union minister also claimed that the Christian community is coming closer to the BJP and will vote for the party, as \"they know that Rahul Gandhi is not going to become the prime minister and the Congress has no future.\" Asked about the violence in Manipur and the Christian community's concern over it, Javadekar said it was not a Hindu-Christian fight but a conflict between Kukkis and Meitis -- two tribal communities. He accused the Congress and the CPI(M) of \"unleashing a misinformation campaign\" about it in Kerala.\n\nListing the benefits extended to people by the BJP government, Javadekar said, \"Modiji doesn't discriminate,\" while the LDF and the UDF choose their loyalists, favourites, and cadres for extending benefits.\n\nHe said all sections of Kerala society, including Muslims and Christians, are happy with the Modi government because of the development works undertaken by it in the state, including the introduction of Vande Bharat trains and the rapid completion of National Highways.\n\nIn reaching out to the families of expatriates, he noted that Indians living abroad are very happy because India's stature has risen in geopolitics due to PM Modi's diplomacy. He also recalled the missions undertaken by the Modi government to rescue priests, nurses, and students stranded in conflict zones like Yemen, Iraq, and Ukraine.\n\n\"So, therefore, it is an exciting phase of the election. We are making a big impact, and people will truly understand on June 4 (the day the votes are counted),\" he said. PTI TGB TGB KH",

        "text": "Jason Allen / AP\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks Wednesday, April 10, 2024, after arriving in Atlanta.\n\nBy Lisa Mascaro and Jill Colvin, Associated Press\n\nThursday, April 11, 2024 | 10:07 p.m.\n\nPALM BEACH, Fla. -- House Speaker Mike Johnson is making a campaign pilgrimage to visit Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, a rite of passage as the embattled Republican leader positions himself, and his GOP majority, side-by-side with the indicted ex-president.\n\nThe two are planning a joint announcement on election integrity ahead of November, but the trip itself is significant for both. Johnson needs Trump to temper hard-line Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's threats to evict him from office. And Trump benefits from the imprimatur of official Washington dashing to Florida to embrace his comeback bid for the White House and his tangled election lies.\n\n\"It is the symbolism,\" said Charlie Sykes, a conservative commentator and frequent Trump critic.\n\n\"There was a time when the Speaker of the House of Representatives was a dominant figure in American politics,\" he said. \"Look where we are now, where he comes hat in hand to Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nHaving the House speaker and the presidential contender align for the campaign season is not in itself surprising or even unexpected, a typical arrangement as the party builds a coordinated effort of resources and proposals to present to voters in the fall.\n\nBut in the Trump era, the sojourns by Republican leaders to his private club in Palm Beach, Florida, have become defining moments, underscoring the lopsided partnership as the former president commandeers the party in sometimes humiliating displays of power.\n\nSuch was the case when Kevin McCarthy, then the House GOP leader, trekked to Mar-a-Lago after having been critical of the defeated president after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. A cheery photo was posted afterward, a sign of their mending relationship.\n\nJohnson proposed the idea of coming to Mar-a-Lago weeks before Greene filed her motion to vacate him from the speaker's office. The visit comes just days before the former president's criminal trial on hush money charges gets underway next week in New York City.\n\nThe trip shows the fragility of the speaker's grip on the gavel, just six months on the job since replacing the ousted McCarthy, but also his evolving grasp of the politics of the Trump era.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana understands he needs Trump's backing to conduct almost any business in the House -- including his next big priority, providing U.S. aid to Ukraine to fight Russia's invasion.\n\nThe speaker's own political livelihood depends on support -- or at least not opposition -- from the \"Make America Great Again\" Republicans who are aligned with Trump but creating much of the House dysfunction that has ground work to a halt.\n\nJohnson commands the narrowest majority in modern times and a single quip from the former president can derail legislation. He was once a Trump skeptic, but the two men now talk frequently, including earlier this week.\n\nEven still, Trump urged Republicans to \"kill\" a national security surveillance bill that Johnson had personally worked to pass, contributing to a sudden defeat that sent the House spiraling this week into crisis. It was expected to try again to pass the bill Friday before Johnson departs for Florida.\n\nIn a daring move, the speaker is working both sides to help Ukraine, talking directly to the White House on the national security package that is at risk of collapse with Trump's opposition. Greene is warning of a snap vote to oust Johnson from leadership if he allows any U.S. assistance to flow to the overseas ally.\n\n\"The funding of Ukraine must end,\" Greene said she told Johnson in a private meeting this week.\n\nOn the issue of election integrity, though, Johnson, who led one of the main legal challenges to the 2020 election won by Joe Biden, appears to be more aligned with Trump.\n\nTrump continues to insist the 2020 election was marred by fraud, even though no evidence has emerged in the last four years to support his claims and every state in the nation certified their results as valid.\n\nAs he runs to reclaim the White House, Trump has essentially taken over the Republican National Committee, turning the campaign apparatus toward his priorities. He supported Michael Whatley to lead the RNC, which created a new \"Election Integrity Division\" and says it is working to hire thousands of lawyers across the country.\n\nAt Friday's event they are expected to promote ideas to prevent noncitizens from voting, even though it's already a federal felony for a noncitizen to cast a ballot in a federal election. There's no evidence of significant numbers of immigrants violating that law by casting illegal ballots.\n\nSome liberal cities like San Francisco have begun to allow noncitizens to vote in a few local elections, leading Republicans to argue there need to be even more laws forbidding it in federal elections.\n\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said he was supportive of those proposals. \"How do you ensure that noncitizens are not voting? That's that's what this is all about.\"\n\nWith his majority shrinking due to early retirements and departures, Johnson is operating as a speaker in name only. But the more he depends on Democrats to provide the votes needed to pass substantial legislation, including last month's bills to keep the government from shutting down, the deeper trouble he courts from the MAGA Republicans.\n\nTrump could help Johnson by promoting the House's legislative priorities or, at least, not torpedoing them. But that seems increasingly uncertain as the presumed presidential nominee leads the GOP in a different direction on both domestic and foreign policy priorities.\n\nTired of the infighting and wary of another dragged-out brawl like the monthlong slugfest to replace McCarthy, few Republicans are backing Greene's effort to remove Johnson, for now.\n\n\"Marjorie's actions are horrific,\" said Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, a former Trump administration official. \"They are childish. They are petulant. They have no place here in this body.\"\n\nBut if Trump signals otherwise, that could all change.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker emeritus, said this week on \"The Axe Files\" podcast: \"The Republicans wanted Donald Trump for speaker. And they got him.\"\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press reporters Stephen Groves, Kevin Freking and Nicholas Riccardi contributed to this report.",

        "text": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Speaker Mike Johnson is negotiating with the White House as he prepares for the treacherous task of advancing wartime funding for Ukraine and Israel through the House, a top House Republican said Thursday.\n\nHouse Republican Leader Steve Scalise told reporters that Johnson had been talking with White House officials about a package that would deviate from the Senate's $95 billion foreign security package and include several Republican demands. It comes after Johnson has delayed for months on advancing aid that would provide desperately needed ammunition and weaponry for Kyiv, trying to find the right time to advance a package that will be a painful political lift.\n\n\"There's been no agreement reached,\" Scalise said. \"Obviously there would have to an agreement reached not just with the White House, but with our own members.\"\n\nJohnson, R-La., is being stretched between a Republican conference deeply divided in its support for Ukraine, as well as two presidential contenders at odds over the U.S.'s posture towards the rest of the world. President Joe Biden has repeatedly chastised Republicans for not helping Ukraine, saying they are doing the bidding of Russian President Vladimir Putin and hurting U.S. security. Meanwhile, Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican candidate, has said he would negotiate an end to the conflict as he tries to push the U.S. to a more isolationist stance.\n\nThe Republican speaker is set to travel to the former president's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on Friday to meet with Trump and has been consulting him in recent weeks on the Ukraine funding to gain his support -- or at least prevent him from openly opposing the package.\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican who often works closely with House lawmakers, said this week he and Trump have spoken with Johnson \"in depth\" about how to advance Ukraine aid. It is not clear whether Trump would lend any political support, but Mullin said he was hoping to get the former president behind the package, especially now that Johnson's job is at stake.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, has threatened to try to oust Johnson as speaker and warned that advancing funding for Ukraine would help build her case that GOP lawmakers should select a new speaker.\n\nMeanwhile, Johnson has been in conversations with the White House about legislation that would structure some of the funding for Kyiv as loans, pave the way for the U.S. to tap frozen Russian central bank assets and include other policy changes.\n\nJohnson has also been pushing for the Biden administration to lift a pause on approvals for Liquefied Natural Gas exports. At times, he has also demanded policy changes at the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\n\"This becomes a more dangerous world with Russia in Kyiv,\" said Rep. Don Bacon, a Republican who supports aiding Ukraine. \"So we're just got to find a the smart way to get a bill passed that we can get out and back to the Senate.\"\n\nStill, Johnson is facing a practically open rebellion from a group of hardline House conservatives who are dissatisfied with the way he has led the House. With a narrow and divided majority, Johnson has been forced to work with Democrats to advance practically any major legislation.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday that the \"only path forward\" for the House was a vote on the Senate's national security package. He also suggested that Democrats would help Johnson hold onto the speaker's gavel if he did so.\n\nWhile Democrats have pressured Johnson to put the Senate package to a vote, they also may be divided on a vote as a growing number oppose sending Israel offensive weaponry while it engages in a campaign in Gaza that has killed thousands of civilians.\n\nThe Biden administration, which would administer any military funding, has issued stern warnings to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that future U.S. support depends on the swift implementation of new steps to protect civilians and aid workers.\n\n\"If we want to prevent handing Putin a victory in Europe, the House should do the right thing for democracy and pass the Senate's aid package now,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Thursday in a floor speech.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Lisa Mascaro contributed.",

        "text": "We will take procurement decisions that will bolster our capabilities and protect our operational independence\n\nThe Royal Navy recently shot down a hostile threat for the first time since the First Gulf War. On 15 December 2023, in a matter of minutes, highly trained members of HMS Diamond's 200 strong company identified an aerial threat. They assessed it, selecting and preparing a Sea Viper missile, then calculated firing variables, sought and received authorisation, before launching and guiding the missile. It intercepted the target. It was a Houthi attack drone.\n\nI salute the professionalism and commitment of Royal Navy personnel working to restore security to the Red Sea as part of Operation Prosperity Guardian. In execution, their operation was flawless. But conceptually there was a flaw. Because we were required to use a sophisticated and expensive surface-to-air missile to shoot down a relatively cheap drone.\n\nFrom Nagorno Karabakh, to Ukraine, to the Red Sea, in a relatively short time frame cheap adaptable drones, often built from commercial components, have transformed the battlefield and the threat picture we face.\n\nIn Defence it is important to understand your vulnerabilities as well as your strengths. And it had been evident to me for some time that the old way of doing Defence procurement, with programmes rumbling-on sometimes for a decade or more, was no longer fit for purpose.\n\nSo I worked with the Defence Secretary to press fast-forward on a better solution that we had in the pipeline.\n\nDragonfire technology will engage aerial targets at the speed of light, for just \u00a310 a shot. And with our extra investment and agility, it will be operational on Royal Navy warships in 2027 rather than 2032.\n\nLast month The Telegraph editorial stated that Britain needed to reshape Defence procurement. I agree. And as a consequence of comprehensive reforms to Defence procurement that I initiated and came into force this week, this increased pace and agility will not be a one-off. It will be the norm in all future procurement programmes.\n\nOur new Integrated Procurement Model is a response to a more dangerous world and the lessons we've learned from Ukraine and previous acquisition programmes. Our overriding objective is to create and procure the newest and best capabilities for our Forces as quickly as we can. I've put targets in place to deliver battle winning capabilities in years rather than decades, helping us stay ahead of adversaries, bolster our supply chains, and strengthen our Defence sector.\n\nI have also dismantled procurement silos that had existed around the Army, Navy, and Air Force and replaced them with a spur to pan-defence prioritisation - based squarely on the threat we face. This will send clear signals to industry about where they need to ramp-up R&D and production capacity.\n\nFurthermore, I have introduced more rigour into the process to improve decision-making and deliver a genuine 'second opinion' for Ministers. Rather than wait years for gold-plated exquisite capabilities, I have embraced Minimum Deployable Capability in order to get game-changing kit quickly into service, knowing that we can 'spirally' adapt it in the future as needs evolve or technology advances.\n\nAnd because Putin's invasion of Ukraine has underlined the need to retain and build sovereign Defence capabilities, I am prioritising exportability from the outset of acquisition programmes, and incentivising UK manufacture in our decision-making processes, which will help strengthen the UK's Defence industrial base.\n\nThis new, faster and more agile approach requires a cultural change and a new and seamless relationship between customer and supplier. That change is happening, and we are building those relationships. We are already sharing secret data with trusted partner companies from wargaming exercises and Ukraine's front line.\n\nDragonfire is an exciting new capability embodying our new approach: rapidly procured, with red tape slashed; scientifically cutting edge; and, above all, sovereign, being the birth child of our own MoD scientists at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory.\n\nI want the Royal Navy to have use of it as soon as possible in order to keep global shipping lanes open and help keep household bills down. I will, therefore, take procurement decisions to rapidly develop other capabilities that will bolster our sovereign capabilities and protect our operational independence in a more warlike world.\n\nDragonfire illustrates the many different ways the professional and committed people who serve in the Armed Forces make our lives better. Our decision to accelerate its delivery shows how a smarter approach to procurement can simultaneously strengthen national security, our sovereign Defence industry, and the capabilities of our Armed Forces.\n\nJames Cartlidge MP is Minister of State for Defence Procurement",

        "title": "Marrying to avoid Russian Artillery",
        "text": "In a recent investigation conducted by NGL Media, an interesting trend has emerged in Ukraine amidst the ongoing conflict with Russia. It has been revealed that Ukrainian men of fighting age are actively seeking to evade compulsory military service by exploiting a loophole in the nation's martial law. These individuals are reportedly entering into sham marriages with disabled women. Such unions grant them a deferral from military duty by categorizing them as having a disabled dependent. Furthermore, this arrangement enables them to cross international borders, with many choosing to flee permanently. Social media platforms, including Facebook and Telegram, have become arenas for these transactions, with numerous groups dedicated to facilitating these marriages. Men post marriage proposals, while disabled women are propositioned to the highest bidders, often involving payments around \u20ac3,000. Additionally, intermediaries are profiting from this scheme, further highlighting the exploitation involved.\n\nIn a recent disclosure, Yevhen Filipets, a Ukrainian lawyer, conveyed to the media the rampant use of disability claims to obtain exemptions from military service. Filipets indicated that a staggering 95% of servicemen seeking discharge for family reasons cite disabilities within their immediate families as justification. The simplicity of obtaining such an exemption through marriage is alarming, highlighting a significant loophole in the system. According to Filipets, proving such marriages as fraudulent is exceedingly difficult, requiring court intervention -- a step unlikely to be taken by either spouse given the circumstances.\n\nCompounding the issue, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky recently enacted legislation lowering the conscription age from 27 to 25 years. This move aims to bolster military ranks in anticipation of continued aggression from Russia but also has the unintended consequence of drawing more young men away from an already beleaguered economy and into the conflict. The impact of this policy change is profound, as it intensifies the desperation of those seeking to evade military service, leading to extreme measures. Instances of violence against draft evaders, underscored by circulating videos of such individuals being forcefully removed and assaulted, reflect the severe societal tensions over conscription.\n\nThe toll of the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia is starkly illuminated by the grim reality that the average age of soldiers on the Ukrainian side has surpassed 40 years, reflecting the extensive human cost this war has exacted. The situation has grown increasingly dire, with casualties on the Ukrainian side surpassing a million to quote unofficial sources, necessitating the call-up of older personnel to fill the ranks. Amidst these developments, disturbing footage has surfaced, depicting the exploitation of mentally disabled individuals on the frontline, subject to ridicule by their counterparts. Such instances not only underscore the brutality of the conflict but also the desperate measures taken by Ukrainian regime to sustain military efforts.\n\nIn a stark assessment, General Rajmund Andrzejczak, former chief of the Polish General Staff, expressed a bleak outlook for Ukraine, suggesting that the scale of the loss far exceeds official reports, with potential casualties in the millions and a significant portion of the population unaccounted for. According to Andrzejczak, Ukraine faces an acute shortage of resources and manpower, leading to a grim conclusion that Ukraine is on the losing side of the conflict.\n\nCompounding the urgency, Edward Luttwak, a consultant for the US State Department, has voiced a stark warning: NATO allies may have no choice but to deploy their own forces to Ukraine or risk a devastating defeat. Reports indicate that key NATO members, including Britain and France, are already preparing for such an eventuality.",

        "title": "Kyrgyzstan ditches Russia for the US",
        "text": "Kyrgyzstan's decision to cease accepting Russia's Mir bank cards, as announced by the nation's local payments operator, marks a significant move within the Central Asian geopolitical landscape. This development, occurring last week, aligns with actions taken by most Kazakh banks and Armenia's formal cessation the previous month. It is noteworthy that Kyrgyzstan, unlike Kazakhstan's Western pivot and Armenia's NATO alignment, does not evidently harbor any antagonistic motives towards Russia.\n\nThe narrative surrounding Kyrgyzstan's relationship with the United States provides a backdrop to this financial decision. A discourse from last August highlighted claims of Kyrgyzstan being targeted for regime change by the U.S., primarily based on a letter from the then Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Bob Menendez, to Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov. The letter was interpreted as having an ulterior motive to destabilize Japarov's administration, allegedly under the guise of Kyrgyzstan's non-compliance with U.S. sanctions and purported regression in democratic and human rights norms. It must be noted that democracy and human rights are the most potent weapons in the American arsenal and are used when no real reasons exist.\n\nFurther complicating the bilateral relations, Kyrgyzstan's government has actively sought to counter perceived U.S. interference. Two months prior, President Japarov openly criticized a letter from U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, which expressed concerns over a proposed law in Kyrgyzstan resembling America's Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA). Japarov's staunch defense of his nation's sovereignty -- amid a history of color revolutions and the quest for stability -- underscored the tensions between Kyrgyzstan and U.S. policy directives, reflecting a broader narrative of geopolitical maneuvering and resistance to external influence in the region.\n\nKyrgyzstan's stance, under President Sadyr Japarov, exemplifies the delicate dance between maintaining strategic alliances and navigating the imposing pressures of global superpowers. Despite insinuations of unfriendly intentions towards Russia, Kyrgyzstan's cessation of accepting Russia's Mir bank cards, propelled by the looming threat of severe sanctions from the U.S., underscored a nuanced strategy of political resistance coupled with financial acquiescence. Japarov's forthcoming visit to the U.S., scheduled from April 14-20, aims to articulate Kyrgyzstan's inability to sever economic ties with Russia, signaling a reaffirmation of their strategic partnership amidst American skepticism and latent regime change ambitions. Also remember, my country India does everything and more that Kyrgyzstan has been doing but like a classroom bully, the US aims for weakest kid in the class.\n\nThis diplomatic endeavor, albeit potentially undoable against the backdrop of American foreign policy, underscores Kyrgyzstan's commitment to its sovereignty and the importance of Russia as a strategic ally. The development of the \"Southern Transport Corridor\" with Russia, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan further cements this alliance, showcasing a collective effort to ensure regional trade continuity in the face of potential disruptions. This initiative, born out of mutual trust and strategic foresight, highlights the interconnectedness of regional politics and the value of diplomatic hedging.\n\nCriticism from certain quarters of the Alternative Media Community regarding Kyrgyzstan's decision to discontinue the Mir bank card might be premature or misplaced. This action, while unfortunate, is a pragmatic response to an untenable situation, balancing financial vulnerability with political steadfastness. Kyrgyzstan's approach, characterized by a blend of diplomacy and strategic partnerships, demonstrates a keen awareness of its geopolitical position and a nuanced understanding of the limits and possibilities within the complex web of international relations.",

There's no evidence of significant numbers of immigrants violating that law by casting illegal ballots.\n\nSome liberal cities like San Francisco have begun to allow noncitizens to vote in a few local elections, leading Republicans to argue there need to be even more laws forbidding it in federal elections.\n\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said he was supportive of those proposals. \"How do you ensure that noncitizens are not voting? That's that's what this is all about.\"\n\nWith his majority shrinking due to early retirements and departures, Johnson is operating as a speaker in name only. But the more he depends on Democrats to provide the votes needed to pass substantial legislation, including last month's bills to keep the government from shutting down, the deeper trouble he courts from the MAGA Republicans.\n\nTrump could help Johnson by promoting the House's legislative priorities or, at least, not torpedoing them. But that seems increasingly uncertain as the presumed presidential nominee leads the GOP in a different direction on both domestic and foreign policy priorities.\n\nTired of the infighting and wary of another dragged-out brawl like the monthlong slugfest to replace McCarthy, few Republicans are backing Greene's effort to remove Johnson, for now.\n\n\"Marjorie's actions are horrific,\" said Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, a former Trump administration official. \"They are childish. They are petulant. They have no place here in this body.\"\n\nBut if Trump signals otherwise, that could all change.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker emeritus, said this week on \"The Axe Files\" podcast: \"The Republicans wanted Donald Trump for speaker. And they got him.\"\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press reporters Stephen Groves, Kevin Freking and Nicholas Riccardi contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Armenia's NATO Disaster",
        "text": "First a little bit of history and context - It's a bit of a head-scratcher, really. NATO, historically, hasn't meshed well with Orthodox Christian countries, with a list including Russia, Serbia, Belarus and others. Analysts typically don't pin this friction on religious differences, yet here we are. Armenia, steeped in its own Orthodox traditions, is in a peculiar spot. Turkey, a heavyweight in NATO and a nation with a dark historical chapter involving Armenia, complicates things further. Then there's the simmering tension with Azerbaijan over Nagorno Karabakh, with Turkey backing Azerbaijan. Russia, expected to be Armenia's big brother in times of need, offered support during the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, but it left Armenia wanting more. So, the idea of Armenia flirting with the idea of joining NATO, almost as a defiant gesture towards Russia, sounds like something out of a political satire. Yet, here we are, witnessing these unexpected twists in international relations.\n\nArmenia's current peace with its neighbors starkly contrasts with the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia. This distinction raises questions about the rationale behind Armenia and NATO's preparations for potential hostilities when there are no evident disputes with other nations. Unlike Ukraine, which has received \"security guarantees\" from several NATO members, including promises of military support in case of renewed conflict with Russia, Armenia's situation is markedly different. These agreements with Ukraine are an extension of previous support and have been portrayed by Kiev as significant military-strategic developments, despite their continuity with existing policies.\n\nArmenia's context diverges notably from Ukraine's due to its lack of active conflict and its complicated relationship with NATO. Despite officially being part of the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) and having its participation unofficially suspended, Russia has reassured Armenia of its mutual defense commitments should its sovereignty be threatened. The geographical challenge of being landlocked further complicates potential support from NATO, similar to what Ukraine has received.\n\nComplicating matters further, Armenia views NATO member Turkey as a potential threat. The logistics of supporting Armenia militarily are fraught with difficulties, as it is improbable that Turkey, possessing NATO's second-largest military force, would facilitate arms transfers through its territory against its own interests. The feasible alternative would involve routes through the Black Sea and Georgia, strategies that could only be implemented during peacetime and would necessitate prior stockpiling in those regions. This scenario highlights the distinct strategic and geopolitical challenges facing Armenia in the context of its security and international relations, diverging significantly from the situation in Ukraine.\n\nThe narrative surrounding Armenia's pursuit of \"security guarantees\" from NATO is intriguing, especially given its current peaceful status with neighbors and the recent conflict with Azerbaijan. The speculation that Armenia seeks these guarantees due to a lack of confidence in Russia's protection raises eyebrows. This quest for assurances could hint at Armenia's potential interest in transitioning from the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) to a closer alignment with NATO, despite official statements to the contrary. The logic behind such a move is rooted in Armenia's recent military challenges and the complex geopolitical landscape it navigates.\n\nThe intention behind seeking NATO's security guarantees might be to facilitate a smoother shift in Armenia's strategic alliances, mirroring Ukraine's de facto NATO relationship, albeit without the direct conflict backdrop. This proactive preparation for possible future conflicts, despite no immediate territorial disputes, suggests a strategic positioning rather than an immediate response to aggression. The implication is that Armenia and NATO could be contemplating measures to enhance their geopolitical stance, potentially at Azerbaijan's expense.\n\nThis situation leads to a complex web of strategic miscalculations, where Armenia, possibly feeling cornered after its recent conflict losses, might seek to strengthen its position through alliances. The theoretical scenario of a conflict with Azerbaijan, under the guise of \"self-defense,\" could serve as a dramatic pivot in the region's security dynamics. Azerbaijan, recognizing the gravity of these maneuvers, is keen on border delineation to preempt any justifications for renewed hostilities. The undercurrent of these developments points to a delicate balance of power, national aspirations, and the shadow of external influences shaping the future of regional stability. Such a fraught path underscores the intricate dance of diplomacy, security, and the pursuit of national interests in a world where alliances and guarantees play pivotal roles.",

        "text": "The level of new construction starting in China is nearly quadruple what it was in 2019, when the country hit a nine-year annual low of entirely new coal power stations starting.\n\nNew coal capacity starting construction shown in GW for China (red line) and the rest of the world (orange line). Credit: GEM.\n\nThis is the fourth year in a row that the amount of new coal construction starting has increased in China. This is out of line with President Xi Jinping's 2021 pledge to \"strictly control\" new coal power capacity, GEM states.\n\nIn early 2022, China's National Energy Administration's 14th five\u2010year plan for a \"modern energy system\" stated that 30GW of coal power would be retired by 2025.\n\nHowever, when counting larger coal units with capacity of at least 30 megawatts, less than 9GW of power plants have been shut down in the last three years, and few others have plans to retire, GEM notes.\n\nIf China is to meet this 30GW retirement target, it \"needs to take immediate action\", GEM adds.\n\nCoal's fortunes this year are an anomaly, as all signs point to reversing course from this accelerated expansion. But countries that have coal plants to retire need to do so more quickly, and countries that have plans for new coal plants must make sure these are never built.\n\nFlora Champenois, coal programme director, Global Energy Monitor\n\nIn a statement, Qi Qin, China analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, said:\n\n\"The recent surge in coal power development in China starkly contrasts with the global trend, putting China's 2025 climate targets at risk. At this pivotal juncture, it is crucial for China to impose stricter controls on coal power projects and expedite the transition towards renewable energy to realign with its climate commitments.\"\n\nCollectively, China, India, Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Laos, Turkey, Russia, Pakistan and Vietnam account for 95 per cent of global pre-construction capacity, according to the GEM report.\n\nThe 5 per cent remaining is distributed among 21 countries, the tracker finds. Of these, 11 have one project and are on the brink of achieving the \"no new coal\" milestone, it adds.\n\nThe tracker identifies 20.9GW of entirely new coal power proposals outside of China in 2023. This was led by India, which saw 11.4GW of new coal capacity proposed, more than any year since 2016. This was in part due to the revival of several stalled projects in the country, GEM explains.\n\nKazakhstan also saw 4.6GW of new proposals and Indonesia saw 2.5GW. Some 4.1GW of previously shelved or cancelled capacity is now considered \"proposed\" again.\n\nAnother handful of countries - Russia, the Philippines, Botswana and Nigeria - also saw revived proposals and construction restarting in 2023.\n\nGlobally, a total of 69.5GW of coal power came online in 2023, while 21.1GW was retired, GEM finds. This led to the highest net increase in global operating coal capacity since 2016, with a 48.4GW jump.\n\nNew capacity also came online in Indonesia (5.9GW), India (5.5GW), Vietnam (2.6GW), Japan (2.5GW), Bangladesh (1.9GW), Pakistan (1.7GW), South Korea (1GW), Greece (0.7GW) and Zimbabwe (0.3GW).\n\nIn total during 2023, the tracker found 22.1GW came online and 17.4GW was retired outside of China. This resulted in a 4.7GW net increase in the world's coal fleet operating outside China. Globally, coal power capacity reached 2,130GW in 2023, up from 2 per cent a year earlier.\n\nThe US contributed nearly half of coal power retirements, GEM says, with 9.7GW shuttering in 2023. However, this is a drop in retirements from 14.7GW in 2022, and a peak of 21.7GW in 2015.\n\nElsewhere, the EU and UK represented nearly a quarter of retirements, with 3.1GW closing in the UK, 0.6GW in Italy and 0.5GW in Poland. There is now just one operating coal-fired power plant in the UK, with the Ratcliffe-on-Soar set to close in September 2024.\n\nOverall, global coal power plant retirements were at their lowest level since 2011, as the figure below shows.",

        "title": "Ukraine's Drone Strikes Against Russian Oil Refineries Complicate Biden's Re-Election Bid - Russia News Now",
        "text": "CNN published a detailed piece on Tuesday about how \"Ukraine's AI-enabled drones are trying to disrupt Russia's energy industry. So far, it's working\". Although an unnamed source close to the program told them that \"The flights are determined in advance with our allies, and the aircraft follow the flight plan to enable us to strike targets with meters of precision\", there are reasons to believe that the US is against these sorts of attacks. Not least among them is what CNN itself reported in that same piece.\n\nAccording to them, \"Ukrainian strikes on refineries have caused global oil prices to rise, with Brent crude up nearly 13% this year, leaving politicians in the United States worried about their potential economic impact in an important election year.\" They also cited an expert who claimed, \"That was the deal with Ukraine: We will give you money, we will give you weapons, but stay away from the export facility, stay away from Russian energy, because we don't want a massive energy crisis.\"\n\nThat individual added in reference to the Congressional deadlock on Ukraine aid that \"If they're not getting the weapons and money that they were promised, what is their incentive to abide by that deal with Washington?\" This aligns with what Zelensky himself hinted in an interview with the Washington Post late last month when he revealed that \"The reaction of the US was not positive on [us attacking Russian oil refineries]...(but) We used our drones. Nobody can say to us you can't.\"\n\nSecretary of State Blinken echoed that sentiment in a joint press conference with his French counterpart on Tuesday when he said in response to a question about these oil refinery strikes that \"we have neither supported nor enabled strikes by Ukraine outside of its territory.\" He was asked about this after a Ukrainian drone strike targeted Russia's third-largest refinery in the Republic of Tatarstan, which is located in the country's heartland a full 800 miles away from the front lines.\n\nWhen reflecting on Blinken's statement, CNN's report, and Zelensky's earlier words, it certainly appears to be the case that the US doesn't want Ukraine striking Russian oil refineries out of fear that the massive energy crisis that this could catalyze would capsize Biden's re-election bid.\n\nIf that's indeed its position, then it raises the question of which allies are determining the flight paths of these drones and why Zelensky would risk Trump returning to power when he's much less pro-Ukrainian than Biden is.\n\nIt might very well be the case that there are divisions emerging within NATO over these strikes exactly as RT editorialized when drawing attention to how Blinken's French counterpart seemed to support the latest attacks in his response to the question that they were asked during Tuesday's press conference. France might therefore be providing this sort of assistance, which could also be complemented by the UK's and other countries' complementary contributions, whether on their own or as part of a joint effort.\n\nAs for why Zelensky would want to rankle Biden and risk Trump's return, he might have a \"god complex\" after being promoted so heavily as a Churchillian leader over the past two years, which could have become part of his identity despite the media souring on him since last summer. In his mind, Biden will do his bidding in somehow getting the Republicans to approve more Ukraine aid under pain of him unleashing a massive energy crisis by taking out more of Russia's refining and export capabilities.\n\nBiden would have already gotten the Republicans to do this if he was able to so it's delusional for Zelensky to imagine that holding his re-election bid hostage will make a positive difference. If anything, wider awareness his thuggish tactics among the Republicans could further solidify their resistance to approving more Ukraine aid since Zelensky isn't just holding Biden's re-election bid hostage, but the entire American economy as well and therefore also threatening the US' objective national interests.\n\nShould he authorize a series of strikes that catalyzes the massive energy crisis that the Biden Administration fears, then the most hawkish anti-Russian deep state faction that's responsible for artificially perpetuating this conflict might lose the influence that it exerts over policymakers. Their comparatively less hawkish rivals could replace their dominant role in that scenario and possibly convince the Biden Administration to finally agree to a pragmatic compromise for ending the conflict.",

        "text": "The spring flooding due to the melting of snows at the end of winter are considered to be normal in Russian Siberia and in Kazakhstan across the border in Asia. But this year the flooding took a disastrous turn with many of the rivers in Russia flowing into Kazakhstan and rivers from Kazakhstan flowing north into Russia overflowed their banks, and thousands of homes were destroyed in the two countries, and many thousands of people have become homeless.\n\nAccording to a Reuters report quoting Russian news agencies, 97,000 people in Kazakhstan were evacuated and in Russia 12,000 were evacuated, while more than 10,000 homes were flooded on the Russian side and more than 3,000 on the Kazakh side. The concern is greater because the Russian territory which is flooded is the wheat bowl of Russia, and Russia's wheat exports are crucial for many countries in the Middle East and in Africa.\n\nIt is being said that the reason for flooding on a such large scale could be due to the rising spring temperatures that led to a swift melting of the snows, and also the land was already soggy because of rains in winter which then solidified as snow as temperatures dropped. The experts are as yet hesitating to link this event to climate change. But they are referring to the fact that a research team of the United States' National Intelligence Council had commissioned research on the impact of climate change on Russia by 2030. The report that was based on the research indicated that there would be extreme weather events, which in would cause forest fires, floods and rise in temperatures.\n\nThe area affected by the floods in Russia includes the Ural mountain region, Siberia. In Kazakhstan, areas in the north and east were affected. The Ural River which rises in the Ural Mountains, flows through Kazakhstan's industrial hub and joins the Caspian Sea. A Russian official in the region blamed the Kazakhs for not releasing the water from the reservoirs of dams built along the rivers. The Russian region of Western Siberia, which is one of the areas inundated by the floods, is home to the largest hydrocarbon basin, and Russia is one of the largest oil exporters to the world. The oil refinery at Orsk in the region has been closed. It processed 90,000 barrels per day of oil last year. There are indeed strategic implications of the flood situation in the area.\n\nNot much attention has been paid on the impact of climate change in Russia, especially in the Ural region, in Siberia, and the Central Asian republics like Kazakhstan bordering Russia. Many of the climate experts have noticed the drying up of the Aral Sea in Uzbekistan at a rapid rate. But flooding has not been reckoned as a possible extreme weather event in the region. Regional authorities in Russia and Kazakhstan affected by the floods are responding with the rescue measures.\n\nPerhaps it would be hasty to connect the issue of climate change with the flooding in Russia and Kazakhstan. This could be a one-off event, which could occur at infrequent times. But there is no denying the fact that Russia would be affected by the rapid melting of the Arctic ice to its north, and this would impact not just the polar regions of Russia, but the rest of the country in the southern part, especially on the Asian and European sides. This would require in the climate change programmes, the participation of Russia becomes crucial because it would impact the lives and economies of people in other parts of the world. Geopolitical rivalries could prove to be counterproductive.",

President Joe Biden has repeatedly chastised Republicans for not helping Ukraine, saying they are doing the bidding of Russian President Vladimir Putin and hurting U.S. security.

        "title": "Gavin Esler: Let's fix things now rather than fearing for the future",
        "text": "Gavin Esler is a columnist for The Irish News and a former presenter of Newsnight and author of books including Britain Is Better Than This.\n\nMany of us will remember that during the early years of the Troubles, loyalist strikes caused power cuts across Northern Ireland.\n\nMy parents lived in County Antrim and my father always prepared for disruption. Our family loved camping, so we had a portable gas stove, torches and gas-powered lights on stand-by.\n\nMy father would also - like everyone else - fill up the car with petrol and make sure tinned food was stocked in the kitchen cupboard, just in case. Nobody made a big deal of this. It was common sense.\n\nMore recently - and perhaps more on the fringes of common sense - there are those who seem to think we need to prepare for something bigger: the End Times and Doomsday.\n\nThey call themselves \"Preppers\", preparing for something much worse than the lights going out for a few days. They are preparing for the lights going out for all of us, forever.\n\nBritain's Daily Mail newspaper headlined a recent \"prepper\" story this way: \"Meet Britain's growing army of women preppers readying for WW3 - and why they think YOU should do the same.\"\n\nThe newspaper featured Dr Sarita Robinson - sometimes known as Dr Survival - at her home in Preston, Lancashire. In preparation for World War Three, the Mail account said she keeps \"several months\" supply of toilet rolls and a \"three-month supply of food under the stairs including milk powder, flour for bread making, a huge sack of rice, drinking water\" and other necessities.\n\nDr Robinson always has her mobile phone handy \"in case we should receive the government's emergency warning alarm that an attack is imminent\". She and her husband 'have a plan in place with our adult children as to where we would each seek refuge and meet up, depending on where we all were in the country at the time\".\n\nPerhaps some may find Dr Survival's advice useful. But I'm sceptical. I suspect World War Three involves Russia, France, the UK, the United States, and possibly China. These powers have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all human life on Earth forever. WW3 might therefore be the kind of conflict in which Dr Robinson and the rest of us find baking bread, flushing the toilet or charging mobile phones to be problematic.\n\nEven now, in peacetime, across England, flushing the toilet seems to result not so much in waste disposal as in sewage rearrangement, polluting our waterways and seas. The recent Oxford-Cambridge boat race included warnings to crews not to jump into the polluted River Thames because of the risk of swallowing filthy water.\n\nThese are real risks right now. World War Three is of course a risk for our future but surviving it is going to take more than a sack of rice in the cupboard and a few multi-packs of soft toilet tissue.\n\nYet despite my scepticism, the \"prepper\" idea is infectious. And profitable. I did a recent reporting assignment about GB News. I found the channel amateurish, embarrassing and incredibly boring to watch, full of weird scare stories about Islam and nonsense about \"wokery\".\n\nBut GB News viewer comments were more interesting. They were full of paranoia and fears about the future. One viewer said: \"I'm a prepper. I prep for societal collapse. I'd advise anyone with any sense to start thinking about doing the same.\"\n\nSome people therefore really are preparing for World War Three with extra shopping for food and toilet rolls, while others predict \"societal collapse\" and still others have found a way of making money from all this.\n\nI discovered that a number of what used to be called \"camping shops\" or \"outdoors outfitters\" have rebranded themselves to cater for survivalists and \"preppers\". One online ad promises \"the cheapest rations you'll find in the world\". Another offers body armour, although I can't see how that would be helpful in a nuclear holocaust.\n\nThen there are bulk-buy boxes of military rations (including 50 packs of dried fruit and nuts) and even a handy kit for surviving a nuclear winter that you can keep in your car, alongside the de-icer and the washer fluid.\n\nWorld War Three is of course a risk for our future but surviving it is going to take more than a sack of rice in the cupboard and a few multi-packs of soft toilet tissue\n\nBack in the real world, perhaps what would be helpful would be to \"prep\" to fix real problems that affect us right now. Like - say - the lack of NHS dentists, nurses, midwives and doctors, the underfunding of universities, the abysmal state of roads, under-achieving schools, the rail strikes and... all the other real world problems facing us in 2024.\n\nSurely fixing NOW rather than fearing the future would make us all less paranoid and more happy?\n\nI could be wrong, of course. It could indeed be the End Times. But if I'm wrong, you won't be around to correct me, will you? And neither will I.",

        "title": "Stalin Rains on Ewan McGregor's Parade in 'A Gentleman in Moscow'",
        "text": "At the beginning of A Gentleman in Moscow's episode, Alexander (Ewan McGregor) stands at the edge of the Metropol Hotel's roof. He looks like he's about to jump into the night. Those godforsaken communists are ruining everything! Right before he can make that fatal tumble, though, we go back in time -- from Alexander's 1,667th day at the hotel back to his 1,638th day. Let's see how he got to this low point during his stay at the Metropol.\n\nWe're back on the roof; now, it's daytime, and Alexander is happily stretching. Up atop the building, the Count meets Abram (Dermot Crowley), the roof's caretaker who takes a liking to Alexander. The pair share a sliver of honeycomb off Abram's beehive while fretting about the sounds of explosions going off in the distance. Outside, we learn, Russia has crumbled following the death of Lenin. But inside the Metropol Hotel, all is...well, strained, but still somewhat alright.\n\nAn older Nina (Leah Balmforth) visits Alexander at the hotel. The pair bond over some chess and more fiery arguments -- since Nina has aged up, she's developed her own opinions. The pair discuss whether or not Napoleon would've ever been able to conquer Europe. Sasha thinks that, yes, if he didn't have those weird maternal issues, he'd have been able to. But Nina believes that, in any circumstance, the people would've risen to take him down.\n\nThis Celebrity Couple Makes a Seductive Debut in 'A Gentleman in Moscow'\n\nAnna (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is still at the hotel after the pair's first encounter long ago, but she and Alexander haven't spoken to one another since the hookup. Alexander slips her notes across the hotel. She ignores his advances. At this point in her career, Anna is a big movie star -- she doesn't have time for a man who is trapped in a hotel holding cage.\n\nLater, the Count learns from Mishka (Fehinti Balogun) that his grandmother has passed away in England. No funeral was held. Distraught, Alexander starts to plan a party of his own at the Metropol, where he'll invite a handful of friends to one last opulent evening of celebration for the late Countess Rostov. He's the last Rostov remaining. It's Alexander's duty to send her off in style.\n\nEveryone warns Alexander against this party. It's far too gauche for Moscow's current environment, in which the rich are murdered at the will of the people, and Alexander's already on thin ice. Mishka is especially peeved when he receives an invitation to the party. It shouldn't be happening, he tells Alexander. But Alexander wants to rebuild Moscow as a place for people of all wealths. \"Rome wasn't built in a day,\" Mishka warns.\n\n\"No,\" Alexander agrees, \"but it was burnt down in one.\" Alexander has had it with the lesser classes taking over his nobility. That's enough! Let him eat cake.\n\nAt that very same bar some moments later, Alexander notices some room service being sent up to Anna's and takes a chance: He'll deliver the food and make another pass at Anna. Anna's longtime servant Olga (Anastasia Hille) is peeved to see Alexander and almost sends him away, but Anna tells her to leave them to it. Over some champagne, Alexander asks why Anna never called him to her room again. Anna's excuse? She was always around, but Alexander never came to see her. All he had to do was knock on her door. The two pounce on each other.\n\nThat'll be the last good news for Alexander and the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day, because as soon as the Count returns to the real world, he learns some awful news. Not only have demonstrators torn up the Imperial Gardens of Russia, but the Metropol Hotel has also banned wine. WHAT?! Okay, well, not all wine. After Alexander orders a barolo, he's shocked to find the hotel only offers house red and white. The labels have all been torn off -- essentially, you get what you get.\n\nThis major update sets the tone for Alexander's party to send off his late grandmother. On top of the wine dilemma, Stalin is rumored to be visiting the hotel tonight in honor of Anna's big movie premiere. Communist party flags and big photos of Stalin are hung from every balcony in the Metropol. Even Nina is helping to hang the banners. This isn't exactly what Alexander had in mind for his celebration -- but c'est la vie. The party will go on.\n\nEwan McGregor and His Mustache Debuts in 'Gentleman in Moscow'\n\nOr...will it? Only one guest -- Mishka -- shows up for Alexander's party. Everyone is too scared to be caught attending such a soiree when Stalin himself may be at the Metropol. Mishka tries to make Alexander understand this, but the Count simply can't. When Nina appears, defending Stalin and slamming Alexander for whining about the wine, the party really takes a turn for the worse. After both Mishka and Nina storm out on account of Alexander's bad behavior, all of the food is wasted. Alexander wants to make the case for building back Russia, but this is pretty foul behavior, and an example of why the country can't go back to what it was before.\n\nThe turnout really gets to Alexander, who storms up to the roof. Here we are, day 1,667, in the bleak middle of winter, where Alexander wants to end his life out of agony. Luckily, right as he's about to jump off, Abram invites him for some tea in his corner of the roof. Sweet Abram tells Alexander he's too young to waste his life -- there's still a lot of living to do.\n\nAlexander isn't the only one who's had his night ruined by the communists. Anna is wrecked after Stalin doesn't make an appearance at her movie -- he wasn't interested enough to show up. Bummer...I guess? Alexander and Anna drink away their disappointment and grab each other in the elevator. So, all in all: The night wasn't that bad. At least they have each other.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox. Sign up now.",

        "title": "I heard you, and am arming Britain for a more warlike world",
        "text": "The Royal Navy recently shot down a hostile threat for the first time since the First Gulf War. On 15 December 2023, in a matter of minutes, highly trained members of HMS Diamond's 200 strong company identified an aerial threat. They assessed it, selecting and preparing a Sea Viper missile, then calculated firing variables, sought and received authorisation, before launching and guiding the missile. It intercepted the target. It was a Houthi attack drone.\n\nI salute the professionalism and commitment of Royal Navy personnel working to restore security to the Red Sea as part of Operation Prosperity Guardian. In execution, their operation was flawless. But conceptually there was a flaw. Because we were required to use a sophisticated and expensive surface-to-air missile to shoot down a relatively cheap drone.\n\nFrom Nagorno Karabakh, to Ukraine, to the Red Sea, in a relatively short time frame cheap adaptable drones, often built from commercial components, have transformed the battlefield and the threat picture we face.\n\nIn Defence it is important to understand your vulnerabilities as well as your strengths. And it had been evident to me for some time that the old way of doing Defence procurement, with programmes rumbling-on sometimes for a decade or more, was no longer fit for purpose.\n\nSo I worked with the Defence Secretary to press fast-forward on a better solution that we had in the pipeline.\n\nDragonfire technology will engage aerial targets at the speed of light, for just \u00a310 a shot. And with our extra investment and agility, it will be operational on Royal Navy warships in 2027 rather than 2032.\n\nLast month The Telegraph editorial stated that Britain needed to reshape Defence procurement. I agree. And as a consequence of comprehensive reforms to Defence procurement that I initiated and came into force this week, this increased pace and agility will not be a one-off. It will be the norm in all future procurement programmes.\n\nOur new Integrated Procurement Model is a response to a more dangerous world and the lessons we've learned from Ukraine and previous acquisition programmes. Our overriding objective is to create and procure the newest and best capabilities for our Forces as quickly as we can. I've put targets in place to deliver battle winning capabilities in years rather than decades, helping us stay ahead of adversaries, bolster our supply chains, and strengthen our Defence sector.\n\nI have also dismantled procurement silos that had existed around the Army, Navy, and Air Force and replaced them with a spur to pan-defence prioritisation - based squarely on the threat we face. This will send clear signals to industry about where they need to ramp-up R&D and production capacity.\n\nFurthermore, I have introduced more rigour into the process to improve decision-making and deliver a genuine 'second opinion' for Ministers. Rather than wait years for gold-plated exquisite capabilities, I have embraced Minimum Deployable Capability in order to get game-changing kit quickly into service, knowing that we can 'spirally' adapt it in the future as needs evolve or technology advances.\n\nAnd because Putin's invasion of Ukraine has underlined the need to retain and build sovereign Defence capabilities, I am prioritising exportability from the outset of acquisition programmes, and incentivising UK manufacture in our decision-making processes, which will help strengthen the UK's Defence industrial base.\n\nThis new, faster and more agile approach requires a cultural change and a new and seamless relationship between customer and supplier. That change is happening, and we are building those relationships. We are already sharing secret data with trusted partner companies from wargaming exercises and Ukraine's front line.\n\nDragonfire is an exciting new capability embodying our new approach: rapidly procured, with red tape slashed; scientifically cutting edge; and, above all, sovereign, being the birth child of our own MoD scientists at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory.\n\nI want the Royal Navy to have use of it as soon as possible in order to keep global shipping lanes open and help keep household bills down. I will, therefore, take procurement decisions to rapidly develop other capabilities that will bolster our sovereign capabilities and protect our operational independence in a more warlike world.\n\nDragonfire illustrates the many different ways the professional and committed people who serve in the Armed Forces make our lives better. Our decision to accelerate its delivery shows how a smarter approach to procurement can simultaneously strengthen national security, our sovereign Defence industry, and the capabilities of our Armed Forces.\n\nJames Cartlidge MP is Minister of State for Defence Procurement",

According to sources within the Mumbai Congress, the unit has complained against state Congress chief Nana Patole for overlooking the party's interests in seat-sharing talks. Out of the six seats in the Mumbai region, Congress will contest two seats -- Mumbai North Central and Mumbai North seats. While Mumbai Congress chief Varsha Gaikwad refused to criticise any party leader, she accepted that the leaders involved in negotiations should have been more aggressive for Mumbai.\n\nWith the Congress having fielded the controversial Choudhary Lal Singh, who had publicly supported the accused in the 2018 gang rape and murder of a minor Bakerwal girl in Kathua, from Udhampur-Doda, its allies have been forced to go back on their criticism of him. The Congress, which had demanded stern action against the Kathua accused at the time, reinducted Lal Singh into its fold last month before giving him a ticket from Udhampur, a seat Lal Singh had won in the past. The party wavered over the issue, finally giving in as it could not find any other winnable candidate.\n\nIn other news: Months after zeroing in on 15 suspects, publicly releasing their photographs, and issuing lookout notices for them for alleged involvement in the violence at the Indian High Commission in London during a protest on March 19 last year, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has now determined that at least three persons from Punjab were wrongly identified. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) issued Look Out Circulars (LOCs) against 15 people, who were identified from five videos of the violence. These videos were procured by an NIA team during its visit to the United Kingdom in May last year to investigate the incident and a suspected terror link involving Pakistan's ISI.\n\nAlmost three months after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy asked Switzerland to do so, the Swiss government Thursday announced it proposes to host a conference, at the level of heads of state, that \"aims to provide a platform for a high-level dialogue on ways to reach a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine based on international law and the UN Charter\". The proposed dates are June 15 and 16 at the B\u00fcrgenstock Hotel above Lake Lucerne in central Switzerland. This is timed to ensure maximum attendance -- the G7 leaders' summit will be held on June 13-15 in Borgo Egnazia in Apulia, Italy. India has also been invited to the peace conference.\n\nMoving on to top international news: OJ Simpson, who ran to fame on the football field, made fortunes as a Black all-American in movies, advertising and television and was acquitted of killing his former wife and her friend in a 1995 trial in Los Angeles that mesmerised the nation, died Wednesday. He was 76. The cause was cancer, his family announced on social media. The announcement did not say where he died. The infamous case, which held up a cracked mirror to Black and white America, cleared Simpson but ruined his world.\n\nIn news from Russia: Nearly 12,000 houses have been flooded in a Russian region bordering Kazakhstan as water levels in the Ural River keep rising and threatening more deluge, authorities said on Thursday. The floods sparked evacuations of thousands in the Orenburg region, located some 1,200 kilometres (745 miles), southeast of the capital of Moscow after a dam on the river burst last week under the pressure of surging waters. Local authorities have declared a state of emergency in the region. In a televised videoconference with President Vladimir Putin, Orenburg governor Denis Pasler reported that a total of 11,972 houses were flooded, as well as 16 state medical facilities.\n\nIn news from Maldives: In an apparent bid to woo Indian tourists back to the Maldives, a major tourism body here has announced that it will hold road shows across key Indian cities. As the number of Indian tourists to the Maldives continues to decline, the Maldives Association of Travel Agents and Tour Operators held discussions with India's High Commissioner here, Munu Mahawar, on enhancing travel and tourism cooperation between the two countries. A full-blown backlash was directed at the Maldives following derogatory remarks against India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on social media by three Maldivian officials after Modi posted photos and video of the pristine Lakshadweep Islands on India's west coast on January 6 on his X handle.\n\nLastly: The wife of Julian Assange said on Thursday her husband's legal case \"could be moving in the right direction\" after President Joe Biden confirmed the US may drop charges against the imprisoned WikiLeaks founder. It came as supporters in several cities rallied to demand the release of Assange, on the fifth anniversary of his incarceration in London's high-security Belmarsh prison. Biden said on Wednesday that his administration is \"considering\" a request from Australia to drop the decade-long US push to prosecute Assange for publishing a trove of classified American documents. The proposal would see Assange, an Australian citizen, return home rather than be sent to the US to face espionage charges.",

        "title": "COMMENT: The Three Seas Initiative's digital imperative",
        "text": "The Greenergy Data Center in Tallinn is the region's biggest and most energy-efficient data centre. / Greenergy Data Centers\n\nThe ever-evolving digital sphere presents unique challenges for Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). In an era where technology is being increasingly weaponised and the new limits of artificial intelligence, cyber security and data privacy are yet to be tested and understood, these challenges must be addressed and confronted head-on.\n\nHaving relatively developed digital connectivity infrastructure, the largest CEE countries still lag behind their Western counterparts in terms of internet access and e-service proliferation. Within the connectivity umbrella, e-commerce is a sector that is rapidly catching up with the West, and is now starting to find its footing in the region. However, all these factors point to the need for quality infrastructure to meet the growing demand.\n\nPressingly, the region finds itself on the frontline of escalating cyber attacks, particularly in light of Russia's aggression in Ukraine and continued threats. The significance of these threats cannot be understated; we are preparing for a proliferation of digital services and e-support across CEE, from the public sector to industrial supply chains, and this comes with added responsibility for security.\n\nEnter the Three Seas Initiative (3SI). Since its inception in 2015, it has strategically prioritised digital connectivity across 13 CEE member states as one of its key pillars, along with sustainability and infrastructure development. Understanding the transformative potential of digitalisation in driving economic growth is just the start: the 3SI's push for smart connectivity hopes to link the energy and transport infrastructure with digital services, to create a fully integrated, modern-day solution for the region's citizens and companies alike.\n\nAccelerated growth necessitates infrastructure expansion\n\nAs the region's leaders convened for the annual Three Seas Summit this week, the location and timing of the gathering couldn't have been more convenient. Vilnius is a city rapidly gaining a reputation for its digital advancements, and represents a cluster of countries that have been CEE's shining beacon for digitalisation efforts.\n\nThe event has attracted key government and private sector leaders that have accelerated the Baltic's push into the digital age, in addition to major global tech giants such as Apple, IBM and Meta, among others. Given the 3SI strongly emphasises the development of north-south connectivity, the summit serves as a catalyst to share experiences and spur collaboration with less savvy corners of the continent.\n\nWhen we secured our mandate to manage the Three Seas Initiative Investment Fund (3SIIF) four years ago, we recognised that developing sustainable digital infrastructure must be front-and-centre of our mission. The growth of e-services and the rise of e-commerce are among the driving factors; while digital infrastructure in the region is growing, support infrastructure designed to handle the growth in demand is what requires investment. Higher demand for e-services and digital products naturally requires more data processing capacity, something we are looking to capitalise on.\n\nA prime example of our work in this area is our flagship project in Estonia, to develop the next generation of sustainable data centres. Nestled on the outskirts of Tallinn, known for its vibrant tech ecosystem, the Greenergy Data Center is an architectural and technological marvel. It is the region's biggest and most energy-efficient data centre, spanning 14,500 square metres and a capacity potential of 31.5 MW. With AI technologies, it ensures over 25% higher energy efficiency than predecessors. It is a marker for the region, and a statement of intent that capacity and security are at the heart of our investment plans, to bring connectivity safely to the people within 3SI regions and beyond.\n\nCommercialisation of the facility is no longer limited to large multinationals with near-unlimited budgets, but also regional entrepreneurs harnessing a local network, ensuring that our path toward digitisation continues to develop within. Through these networks, we can continue to grow capacity to serve demand that is likely to increase exponentially.\n\nAbove all, it signifies optimism, and for Thursday's summit, it is the most powerful perception to keep discussions - and investments - flowing. It is incumbent upon us to not just finish what we started, but nurture it and grow it to a position where CEE represents the gold standard of intra-regional connectivity. The Three Seas Initiative, and the fund as its key investment vehicle, are leading this charge.",

        "text": "At the beginning of A Gentleman in Moscow's episode, Alexander (Ewan McGregor) stands at the edge of the Metropol Hotel's roof. He looks like he's about to jump into the night. Those godforsaken communists are ruining everything! Right before he can make that fatal tumble, though, we go back in time -- from Alexander's 1,667th day at the hotel back to his 1,638th day. Let's see how he got to this low point during his stay at the Metropol.\n\nWe're back on the roof; now, it's daytime, and Alexander is happily stretching. Up atop the building, the Count meets Abram (Dermot Crowley), the roof's caretaker who takes a liking to Alexander. The pair share a sliver of honeycomb off Abram's beehive while fretting about the sounds of explosions going off in the distance. Outside, we learn, Russia has crumbled following the death of Lenin. But inside the Metropol Hotel, all is...well, strained, but still somewhat alright.\n\nAn older Nina (Leah Balmforth) visits Alexander at the hotel. The pair bond over some chess and more fiery arguments -- since Nina has aged up, she's developed her own opinions. The pair discuss whether or not Napoleon would've ever been able to conquer Europe. Sasha thinks that, yes, if he didn't have those weird maternal issues, he'd have been able to. But Nina believes that, in any circumstance, the people would've risen to take him down.\n\nAnna (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is still at the hotel after the pair's first encounter long ago, but she and Alexander haven't spoken to one another since the hookup. Alexander slips her notes across the hotel. She ignores his advances. At this point in her career, Anna is a big movie star -- she doesn't have time for a man who is trapped in a hotel holding cage.\n\nLater, the Count learns from Mishka (Fehinti Balogun) that his grandmother has passed away in England. No funeral was held. Distraught, Alexander starts to plan a party of his own at the Metropol, where he'll invite a handful of friends to one last opulent evening of celebration for the late Countess Rostov. He's the last Rostov remaining. It's Alexander's duty to send her off in style.\n\nEveryone warns Alexander against this party. It's far too gauche for Moscow's current environment, in which the rich are murdered at the will of the people, and Alexander's already on thin ice. Mishka is especially peeved when he receives an invitation to the party. It shouldn't be happening, he tells Alexander. But Alexander wants to rebuild Moscow as a place for people of all wealths. \"Rome wasn't built in a day,\" Mishka warns.\n\n\"No,\" Alexander agrees, \"but it was burnt down in one.\" Alexander has had it with the lesser classes taking over his nobility. That's enough! Let him eat cake.\n\nAt that very same bar some moments later, Alexander notices some room service being sent up to Anna's and takes a chance: He'll deliver the food and make another pass at Anna. Anna's longtime servant Olga (Anastasia Hille) is peeved to see Alexander and almost sends him away, but Anna tells her to leave them to it. Over some champagne, Alexander asks why Anna never called him to her room again. Anna's excuse? She was always around, but Alexander never came to see her. All he had to do was knock on her door. The two pounce on each other.\n\nThat'll be the last good news for Alexander and the terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day, because as soon as the Count returns to the real world, he learns some awful news. Not only have demonstrators torn up the Imperial Gardens of Russia, but the Metropol Hotel has also banned wine. WHAT?! Okay, well, not all wine. After Alexander orders a barolo, he's shocked to find the hotel only offers house red and white. The labels have all been torn off -- essentially, you get what you get.\n\nThis major update sets the tone for Alexander's party to send off his late grandmother. On top of the wine dilemma, Stalin is rumored to be visiting the hotel tonight in honor of Anna's big movie premiere. Communist party flags and big photos of Stalin are hung from every balcony in the Metropol. Even Nina is helping to hang the banners. This isn't exactly what Alexander had in mind for his celebration -- but c'est la vie. The party will go on.\n\nOr...will it? Only one guest -- Mishka -- shows up for Alexander's party. Everyone is too scared to be caught attending such a soiree when Stalin himself may be at the Metropol. Mishka tries to make Alexander understand this, but the Count simply can't. When Nina appears, defending Stalin and slamming Alexander for whining about the wine, the party really takes a turn for the worse. After both Mishka and Nina storm out on account of Alexander's bad behavior, all of the food is wasted. Alexander wants to make the case for building back Russia, but this is pretty foul behavior, and an example of why the country can't go back to what it was before.\n\nThe turnout really gets to Alexander, who storms up to the roof. Here we are, day 1,667, in the bleak middle of winter, where Alexander wants to end his life out of agony. Luckily, right as he's about to jump off, Abram invites him for some tea in his corner of the roof. Sweet Abram tells Alexander he's too young to waste his life -- there's still a lot of living to do.\n\nAlexander isn't the only one who's had his night ruined by the communists. Anna is wrecked after Stalin doesn't make an appearance at her movie -- he wasn't interested enough to show up. Bummer...I guess? Alexander and Anna drink away their disappointment and grab each other in the elevator. So, all in all: The night wasn't that bad. At least they have each other.",

The key issues remain, including difficulty in obtaining long-term visas, leaving foreign news bureaus understaffed; reporters being obstructed by police or other officials while on assignment, and harassment when reporting in Xinjiang and border regions, VOA reported.\n\nThe FCCC surveys over 155 correspondents every year, covering, Asia, Europe, Latin America and North America.\n\nIts latest report is based on 101 responses to that survey, which looked at working conditions for foreign media.\n\nAccording to the report, one of the main difficulties is securing visas. Around one-third of respondents said their bureaus remain understaffed because of difficulty in extending or successfully applying for new visas, reported VOA.\n\nMoreover, Chinese authorities have mostly issued short-term visas.\n\nEarlier in 2023, only one US outlet was able to get accreditation, according to the FCCC, adding that the Canadian media have had no resident reporters in China for four years.\n\nRespondents said that as pandemic restrictions eased, they have returned to uncertainty over what stories will result in surveillance or trips being cut short.\n\nFour out of five of those surveyed said that they experienced interference and harassment, and more than half reported being blocked from reporting or filming by police or other officials, according to VOA.\n\nAccording to the FCCC report, nearly all those reported from Xinjiang or Tibet highlighted that they experienced increased harassment.\n\nAdditionally, journalists who reported or tried to travel to other border regions in the country also reported harassment.\n\nAfter Xinjiang, the area with the most reported obstacles was the border with Russia, with 79 per cent of journalists trying to report from there experiencing difficulties.\n\nOne journalist at a European outlet described being followed by several vehicles during a reporting trip to a town, along the Russian border, the report stated.\n\n\"They did not interfere during any of our interviews, although they did reach out to at\n\nleast one interviewee afterwards. When we checked into our hotel, the hotel staff\n\nreferred to us as 'the journalists state security had warned them about' earlier,\" the reporter said. Meanwhile, similar experiences were reported by journalists who traveled to Inner Mongolia, VOA reported.\n\nThe FCCC stated that three cases of plainclothes individuals warned people not to speak with journalists or to follow news crews.\n\n\"Foreign journalists are, according to China's own regulations, free to report on a wide range of topics and speak to whomever they want,\" the FCCC said in its report.\n\nThe survey showed an increase in journalists being \"invited for tea,\" a tactic where Chinese officials invite foreign media to an informal meeting.\n\nDuring the meetings, journalists are asked about their coverage and while the FCCC says the exchanges are usually \"cordial,\" it notes they can be used as a form of intimidation.\n\nMoreover, 'surveillance' is another concern, with respondents seeing more sources declining interviews or requesting anonymity.\n\nNearly all those surveyed said that they believe they are targeted with digital surveillance through communication apps or that their homes or offices are bugged.\n\nMoreover, four of those surveyed said that officials referenced information that could have been known only if the authorities had access to private accounts or devices, reported VOA.\n\nAccording to the FCCC, the restrictions and harassment have prevented the media from reporting a more balanced and nuanced picture of life in China.\n\n\"The result is coverage of China that cannot fully capture its massively complex dynamics,\" the FCCC said in its report. \"Correspondents, restricted in where they can travel and with whom they can speak, no longer have the luxury of delving deeply into topics and painting a nuanced picture of the country. The result is coverage of China that is narrower in scope and less representative.\"\n\nOn the Press Freedom Index, China has a poor press freedom record, ranking 179 out of 180 countries, where one shows the best environment.\n\nMedia watchdog Reporters Without Borders, which compiles the index, said China is conducting a \"campaign of repression against journalism and the right to information worldwide.\" (ANI)",

        "text": "ABOARD THE USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT (AP) -- A U.S. carrier strike group led by the USS Theodore Roosevelt has held a three-day joint exercise with its allies Japan and South Korea as U.S. President Joe Biden met for talks with leaders from Japan and the Philippines at the White House. The dueling military and diplomatic maneuvers are meant to strengthen the partners' solidarity in the face of China's aggressive military actions in the region.\n\nA number of U.S. and South Korean guided missile destroyers and a Japanese warship joined the April 10-12 drill in the disputed East China Sea, where worries about China territorial claims are rising. The Associated Press was one of several news organizations allowed a front-row look at the drills.\n\nRear Adm. Christopher Alexander, commander of Carrier Strike Group Nine, said the three nations conducted undersea warfare exercises, maritime interdiction operations, search and rescue drills and work focused on communication and data sharing. He told journalists Thursday on the Roosevelt that these drills would help improve communication among the United States and its allies and \"better prepare us for a crisis in the region.\"\n\nF/A-18E Super Hornet combat jets took off from the carrier's flight deck, which also had anti-submarine MH-60R Seahawk helicopters. Journalists were flown more than an hour from Kadena Air Base, the hub of U.S. Pacific air power. Kadena is on Japan's southern island of Okinawa, which is home to about half of the 50,000 American troops stationed in Japan.\n\n\"It is a busy time; there is a lot going on in the world,\" Alexander said. \"The significance of this exercise is we have three like-minded countries, three like-minded navies that believe in peace, security and stability in the western Pacific.\"\n\nThe participation of Japan and South Korea was another sign of improving ties between the sometimes wary neighbors. The two U.S. allies' relationship has often been strained by the memory of Japan's half-century colonization of the Korean Peninsula. Washington has been pressing them to cooperate so the three partners can better deal with threats from China and North Korea.\n\nThis week's huge parliamentary election defeat of the governing party of South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, who has sought better relations with Japan, could constrain his Japan-friendly efforts, but experts believe ties will remain stable.\n\nThe latest naval exercise is part of Biden's work to deepen security and diplomatic engagement with Indo-Pacific nations. Biden invited Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos to the White House for their first trilateral talks Thursday, and has declared that the U.S. defense commitment to the Pacific allies is \"ironclad.\"\n\nTensions between China and the Philippines have risen over repeated clashes by the two nations' coast guard vessels in the disputed South China Sea. Chinese coast guard ships also regularly approach disputed Japanese-controlled East China Sea islands near Taiwan.\n\nBeijing has defended its operations in the South China Sea and blamed the United States for creating tensions. China's President Xi Jinping had a series of talks this week with senior officials from Vietnam, Russia and Taiwan.\n\nThe U.S.-Japan-South Korea naval exercises follow four-way drills held in the South China Sea, where Japan joined the United States, Australia and the Philippines. Participants carefully avoided mentioning China and said they were holding the exercises to safeguard a peaceful and stable Indo-Pacific.\n\nAn area of long-simmering disputes, the South China Sea serves a key sea lane for global trade. Concerned governments include Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Brunei and Taiwan.",

        "title": "Trump to host embattled Speaker Mike Johnson as House swirls in turmoil - The Daily Reporter - Greenfield Indiana",
        "text": "The two are planning a joint announcement on election integrity ahead of November, but the trip itself is significant for both. Johnson needs Trump to temper hard-line Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's threats to evict him from office. And Trump benefits from the imprimatur of official Washington dashing to Florida to embrace his comeback bid for the White House and his tangled election lies.\n\n\"It is the symbolism,\" said Charlie Sykes, a conservative commentator and frequent Trump critic.\n\n\"There was a time when the Speaker of the House of Representatives was a dominant figure in American politics,\" he said. \"Look where we are now, where he comes hat in hand to Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nHaving the House speaker and the presidential contender align for the campaign season is not in itself surprising or even unexpected, a typical arrangement as the party builds a coordinated effort of resources and proposals to present to voters in the fall.\n\nBut in the Trump era, the sojourns by Republican leaders to his private club in Palm Beach, Florida, have become defining moments, underscoring the lopsided partnership as the former president commandeers the party in sometimes humiliating displays of power.\n\nSuch was the case when Kevin McCarthy, then the House GOP leader, trekked to Mar-a-Lago after having been critical of the defeated president after the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol. A cheery photo was posted afterward, a sign of their mending relationship.\n\nJohnson proposed the idea of coming to Mar-a-Lago weeks before Greene filed her motion to vacate him from the speaker's office. The visit comes just days before the former president's criminal trial on hush money charges gets underway next week in New York City.\n\nThe trip shows the fragility of the speaker's grip on the gavel, just six months on the job since replacing the ousted McCarthy, but also his evolving grasp of the politics of the Trump era.\n\nJohnson of Louisiana understands he needs Trump's backing to conduct almost any business in the House -- including his next big priority, providing U.S. aid to Ukraine to fight Russia's invasion.\n\nThe speaker's own political livelihood depends on support -- or at least not opposition -- from the \"Make America Great Again\" Republicans who are aligned with Trump but creating much of the House dysfunction that has ground work to a halt.\n\nJohnson commands the narrowest majority in modern times and a single quip from the former president can derail legislation. He was once a Trump skeptic, but the two men now talk frequently, including earlier this week.\n\nEven still, Trump urged Republicans to \"kill\" a national security surveillance bill that Johnson had personally worked to pass, contributing to a sudden defeat that sent the House spiraling this week into crisis. It was expected to try again to pass the bill Friday before Johnson departs for Florida.\n\nIn a daring move, the speaker is working both sides to help Ukraine, talking directly to the White House on the national security package that is at risk of collapse with Trump's opposition. Greene is warning of a snap vote to oust Johnson from leadership if he allows any U.S. assistance to flow to the overseas ally.\n\n\"The funding of Ukraine must end,\" Greene said she told Johnson in a private meeting this week.\n\nOn the issue of election integrity, though, Johnson, who led one of the main legal challenges to the 2020 election won by Joe Biden, appears to be more aligned with Trump.\n\nTrump continues to insist the 2020 election was marred by fraud, even though no evidence has emerged in the last four years to support his claims and every state in the nation certified their results as valid.\n\nAs he runs to reclaim the White House, Trump has essentially taken over the Republican National Committee, turning the campaign apparatus toward his priorities. He supported Michael Whatley to lead the RNC, which created a new \"Election Integrity Division\" and says it is working to hire thousands of lawyers across the country.\n\nAt Friday's event they are expected to promote ideas to prevent noncitizens from voting, even though it's already a federal felony for a noncitizen to cast a ballot in a federal election. There's no evidence of significant numbers of immigrants violating that law by casting illegal ballots.\n\nSome liberal cities like San Francisco have begun to allow noncitizens to vote in a few local elections, leading Republicans to argue there need to be even more laws forbidding it in federal elections.\n\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said he was supportive of those proposals. \"How do you ensure that noncitizens are not voting? That's that's what this is all about.\"\n\nWith his majority shrinking due to early retirements and departures, Johnson is operating as a speaker in name only. But the more he depends on Democrats to provide the votes needed to pass substantial legislation, including last month's bills to keep the government from shutting down, the deeper trouble he courts from the MAGA Republicans.\n\nTrump could help Johnson by promoting the House's legislative priorities or, at least, not torpedoing them. But that seems increasingly uncertain as the presumed presidential nominee leads the GOP in a different direction on both domestic and foreign policy priorities.\n\nTired of the infighting and wary of another dragged-out brawl like the monthlong slugfest to replace McCarthy, few Republicans are backing Greene's effort to remove Johnson, for now.\n\n\"Marjorie's actions are horrific,\" said Rep. Max Miller, R-Ohio, a former Trump administration official. \"They are childish. They are petulant. They have no place here in this body.\"\n\nBut if Trump signals otherwise, that could all change.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker emeritus, said this week on \"The Axe Files\" podcast: \"The Republicans wanted Donald Trump for speaker. And they got him.\"\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press reporters Stephen Groves, Kevin Freking and Nicholas Riccardi contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Coalition nuclear plan flips back to SMRs after latest meeting with lobbyists",
        "text": "And then, in a single bound, it was back to small modular reactors. The federal Coalition's confused nuclear power policy has lurched from SMRs to large scale nuclear and back again to SMRs. It's as if the policy is decided by the nuclear lobbyist most recently consulted.\n\nCoalition leader Peter Dutton's latest thought bubble on nuclear, dutifully reported in The Australian newspaper last weekend, is that Australia should sign up to SMRs, and should be able to build the first of them by the middle of the 2030s - faster than even most of the technology's boosters admit is possible.\n\nDutton says the new plan will be fully sketched out before the federal Labor government's budget in early May - and according to The Australian this latest plan follows meetings last week with executives of Rolls Royce SMR and its Australian partner Penske.\n\nRenew Economy decided to check all this out with Rolls Royce SMR itself, and got some surprising answers.\n\n\"It wasn't a representative of ours (who met with Peter Dutton),\" a company spokeswoman said by email. \"I believe it was a potential partner of ours that met with Peter Dutton who spoke about RR SMR on our behalf.\"\n\nDutton and other Coalition boosters like to talk about SMRs in the present tense, and most mainstream media dutifully follow suit, as if they are already operating.\n\nThis is deception. A group of my friends chatting over coffee this week was stunned to hear that SMRs are not actually a thing, despite what they read in the press. A few smaller nuclear reactors exist, such as in China and Russia, but they are in no way modular, which is the supposed key selling point of this new technology.\n\n\"One of the biggest problems for SMRs is that they don't exist,\" Allison Macfarlane, director of the school of public policy and global affairs at the University of British Columbia and a former chair of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, told the Financial Times this week.\n\n\"We're still at the paper stage, the computer model stage. To get to demonstration models and then a full-scale model when you are ready to commercialise will take billions of dollars,\" she added.\n\nRolls Royce SMR is still at least two years away from obtaining a licence, and the spokesperson told Renew Economy this week that the company is hopeful that the first SMR can be completed \"in the early 2030s.\"\n\nHowever, Simon Bowen, the chair of Great British Nuclear, the government agency that is trying to lead the technology's revival and find ways to replace its existing ageing fleet, told the FT this week the first SMR won't likely be seen until the mid 2030s.\n\nThat time line is important, because it goes to the fantasy nature of the Coalition's nuclear policy. Is Dutton seriously suggesting that Australia, with no civil nuclear power industry, can match the UK on timing on their proprietary nuclear technology.\n\nAnd first-of-their-kind technologies are always considerably more expensive than those that follow. But more on the timing later, because that goes to the heart of what the Coalition is trying to do - not so much build nuclear, but to stop renewables in their tracks.\n\nBut it is impossible to think that Australia would commit to an SMR before it is built in its host country, with all the embedded infrastructure and know-how. And no country is going to commit to more SMRs until the first one is built, and can prove itself. Which straightaway pushes the Coalition timeline back into the 2040s.\n\nOn costs, Dutton is trying to convince everyone that nuclear - contrary to all available evidence - is low cost, which The Australian, unsurprisingly, reported as a matter of fact.\n\nThe Coalition's energy spokesman Ted O'Brien engages in some impressive verbal calisthenics by claiming that they might be expensive for investors, but are low cost for consumers.\n\nBut if new-build nuclear is to be low cost to consumers it will be the result, as it is in France, of massive government subsidies. And given the Coalition's horrified reaction to Labor's \"Made in Australia\" green manufacturing plan, they are definitely not in favour of government subsidies.\n\nThe Australian reported that the Rolls Royce SMR is priced at around $5 billion for a 470 MW facility, which appears an heroic assumption given it is less than one third of the price of the only SMR to actually obtain a licence to date, the NuScale project in the US that was cancelled last year because it was too expensive for consumers.\n\nRolls Royce SMR's own web page describes a study produced last year that claimed its technology could reduce wholesale prices in the UK by between three per cent and 13 per cent, depending on how many SMRs were rolled out.\n\nCuriously, the study - according to the detailed Rolls Royce summary of it - arrives at these numbers by comparing SMRs to the cost of peaking gas plants, the most expensive generation on the grid, and which - in reality - is rarely used. They are only switched on around 1 to 2 per cent of the time.\n\nThese peaking gas plants are not seen as the usual competitor to nuclear or SMRs, because nuclear is designed to be baseload, not the fast response and flexible capacity needed to fill in the gaps of a grid dominated by wind and solar.\n\nAnd, it should be noted, nuclear itself is highly dependent on fast-response capacity - peaking gas and pumped hydro - to make up for its own lack of flexibility.\n\nThe Rolls Royce spokesperson told Renew Economy that this analysis was conducted in the winter of 2022/23, when the energy crisis was at its worst, gas prices had soared, and energy consumers were being hit by huge bills.\n\nIt begs a question, which Rolls Royce didn't answer: If SMRs are only able to undercut peaking gas power plant prices by a small amount, what does that imply when those costs are spread across the whole day?\n\nThe spokesperson confirmed that Rolls Royce SMRs will indeed be focused on \"baseload\" power, and its SMRs are designed not to displace renewables, but replace \"the loss in low-carbon electricity ... caused by our ageing existing reactor fleet going offline in the years ahead.\"\n\nThe spokesperson said SMRs do have a degree of flexibility to load follow and respond \"when the wind doesn't blow and the sun doesn't shine,\" and can use its thermal output to produce hydrogen or process heat, which might be attractive in the northern hemisphere.\n\nBut they have little ability to ramp up to fill in gaps of wind and solar because, as the spokesperson told Renew Economy in their email: \"SMRs work most cost-effectively when 'always on'.\"\n\nAnd this is important because it goes to the heart of why the Coalition nuclear plan makes absolutely no sense and is more about destruction of one industry, rather than construction of another.\n\nAustralia is heading towards 82 per cent renewables by 2030, and even if it doesn't meet that deadline, it will be above 90 per cent by the mid 2030s, and likely close to 100 per cent.\n\nA fleet of \"always on\" nuclear power plants will struggle to find a role in that scenario, particularly as daytime demand will be almost entirely met by the anticipated ongoing boom in small-scale solar on the roofs of household and business consumers.\n\nBut the Coalition policy, and it makes no secret of this, is not about compatibility. O'Brien's own energy advisor admits that nuclear and renewables are effectively an \"either-or\" because the system is either going to be baseload or renewables and storage.\n\nAnd the Coalition's fundamental stand is that it refuses to believe that wind and solar can power a modern economy. \"The lights will go out,\" says Dutton, or \"your fridge goes off at home\" he added this week.\n\nWhich is why they are calling for a moratorium on the roll out of wind, solar, battery storage and transmission, and why they want coal-fired power stations to stay open until nuclear can arrive.\n\nAnd it's why their proxies in the mainstream and social media - and so-called think tanks and ginger groups backed by billionaires such as Gina Rinehart and Trevor St Baker - spend so much time demonising the technologies that are currently available, and which can do the job, such as solar, wind, battery storage and electric vehicles.\n\nDutton's rhetoric is also liberally splattered with outright falsehoods. A check of his media transcripts this week reveals a number of common false statements.\n\nThe first is the claim that Australia is the only OECD country not to have or want nuclear. Not true. Germany closed down the last of its nuclear generators a year ago, and Italy voted against the technology in a referendum a decade ago after shutting down the last of its reactors. A number of other EU countries are following suit.\n\nDutton also claims that the federal government is planning \"28,000 kms of new transmission lines by 2030.\" Again, not true. The Australian Energy Market Operator's Integrated System Plan models 10,000km by 2030 in its core step change plan. That's still a lot, but little more than one third of what Dutton claims.\n\nThe 28,000km number is a 2050 target, not 2030, and only in the scenario where Australia becomes a renewable energy superpower by exporting green hydrogen and other green products, most likely from vast wind and solar projects in the middle of the country that will need to link into the grids or production facilities.\n\nDutton says he wants to have a \"mature\" discussion about the energy mix. But that can't happen if his rhetoric is based around obvious lies.",

        "text": "VIENNA -- China supports the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in playing a constructive role in ensuring the safety and security of nuclear facilities after recent drone attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant (ZNPP), a Chinese envoy said on Thursday.\n\nLi Song, China's permanent representative to the IAEA, told a special meeting of the agency's 35-nation Board of Governors that the ZNPP faces high nuclear safety risks in the middle of the battlefield, warning that \"the impact of nuclear accidents transcends borders and there is no room for error.\"\n\nThe meeting was convened at the request of Russia and Ukraine to discuss the recent attacks on ZNPP, which occurred on Sunday and Tuesday. They were the first attacks since November 2022 to directly target the ZNPP, the largest nuclear power plant in Europe, according to the IAEA.\n\nQuoting a paper released by China last February on its position on the political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, Li said that China opposes armed attacks against nuclear power plants or other peaceful nuclear facilities and stresses the need to avoid man-made nuclear accidents.\n\nChina supports IAEA's efforts to promote the safety of Ukraine's nuclear facilities and supports the seven pillars and five principles proposed by IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi to ensure nuclear safety in Ukraine, Li said, adding that China has contributed to the agency's funding for its technical assistance project on nuclear safety and security in Ukraine.\n\nChina supports the IAEA in maintaining contact with all parties and playing a constructive role in ensuring the safety and security of nuclear facilities, Li said.\n\nThe Chinese envoy also called on relevant parties to exercise restraint, strictly abide by the Convention on Nuclear Safety and other relevant international laws, refrain from taking any action that endangers nuclear facilities, and create favorable conditions for the IAEA to perform its functions.\n\nNoting that the resolution of Ukraine's nuclear safety issue ultimately depends on the prospect of a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, Li called on the international community to continue promoting peace talks, encourage and support all efforts conducive to a peaceful settlement of the crisis, and fundamentally eliminate nuclear safety risks.\n\nChina will continue to uphold an objective and impartial position, actively promote peace and dialogue, commit itself to promoting ceasefire, and play a constructive role in promoting a political settlement of the Ukraine crisis, Li added.",

        "text": "THE sight of Muslims preparing for the Eid celebration, a significant ritual in Islam, is a captivating one. They eagerly shop for clothes, perfumes, and exchange gifts and sweets with loved ones. Bustling markets and lively streets transform night into day, heightening the anticipation for festivities.\n\nYet, our brothers and sisters in Palestine, the esteemed land of the prophets and the Night of Ascension of Prophet Muhammad to the heavens, deserve our solidarity. Imagine Palestinians in Gaza, preparing burial shrouds, bracing for potential killings by Israeli soldiers. Some children even inscribe their names on their bodies before sleep, unsure if they will awaken. The uncertainty of survival weighs heavily, a poignant reality of their daily existence.\n\nAfter six months of relentless Zionist aggression against Gaza in an unequal and oppressive war, the toll is staggering: more than 33,000 dead and 75,000 wounded, with a majority being women, children, and the elderly. Even doctors, journalists, and aid workers are not spared. The blockade exacerbates hunger and thirst, with vital aid supplies denied, and 70% of infrastructure lay in ruins. Amidst these unprecedented massacres and genocide, where do we find the United Nations Security Council, the International Court of Justice, and the United Nations? Where is the advocacy of human rights, swift and resolute when defending Ukraine against Russia? Does this imply Western blood holds greater value? Urgent answers are imperative.\n\nThe racism and double standards of the West are evident in Gaza. The recent murder of seven UN members of diverse nationalities by Israeli soldiers underscores this bias. While Western governments demand investigations and halt weapon supplies, the thousands killed in the past months are seemingly disregarded. As Israel's Defence Minister Yoav Gallant callously stated on April 8, it questions the humanity attributed to these victims. Hence, the crucial question must be directed towards Muslim leaders and communities.\n\nWhile a significant portion of Muslims have shown support through boycotts and protests, some self-proclaimed Muslims exhibit negligence and hesitation. Yet, this response falls short given the ongoing shedding of innocent blood in the holy land and the dire lack of necessities in Gaza. It's imperative for all to realise they are answerable to Allah, humanity, and history. While mourning is customary when a loved one passes, let's not forget our brethren in Gaza who face death every moment. Instead of frivolities such extravagant parties with singers and sports events, we should focus on supporting those in need and advocating for justice.\n\nDear brothers and sisters, let us ponder deeply. Islam instructs us to oppose oppressors and aid the oppressed, irrespective of their religion, colour, or gender. The Prophet Muhammad conveyed from Allah, the Most High: \"O My slaves, I have made oppression unlawful for Myself and have made it unlawful among you, so do not oppress one another\" (Sahih Muslim). Let us uphold this noble teaching in our actions and dealings with others.\n\nThis emphasises the unity of Muslims as one body; when one part suffers, the entire body feels the pain. Allah's Messenger likened believers to a single body: \"You see the believers, in terms of their mercy for one another and their love for one another and their kindness, similar to a single body so that if one part of the body is not well, the whole body shares insomnia (sleeplessness) and fever with it\" (Sahih al-Bukhari).\n\nLet us embody this unity and compassion in our actions towards each other. In this context, it is crucial to remind the world, especially the Jewish community, of history. Muslims extended welcome, protection, and refuge to Jews, opening their lands when they were expelled from Germany. While Greece, Italy, France, Switzerland, and Portugal imposed bans and persecution, Muslims provided sanctuary, highlighting the tradition of hospitality and compassion in Islam.\n\nHistorical records attest to Islam's justice, generosity, and solidarity. In 1492, Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II dispatched a fleet to evacuate Sephardic Jews, granting them Ottoman citizenship and religious freedom. They found safety and security in Turkey, Algeria, and other Islamic lands under Ottoman rule. Chief Rabbi Isaac Sarfati of Adrianople affirmed: \"Turkey is a country where nothing is lacking and where everything will be in order. If you wish, the way to the Holy Land through Turkey is open to you.\" This illustrates Islam's tradition of sanctuary and inclusivity. The question that arises is: Is this how you repay those who aided you in times of need, who shielded you from fear, and who rescued you from peril? Surely not, for Allah, the Almighty, decrees, \"Is the reward for good (anything) but good?\"\n\nThe atrocities unleashed by Israel today - massacres, genocide, starvation policies, displacement, and infrastructure destruction - are not just a trial for Gaza's people but also for international organisations, power holders, and influencers who champion justice and human rights yet remain passive. It's a moral test for every person with a conscience, especially Muslims, to alleviate the injustice against their brethren in Palestine. - April 12, 2024.\n\n* Youcef Bensala reads The Malaysian Insight.",
