        "text": "Kyiv at most fragile moment in more than two years of war, Western officials say\n\nRisk emerges of Ukraine forces collapse, Russian breakthrough, as US aid stalls\n\nRussia\u2019s missile attacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy system, the bombardment of its second-largest city and advances along the front are stoking worries that Kyiv\u2019s military effort is nearing breaking point.\n\nA dire shortage of ammunition and manpower along the 1,200km (930 mile) front and gaps in air defence show that Ukraine is at its most fragile moment in over two years of war, according to Western officials with knowledge of the situation.\n\nThe risk is a collapse of Ukrainian defences, an event that would give Kremlin an opening to make a major advance for the first time since the initial stages of the conflict, at least one official said.\n\nThe next few months will amount to Ukraine\u2019s toughest test, with a public growing exhausted of war, especially in the city of Kharkiv in the country\u2019s east, which has been particularly targeted.\n\nKrystyna Malieieva, who fled the city after Russia invaded and then returned, said the unpredictability of the attacks have struck fear into city residents, even if most don\u2019t believe the Kremlin can take a metropolis whose pre-war population was 1.5 million.\n\n\u201cThere is very depressive mood in Kharkiv now,\u201d Malieieva, the owner of a family centre who returned in 2023 after a year in Croatia and the UK, said in an interview. \u201cPeople started to return last year, new restaurants opened \u2013 and now I see people are fleeing again.\u201dKremlin says Ukraine peace talks without Russia \u2018make no sense\u2019\n\nRussian forces are benefiting from a widening gap in ammunition supplies, with Moscow set to secure 6 million shells this year with ramped-up production and supplies from North Korea and Iran, according to one official.\n\nHanging above it all is the stalled US$60 billion US aid package, a victim of infighting as House Republicans demand concessions on immigration from President Joe Biden. Should those funds not come through, there is no alternative for Ukraine at its darkest moment, the officials said.\n\nFar from being able to seize back occupied territory, which was last year\u2019s objective, Kyiv\u2019s forces are struggling to hold the line on Russia\u2019s advance. President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week that Russia may be able to mobilise as many as 300,000 new troops by June 1.\n\nCongress needs to act to approve the military aid and there is no way around that, a White House National Security Council spokesperson said.\n\nThe US doesn\u2019t see any signs of an imminent breakthrough by Russian forces, a US official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. But Ukraine\u2019s morale is low and the possibility of a collapse in its army can\u2019t be ruled out, another official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe destruction early Thursday of a thermal power plant some 45km south of Kyiv \u2013 the biggest producer in the region around the capital \u2013 drove home the country\u2019s vulnerability to missile strikes.\n\nZelensky called the military\u2019s lack of air defence \u201cthe biggest challenge\u201d in the hours after the attack.\n\nThe demise of the Trypilska was part of a nationwide missile and drone barrage that hit targets, including plants and gas-storage facilities, in five regions. European natural gas futures rose to their highest level in over two weeks, with benchmark futures jumped as much as 7.1 per cent.\n\nRussian forces have also unleashed their firepower all along the front line and made marginal gains since capturing the eastern city of Avdiivka in February.US general says Ukraine could be outgunned by Russia \u201810 to 1\u2019 in weeks\n\nKremlin troops are seeking to close in strategically key spots, such as the town of Chasiv Yar, west of Bakhmut in Ukraine\u2019s Donetsk region.\n\nAfter months of stalling, Zelensky and Ukrainian lawmakers have expedited contested legislation to bolster the ranks of fighting forces, approving a lower conscription age and tightened rules for the draft.\n\nA key worry is Kharkiv, which Russian forces tried and failed to seize in the opening campaign of the war.\n\nThe proximity of the city, to the Russian border makes it vulnerable to Russian shelling. Kremlin forces have pelted it with S-300 ballistic missiles and glide bombs, laying waste to swathes of residential areas and destroying nearly all local power-generating capacity.\n\nFor the first time since the invasion began, fewer than half of Ukrainians believe the country can recover all territory seized by Russia, a February survey by Kyiv-based Rating Group found. And while most of Ukrainians still believe in victory, they are increasingly questioning what it may entail.\n\nSo far there\u2019s been no mass exodus out of Kharkiv. Oleksandr Savchuk, the owner of a boutique publishing house, said the daily attacks won\u2019t force him out until Russia pulls artillery up to the city limits.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re here is also a form of resistance,\u201d he said.",

        "title": "In Latest Humiliation For Biden Admin, Russian Oil Is Trading Above The G7 Price Cap Everywhere - Russia News Now",
        "text": "Back in late 2022, when \"Western democracies\" bombastically unveiled theatrical sanctions against Putin, capping the price at which imports of Russian oil were permitted to no higher than $60, we said that this was one of the biggest farces in modern history, not only because it was an optical play that was made entirely for public consumption (as nobody in the west actually wanted to curtail Russian oil exports as the outcome would be a devastating surge of inflation as Biden now realizes), but also because there was no enforcement mechanism to cap the price at $60 and no more.\n\nWe were right, again, and today Bloomberg reports that \"Russian oil is trading far in excess of a Group of Seven price cap that's supposed to deprive Moscow of revenue for its war in Ukraine, suggesting significant non-compliance with the measure\", which anyone with half a working brain would have expected to happen, which of course excludes virtually all \"democratic\" bureaucrats who implemented this idiotic sanction (which only ended up making the Vitol oil traders billionaires).\n\nAccording to data from Argus Media, whose price assessments are followed by some G-7 nations involved in the cap, Russian flagship Urals grade oil is now selling for $75 a barrel at the point it leaves ports in the Baltic Sea and Black Sea. A Treasury official told Bloomberg that US officials are tracking the price increase, which they attribute to broader geopolitical dynamics, as the alternative - admitting they are idiots, would be a bit too introspective.\n\nAs a reminder, the Russian embaro cap requires that any western company involved in transporting Russian oil receives a so-called attestation, a document vouching that the cargo cost $60-a barrel or less. If it doesn't, they're not allowed to provide their services. The fact that Argus's prices are so far above that level creates what Bloomberg called a \"dissonance\", but what we would call, a giant slap on the face of the Biden administration which nobody takes seriously any more.\n\nWhile Urals has been above $60 almost all year, this month's surge to well above $70 will stretch the credibility of those attestations for traders wanting to keep using western services. Not like anyone actually thought those attestations had any credibility to begin with since the governments enforcing them were so clearly interested in having everyone ignore them.\n\nBloomberg data showed that in March, 23% of the nation's crude oil shipments had insurance against spills and collisions provided by members of the International Group of P&I Clubs. That means traders would have vouched that the cargoes cost well below where Argus assessed the Urals price to be, which was clearly not the case, and means that at least a quarter of Russian oil shippers are fabricating data. A smaller proportion moved on Greek tankers, all of which had cover from IG clubs, also requiring attestation.\n\nHilariously, the idiots in the Biden admin told Bloomberg that the cap is still having its intended effect, reducing the amount of money the Kremlin receives from oil sales by forcing the commodity to either be sold under the cap via western services, or through Russia's shadow fleet. Which, of course, is absolutely not the case and Putin is currently rolling in the cash from selling oil to the same European nations that are supplying Ukraine with their most modern weapons which Putin then handily blows up and reverse engineers. The US plans to continue the enforcement of the cap by sanctioning vessels operating in the shadow fleet, but will not do so in response to any specific market moves, the official said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, and for the reason that it would be extremely embarrassing if his name were to become public.\n\nA European Commission spokesperson said the bloc is aware of the risk of the price cap being dodged, and is committed to steps that deprive Russia of revenue while simultaneously \"supporting global energy market stability.\" It's also constantly reviewing existing measures to enforce the cap and prevent its violation or circumvention, the spokesperson said, adding that such measures require unanimity among member states. In other words, Europe knew from day one that the Russian oil embargo was not going to work, and now, a year and a half later, is blame the lack of \"unity\" for this farce.\n\nThe bloc's most recent sanctions package was aimed at tighten the cap's enforcement, the spokesperson said; clearly the package did not achieve the \"desired outcome.\"\n\nOf course, it's not just Russia that is rolling in dough: by the time Urals cargoes get to India, the grade is trading at $88 a barrel -- just $3.80 below than the global benchmark for physical cargoes, Dated Brent, Argus data show. When the nation's ESPO crude leaves the port of Kozmino in eastern Russia, it is at $84 a barrel. It hasn't been close to the price cap for about a year.\n\nBloomberg concludes that since last October, \"the US Treasury has shown it's prepared to punish companies for breaches of the price cap that happened in the past\" however, given its desire to avoid any actions that disrupt the flow of crude -- and risk higher prices -- the rally in headline Brent futures to around $90 a barrel may temper any push to do so at this time.",

        "text": "UKRAINE - Ukraine needs military aid and air defense systems in the face of Russia's intensifying attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, as he criticised his country's allies for engaging in \"lengthy discussions\" and \"turning a blind eye\".\n\nThe Russian military launched attacks on five regions across Ukraine, killing at least seven people and damaging infrastructure including substations and power generation facilities, Ukrainian officials said yesterday.\n\nZelenskyy said Russia fired more than 40 missiles and about 40 attack drones overnight, many targeting energy infrastructure. The attacks show how \"critical\" air defence has become for Ukraine, he posted on X, adding that the Russian missiles and Iranian-designed one-way drones must not be allowed to hit Ukraine.\n\nIn southern Odesa, Governor Oleh Kiper said on his Telegram channel last Wednesday night that Russian missile strikes killed four people, including a 10-year-old girl, and left several others in critical condition.\n\nThe region's air defences shot down seven Iranian-designed attack drones of the Russian military near energy infrastructure, which was not damaged, Kiper said yesterday morning.\n\nIn northeastern Kharkiv, two women and a 14-year-old girl were killed after a missile strike last Wednesday afternoon, Governor Oleg Sinegubov said on Telegram, also posting photos of rescuers clearing up rubble.\n\nHe reported multiple other attacks across Kharkiv through yesterday morning, including a drone attack that injured one person, and a missile fired from a Russian S-300 system that targeted \"energy infrastructure\".\n\nKharkiv was targeted with more than 10 missiles, leaving more than 200,000 subscribers without power.\n\nKharkiv, the capital of the region of the same name, lies just 30km (19 miles) from the border with Russia and has come under frequent bombardment since Moscow launched its invasion in February 2022.\n\nAttacks in the capital Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia and Lviv also targeted infrastructure, but left no casualties, according to local authorities.\n\nZelenskyy said that \"if Russian missiles and 'Shahed' drones continue to strike not only Ukraine but also the resolve of our allies, this will amount to a global license for terror\".\n\nThe president travelled to Lithuania to participate in a regional security summit yesterday, saying that \"Russian evil is a threat not only to Ukraine, but to every nation bordering Russia and to everyone who values international law\".\n\nUkraine signed a 10-year bilateral security deal with Latvia at the meeting. \"It envisages Latvia's annual military support for Ukraine at 0.25% of GDP,\" Zelenskyy posted on X.\n\nOn Wednesday, United States President Joe Biden urged the US House of Representatives to vote immediately on a $60billion Ukraine aid bill, which has been stuck in the House after clearing the Senate.\n\n\"There's overwhelming support for Ukraine among the majority of Democrats and Republicans. There should be a vote now,\" Biden told reporters.\n\nUkraine's parliament passed a bill yesterday to overhaul its army mobilisation rules as it tries to generate fresh manpower to rotate its troops.\n\nThe measure, which must be signed by Zelenskyy before it becomes law, would oblige men between 18 and 60 years to update their personal data with the military authorities, allowing draft offices to see more easily who can be called up in any region.\n\nThe bill also does not set any time limit for wartime military service, meaning that soldiers who have been fighting since the beginning of the invasion will have no dembilisation date and a chance to return home. The final, amended text of the contentious measures was still to be published on the parliament's website.\n\nUkraine's General Yuriy Sodol told parliament that Russian forces outnumber Ukrainian troops seven to 10 times in eastern regions.\n\n\"We lack manpower,\" said Sodol, who is commanding soldiers in the regions of Kharkiv, Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe top general for US forces in Europe, General Christopher Cavoli, told Congress last Wednesday that Ukraine will be outgunned 10 to one by Russia within a matter of weeks if Washington does not send more ammunition and weapons soon.

But now, increasingly concerning, is the potential for a coordinated attack here in the homeland, akin to the ISIS-K attack we saw at the Russia Concert Hall a couple of weeks ago.\"\n\nOn March 22, Moscow's Crocus City concert hall was attacked by terrorists, leaving 137 people dead and over 180 wounded. The gunmen who conducted the attack were identified by Russian media as Tajik nationals. After walking in with automatic weapons, the terrorists indiscriminately opened fire on the 6,200-seat venue.\n\nThe Islamic State's affiliate in Afghanistan, known as ISIS-K, claimed responsibility for the brutal attack.\n\nWray told members of the Congressional subcommittee that he would be \"hard-pressed\" to think of a time when so many threats to public safety and national security were all elevated at once, adding that it was the case as he sat before them.\n\n\"This is by no means a time to let up or dial back,\" he said. \"This is a time when we need your support the most. We need all the tools, all the people, and all the resources required to tackle these threats and keep Americans safe.\"\n\nOne of the tools is Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which some GOP lawmakers say does not go far enough to safeguard Americans' data. In fact, House Speaker Mike Johnson backed a bill to renew the controversial tool set to expire April 19, but over a dozen House GOP privacy hawks blocked the effort.\n\nWray told the committee the most indispensable tool Congress could give the FBI to fight foreign adversaries was the reauthorization of Section 702.\n\n\"It is critical in securing our nation, and we are in crunch time with our 702 authorities set to expire next week,\" Wray said. \"So, let me be clear: Failure to reauthorize 702 or gutting it with some new kind of warrant requirement would be dangerous, and put Americans lives at risk.\"\n\nAccording to the FBI director, Section 702 is crucial to identifying terrorists in the U.S. who are working with foreign terrorist organizations who publicly call for attacks on the country.\n\nThe tool helps the FBI find who the terrorists are working with to allow the FBI to stop them before they kill Americans, Wray said.\n\nHe also said Section 702 is crucial as China and Iran target Americans, the latter of which is known for kidnappings and assassinations.\n\nThe tool also allows the FBI to fend off cyber threats, as well as threats to electricity, water and medical facilities.\n\nWray said if Congress allows Section 702 to lapse, which it is set to do next week, it will \"massively increase the risk of missing crucial intelligence during a time of heightened national security threats across a whole multiple of fronts.\"\n\n\"Now is not the time for us to hang up our gloves, to take away tools we need to punch back. And failing to reauthorize 702 or gutting it with some kind of warrant requirement would be dangerous and put American lives at risk,\" he said. \"I think if FISA were to expire, it adds one more challenge to our ability to secure us from foreign threats, including border-related threats.\"\n\n\"This is not a time for panic; it is a time for heightened vigilance,\" Wray added.\n\nAmong the GOP lawmakers who blocked the bill were: House Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good, R-Va.; Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C.; Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.; Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La.; Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas; and Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., among others.\n\nOne GOP lawmaker compared the amendment's effects to forcing a police officer to seek a warrant before querying a license plate in their database.\n\nThey explained that if a suspected terrorist overseas is communicating with a U.S. citizen at home, a Section 702 search would already pick up their specific communications with that U.S. citizen.\n\nThe amendment would force authorities to seek a warrant before seeing the contents of that communication, which critics have warned could waste valuable time in the event of a serious threat.",

        "title": "Ukraine fatigue: Kiev and the West are tiring of war and each other",
        "text": "The idea of some form of compromise solution to Kiev-Moscow conflict is creeping up on foreign hawks and on more and more locals\n\nWhat a small band of objective-though-long-disparaged observers in the West have long warned about is now happening: Ukraine and the West are losing their war against Russia. The strategy of using Ukraine to either isolate and slowly suffocate Russia or to defeat and degrade it in a proxy war is coming to its predictable catastrophic end.\n\nThis reality is now being acknowledged even by key media and high officials that used to be uncompromising about pursuing the extremely ill-advised aim of military victory over Russia. A Washington Post article has explained that with \"no way out of a worsening war,\" Ukrainian President Zelensky's options \"look bad or worse.\" NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg has discovered the option of ending wars by concessions - Ukraine's concessions, that is. The sturdy old hardliner Edward Luttwak warns of a \"catastrophic defeat\" - for the West and Ukraine. True, Luttwak is still spreading desperate illusions about a direct NATO deployment to avert the worst. In reality, it would, of course, only make things much, much worse again, as in World War III worse. But his fear, not to say panic, is palpable.\n\nThe fast-approaching outcome will be a disaster for Ukraine, even if Moscow should be generous regarding the terms of a postwar settlement (not a given, after the costs that Russia has incurred). Ukraine has already been ruined in terms of its demography, territory, economy, and, last but not least, political future. The damage incurred cannot simply be undone and will have long-lasting consequences.\n\nFor the West, this war will also mark a dismal turning point, in four main ways that can only be sketched here:\n\nFirst, the US will have to absorb its worst defeat since Vietnam. Arguably, this latest fiasco is even worse because, even during the Vietnam War, America did not try to attack Russia (then, of course, leading the Soviet Union) as head-on as it does now. Washington's most over-confident attempt ever to take Moscow off the \"grand chessboard\" once and for all has backfired perfectly. In general, that will diminish America's capacity to impress and cajole globally. In particular, the goal of preventing the rise of regional hegemons in Eurasia, the holy grail of US geopolitics, is even farther out of reach than before. The \"unipolar\" moment and its illusions were passing anyhow, but the US leadership has added a textbook illustration of the West's limits.\n\nSecond, the EU and its individual members - especially myopic warmongers such as Germany, Poland, and France - are far worse off again: Their foolish abandoning of geopolitically imperative caution and balancing (remember: location, location, location) will cost them dearly.\n\nThird, in their own, different ways, cases such as Britain (not even an EU member anymore) and the Baltics (very exposed and very bellicose, a shortsighted combination) are in a class of their own: damage there will be galore. Damage control? The options are paltry.\n\nAnd, finally, there is, of course, NATO: Over-extended, self-depleted, and having gratuitously exposed itself as much weaker than it would like to seem. Its defeat by Russia in Ukraine will trigger centrifugal tendencies and blame games. Not to speak of the special potential for tension between the US and its clients/vassals in Europe, especially if Donald Trump wins the presidency again, as is likely. And, by the way, he can only thank NATO for proving his point about what a dubious proposition it has become. If you believe that having added more territory on the map (Sweden and Finland) was a \"win,\" just remember what has happened to the mistaken celebrations of Ukraine's territorial advances in 2022. Territory may be a price; it is not a reliable indicator of strength.\n\nYet what about Ukrainians? They have been used as pawns by their Western friends from hell. They are still living under a regime that has just decided to mobilize even more of them for a hopeless meatgrinder, while Zelensky is admitting that Ukraine is on the verge of defeat.\n\nSome Western media are still telling a simplistic and false story about Ukrainians' unflagging and united will to hold out for victory, as if every single one owed the West to play a Marvel hero to the bitter end. But in reality Ukraine is a normal, if badly misled country. Many of its citizens have long shown what they really think about dying for a toxic combination of Western geopolitics and the narcissism of a megalomanic comedian: by evading the draft, either by hiding in Ukraine or fleeing abroad. In addition, a recent poll shows that almost 54 percent of Ukrainians find the motives of the draft dodgers at least understandable. Kiev's push for increased mobilization will not go smoothly.\n\nBut there is more evidence of the fact that Ukraine's society is not united behind a Kamikaze strategy of \"no compromise.\" Indeed, under the title \"The Line of Compromise,\" Strana.ua, one of Ukraine's most important and popular news sites, has just published a long, detailed article about three recent and methodologically sound polls.\n\nThey all bear on Ukrainians' evolving attitudes to the war and in particular the question of seeking a compromise peace. In addition, Strana offers a rich sample of comments by Ukrainian sociologists and political scientists. It is no exaggeration to say that the mere appearance of this article is a sign that the times are changing: Under the subtitle \"How and why attitudes to the war differ in the East and the West of Ukraine,\" it even highlights \"substantial\" regional differences and, really, suppressed divisions. If you know anything about the extreme political - even historical - sensitivity of such divergences in Ukraine, then you will agree that this framing alone is a small sensation.\n\nBut that is not all. The article, in effect, dwells on ending the war by concessions - because that is what any compromise necessarily will take. Readers learn, for instance, that, according to the 'Reiting' agency polling on commission of Ukraine's Veterans' Affairs Ministry, in Ukraine's West, farthest removed from the current front lines, 50% of poll respondents are against any compromise, while no less than 42% are in favor of compromise solutions as long as other countries (other than Ukraine and Russia, that is) are involved in finding them. For a region that, traditionally, has been the center of Ukrainian nationalism, that is, actually, a remarkably high share of those siding with compromise.\n\nIf you move east and south over the map, the compromise faction gets stronger. In the East, the proportions are almost exactly reversed: 41% against compromise and 51% in favor. In the South, it's a perfect tie: 47% for both sides.\n\nOn the whole, Ukrainian sociologists are finding a \"gradual increase\" of those supporting a \"compromise peace\" in \"one form or the other.\" Even if, as one researcher plausibly cautions, this increase displays different rates in different regions, it still adds up to the national trend. One of its causes is \"disappointment,\" the loss of faith in victory, as the political scientist Ruslan Bortnik observes. In other words, the Zelensky regime is losing the information war on the home front. Notwithstanding its mix of censorship and showmanship.\n\nThe compromises imagined by Ukrainians include all conceivable solutions that do not foresee a return to the 1991 borders. In other words, there are ever more Ukrainians who are ready to trade territory for peace. How much territory, that is, of course, a different question. But it is clear that the maximalist and counter-productive aim of \"getting everything back,\" the all-or-nothing delusion, imposed for so long on Ukrainian society, is losing its grip.\n\nThe agency Socis, for instance, counts a total of almost 45% of respondents ready for compromise, while only 33% want to continue the war until the 1991 borders are re-established. But there are also 11% who still favor fighting on until all territories lost after February 2022 are recovered. That, as well, is now an unrealistic aim. It may have been closer to reality when Kiev dismissed an almost finished peace deal in the spring of 2022, on awful Western advice. That ship has sailed.\n\nPolling results, it is important to note, do not all point in the same direction. The KMIS agency has produced results that show 58% of respondents who want to continue the war \"under any circumstances\" and only 32% who would prefer a \"freeze,\" if Western security guarantees are given. Such a freeze, while a favorite pipedream of some Western commentators, is unlikely to be an option now, if it ever was. Why should Moscow agree? But that is less relevant here than the fact that KMIS, for one, seems to have found a massive bedrock of pro-war sentiment.\n\nAnd yet, even here, the picture is more complicated once we look closer. For one thing, the KMIS poll is comparatively old, conducted in November and December of last year. Given how quickly things have been developing on the battlefield since then - the key town and fortress of Avdeevka, for instance, finally fell only in February 2024 - that makes its data very dated.\n\nKMIS also had interesting comments to offer: The agency notes that respondents' proximity to the front lines plays an \"important role\" in shaping their opinions about the war. In other words, when the fighting gets close enough to hear the artillery boom, it concentrates the mind on finding a way to end it, even by concessions. As one Ukrainian sociologist has put it, \"in the East and South ... one of people's main concerns is that the war must not reach their own home, their own home town.\"\n\nIn addition, the executive director of KMIS has observed that the number of compromise advocates also grows when Western aid declines.\n\nIt remains difficult to draw robust conclusions from these trends, for several reasons: First, as some Ukrainian observers point out, the number of compromise supporters may be even higher - personally, I am sure it is - because the Zelensky regime has stigmatized any appeal to diplomacy and negotiations as \"treason\" for so long. Many Ukrainians are virtually certain to be afraid to speak their mind on this issue.\n\nSecond, what exactly the compromise camp understands by compromise is bound to be diverse. This camp may still include quite a few citizens who harbor illusions about what kind of compromise is available at this point.\n\nThird, the current regime - which is de-facto authoritarian - is not answerable to society, at least not in a way that would make it easy to predict how shifts in the national mood translate into regime policies, or not.\n\nAnd yet: There is no doubt that there is a groundswell in favor of ending the war even at the cost of concessions. Add the clear evidence of Western Ukraine fatigue - even a growing readiness to cut Ukraine loose - and the facts that the Russian military is creating on the ground, and it becomes hard to see how this basal shift in the Ukrainian mood could not become an important factor of Ukrainian - and international - politics.",

        "text": "A high-ranking source in Moscow has commented on the Ukrainian leader's plans\n\nUkraine's previous attempt at beating Russia on the battlefield has been a total disaster and Kiev should not expect anything different the next time, a highly positioned official at the Russian Ministry of Defense told reporters on Thursday.\n\nIn an exclusive interview published by German newspaper Bild earlier this week, Zelensky revealed that Ukraine has \"a plan for a counteroffensive\" but would need more weapons and supplies from its Western backers.\n\n\"I would remind you that the implementation of the previous counteroffensive plan in 2023, which Commander-in-Chief Zelensky delicately dubbed 'not successful', resulted in the death and serious injury of more than 166,000 members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the loss of 789 tanks, 2,400 other armored vehicles and 132 aircraft,\" the MOD official said.\n\nWith Ukrainians unwilling to volunteer for the cause of \"Zelensky's madness,\" Kiev has updated its mobilization rules to recruit \"new cannon fodder,\" the official added.\n\nHowever, the Ukrainian leader apparently expects the West to arm and equip hundreds of thousands of newly mobilized troops, as Ukraine itself has long run out of weapons, equipment and even ammunition, the official pointed out. Meanwhile, the West's own cupboard is bare and the US and its allies are already \"stripping their own troops naked\" to supply Ukraine.\n\nThanks to such an approach to military planning, \"there is no doubt that the implementation of Zelensky's new plan for a counter-offensive will end in complete disaster for Ukraine, the final defeat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and the beginning of the path to peace on Russian terms,\" the official said.\n\nNATO members began arming Ukraine even before the conflict with Russia escalated in February 2022, starting with anti-tank missiles and later sending Soviet-made tanks, artillery and fighter jets. When Kiev began running out of those as well, the US and its allies sent their own guns, armored fighting vehicles and even main battle tanks such as the Leopard 2 and Abrams. All along, however, they have insisted that this does not make them a party to the conflict.\n\nAmerican and British generals helped plan Ukraine's grand counteroffensive last summer, believing that Western-made weapons would enable Kiev's troops to punch through Russian defenses. \"Nothing went as planned,\" according to a Washington Post analysis of the operation, published in December. After just four days, the Ukrainian command abandoned the Western strategy and tried using its own tactics, to just as little effect.\n\nZelensky has maintained that he can't negotiate with Russia as long as President Vladimir Putin remains in power and won't accept any settlement that does not include the full restoration of Ukraine's pre-2014 borders.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly vowed that all of the objectives of its military operation will be achieved, including the full demilitarization and \"denazification\" of Ukraine and ensuring it never joins a military alliance hostile to Russia.",

        "text": "FBI Director Christopher Wray told the House Appropriations subcommittee on Thursday that there is an increasing concern of a potential coordinated attack in the U.S., similar to the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) attack last month at a concert hall in Russia.\n\nWray, who spoke before lawmakers to discuss the FY25 budget, said his agency needed additional funding to protect Americans from terrorism, adding that there has been a heightened risk of violence in the U.S. since Hamas-led terrorists invaded Israel on Oct. 7, 2024.\n\n\"Since then, we've seen a rogue's gallery of foreign terrorist organizations call for attacks against Americans and our allies,\" Wray said. \"Given those calls for action, our most immediate concern has been that individuals or small groups will draw twisted inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks here at home. But now, increasingly concerning, is the potential for a coordinated attack here in the homeland, akin to the ISIS-K attack we saw at the Russia Concert Hall a couple of weeks ago.\"\n\nOn March 22, Moscow's Crocus City concert hall was attacked by terrorists, leaving 137 people dead and over 180 wounded.

        "title": "FBI Director Christopher Wray cites increased foreign threats in FISA reauthorization plea: 'Rogue's gallery'",
        "text": "FBI Director Christopher Wray told the House Appropriations subcommittee on Thursday, April 11, 2024, that there is an increased risk of terrorist attacks on U.S. soil.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray told the House Appropriations subcommittee on Thursday that there is an increasing concern of a potential coordinated attack in the U.S., similar to the Islamic State in Khorasan Province (ISIS-K) attack last month at a concert hall in Russia.\n\nWray, who spoke before lawmakers to discuss the FY25 budget, said his agency needed additional funding to protect Americans from terrorism, adding that there has been a heightened risk of violence in the U.S. since Hamas-led terrorists invaded Israel on Oct. 7, 2024.\n\n\"Since then, we've seen a rogue's gallery of foreign terrorist organizations call for attacks against Americans and our allies,\" Wray said. \"Given those calls for action, our most immediate concern has been that individuals or small groups will draw twisted inspiration from the events in the Middle East to carry out attacks here at home. But now, increasingly concerning, is the potential for a coordinated attack here in the homeland, akin to the ISIS-K attack we saw at the Russia Concert Hall a couple of weeks ago.\"\n\nOn March 22, Moscow's Crocus City concert hall was attacked by terrorists, leaving 137 people dead and over 180 wounded. The gunmen who conducted the attack were identified by Russian media as Tajik nationals. After walking in with automatic weapons, the terrorists indiscriminately opened fire on the 6,200-seat venue.\n\nThe Islamic State's affiliate in Afghanistan, known as ISIS-K, claimed responsibility for the brutal attack.\n\nWray told members of the Congressional subcommittee that he would be \"hard-pressed\" to think of a time when so many threats to public safety and national security were all elevated at once, adding that it was the case as he sat before them.\n\n\"This is by no means a time to let up or dial back,\" he said. \"This is a time when we need your support the most. We need all the tools, all the people, and all the resources required to tackle these threats and keep Americans safe.\"\n\nFBI DIRECTOR WARNS OF 'ELEVATED' PUBLIC, NATIONAL SAFETY; PUSHES FOR INCREASED FUNDING\n\nOne of the tools is Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which some GOP lawmakers say does not go far enough to safeguard Americans' data. In fact, House Speaker Mike Johnson backed a bill to renew the controversial tool set to expire April 19, but over a dozen House GOP privacy hawks blocked the effort.\n\nWray told the committee the most indispensable tool Congress could give the FBI to fight foreign adversaries was the reauthorization of Section 702.\n\n\"It is critical in securing our nation, and we are in crunch time with our 702 authorities set to expire next week,\" Wray said. \"So, let me be clear: Failure to reauthorize 702 or gutting it with some new kind of warrant requirement would be dangerous, and put Americans lives at risk.\"\n\nHOUSE BRACES FOR BATTLE OVER RENEWING CONTROVERSIAL FISA SURVEILLANCE TOOL\n\nAccording to the FBI director, Section 702 is crucial to identifying terrorists in the U.S. who are working with foreign terrorist organizations who publicly call for attacks on the country.\n\nThe tool helps the FBI find who the terrorists are working with to allow the FBI to stop them before they kill Americans, Wray said.\n\nHe also said Section 702 is crucial as China and Iran target Americans, the latter of which is known for kidnappings and assassinations.\n\nThe tool also allows the FBI to fend off cyber threats, as well as threats to electricity, water and medical facilities.\n\nWray said if Congress allows Section 702 to lapse, which it is set to do next week, it will \"massively increase the risk of missing crucial intelligence during a time of heightened national security threats across a whole multiple of fronts.\"\n\nFBI DIRECTOR SAYS CHINESE HACKERS ARE 'POISED TO ATTACK' AS INFILTRATIONS REACH 'FEVER PITCH'\n\n\"Now is not the time for us to hang up our gloves, to take away tools we need to punch back. And failing to reauthorize 702 or gutting it with some kind of warrant requirement would be dangerous and put American lives at risk,\" he said. \"I think if FISA were to expire, it adds one more challenge to our ability to secure us from foreign threats, including border-related threats.\"\n\n\"This is not a time for panic; it is a time for heightened vigilance,\" Wray added.\n\nAmong the GOP lawmakers who blocked the bill were: House Freedom Caucus Chair Bob Good, R-Va.; Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C.; Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.; Rep. Clay Higgins, R-La.; Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas; and Rep. Matt Rosendale, R-Mont., among others.\n\nThe fight has put Johnson in a difficult spot between the House Judiciary Committee and its allies, and the U.S. intelligence community and national security hawks in Congress. The former have cast Section 702 as a tool of exploitation and privacy infringement, while the latter have maintained it's a narrowly-focused tool critical to preventing terror attacks.\n\nSection 702 is a provision that allows the federal government to conduct warrant-less surveillance of a foreign national outside the U.S. if they're suspected of ties to terrorism -- even if the person on the other end of the communications is an American citizen.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee backed an amendment that would force U.S. officials to seek a warrant before querying communications made by an American, which national security-minded Republicans have largely opposed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOne GOP lawmaker compared the amendment's effects to forcing a police officer to seek a warrant before querying a license plate in their database.\n\nThey explained that if a suspected terrorist overseas is communicating with a U.S. citizen at home, a Section 702 search would already pick up their specific communications with that U.S. citizen.\n\nThe amendment would force authorities to seek a warrant before seeing the contents of that communication, which critics have warned could waste valuable time in the event of a serious threat.",

        "title": "Ukraine fatigue: Kiev and the West are tiring of war and each other",
        "text": "The idea of some form of compromise solution to Kiev-Moscow conflict is creeping up on foreign hawks and on more and more locals\n\nWhat a small band of objective-though-long-disparaged observers in the West have long warned about is now happening: Ukraine and the West are losing their war against Russia. The strategy of using Ukraine to either isolate and slowly suffocate Russia or to defeat and degrade it in a proxy war is coming to its predictable catastrophic end.\n\nThis reality is now being acknowledged even by key media and high officials that used to be uncompromising about pursuing the extremely ill-advised aim of military victory over Russia. A Washington Post article has explained that with \"no way out of a worsening war,\" Ukrainian President Zelensky's options \"look bad or worse.\" NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg has discovered the option of ending wars by concessions - Ukraine's concessions, that is. The sturdy old hardliner Edward Luttwak warns of a \"catastrophic defeat\" - for the West and Ukraine. True, Luttwak is still spreading desperate illusions about a direct NATO deployment to avert the worst. In reality, it would, of course, only make things much, much worse again, as in World War III worse. But his fear, not to say panic, is palpable.\n\nThe fast-approaching outcome will be a disaster for Ukraine, even if Moscow should be generous regarding the terms of a postwar settlement (not a given, after the costs that Russia has incurred). Ukraine has already been ruined in terms of its demography, territory, economy, and, last but not least, political future. The damage incurred cannot simply be undone and will have long-lasting consequences.\n\nFor the West, this war will also mark a dismal turning point, in four main ways that can only be sketched here:\n\nFirst, the US will have to absorb its worst defeat since Vietnam. Arguably, this latest fiasco is even worse because, even during the Vietnam War, America did not try to attack Russia (then, of course, leading the Soviet Union) as head-on as it does now. Washington's most over-confident attempt ever to take Moscow off the \"grand chessboard\" once and for all has backfired perfectly. In general, that will diminish America's capacity to impress and cajole globally. In particular, the goal of preventing the rise of regional hegemons in Eurasia, the holy grail of US geopolitics, is even farther out of reach than before. The \"unipolar\" moment and its illusions were passing anyhow, but the US leadership has added a textbook illustration of the West's limits.\n\nSecond, the EU and its individual members - especially myopic warmongers such as Germany, Poland, and France - are far worse off again: Their foolish abandoning of geopolitically imperative caution and balancing (remember: location, location, location) will cost them dearly.\n\nThird, in their own, different ways, cases such as Britain (not even an EU member anymore) and the Baltics (very exposed and very bellicose, a shortsighted combination) are in a class of their own: damage there will be galore. Damage control? The options are paltry.\n\nAnd, finally, there is, of course, NATO: Over-extended, self-depleted, and having gratuitously exposed itself as much weaker than it would like to seem. Its defeat by Russia in Ukraine will trigger centrifugal tendencies and blame games. Not to speak of the special potential for tension between the US and its clients/vassals in Europe, especially if Donald Trump wins the presidency again, as is likely. And, by the way, he can only thank NATO for proving his point about what a dubious proposition it has become. If you believe that having added more territory on the map (Sweden and Finland) was a \"win,\" just remember what has happened to the mistaken celebrations of Ukraine's territorial advances in 2022. Territory may be a price; it is not a reliable indicator of strength.\n\nYet what about Ukrainians? They have been used as pawns by their Western friends from hell. They are still living under a regime that has just decided to mobilize even more of them for a hopeless meatgrinder, while Zelensky is admitting that Ukraine is on the verge of defeat.\n\nSome Western media are still telling a simplistic and false story about Ukrainians' unflagging and united will to hold out for victory, as if every single one owed the West to play a Marvel hero to the bitter end. But in reality Ukraine is a normal, if badly misled country. Many of its citizens have long shown what they really think about dying for a toxic combination of Western geopolitics and the narcissism of a megalomanic comedian: by evading the draft, either by hiding in Ukraine or fleeing abroad. In addition, a recent poll shows that almost 54 percent of Ukrainians find the motives of the draft dodgers at least understandable. Kiev's push for increased mobilization will not go smoothly.\n\nBut there is more evidence of the fact that Ukraine's society is not united behind a Kamikaze strategy of \"no compromise.\" Indeed, under the title \"The Line of Compromise,\" Strana.ua, one of Ukraine's most important and popular news sites, has just published a long, detailed article about three recent and methodologically sound polls.\n\nThey all bear on Ukrainians' evolving attitudes to the war and in particular the question of seeking a compromise peace. In addition, Strana offers a rich sample of comments by Ukrainian sociologists and political scientists. It is no exaggeration to say that the mere appearance of this article is a sign that the times are changing: Under the subtitle \"How and why attitudes to the war differ in the East and the West of Ukraine,\" it even highlights \"substantial\" regional differences and, really, suppressed divisions. If you know anything about the extreme political - even historical - sensitivity of such divergences in Ukraine, then you will agree that this framing alone is a small sensation.\n\nBut that is not all. The article, in effect, dwells on ending the war by concessions - because that is what any compromise necessarily will take. Readers learn, for instance, that, according to the 'Reiting' agency polling on commission of Ukraine's Veterans' Affairs Ministry, in Ukraine's West, farthest removed from the current front lines, 50% of poll respondents are against any compromise, while no less than 42% are in favor of compromise solutions as long as other countries (other than Ukraine and Russia, that is) are involved in finding them. For a region that, traditionally, has been the center of Ukrainian nationalism, that is, actually, a remarkably high share of those siding with compromise.\n\nIf you move east and south over the map, the compromise faction gets stronger. In the East, the proportions are almost exactly reversed: 41% against compromise and 51% in favor. In the South, it's a perfect tie: 47% for both sides.\n\nOn the whole, Ukrainian sociologists are finding a \"gradual increase\" of those supporting a \"compromise peace\" in \"one form or the other.\" Even if, as one researcher plausibly cautions, this increase displays different rates in different regions, it still adds up to the national trend. One of its causes is \"disappointment,\" the loss of faith in victory, as the political scientist Ruslan Bortnik observes. In other words, the Zelensky regime is losing the information war on the home front. Notwithstanding its mix of censorship and showmanship.\n\nThe compromises imagined by Ukrainians include all conceivable solutions that do not foresee a return to the 1991 borders. In other words, there are ever more Ukrainians who are ready to trade territory for peace. How much territory, that is, of course, a different question. But it is clear that the maximalist and counter-productive aim of \"getting everything back,\" the all-or-nothing delusion, imposed for so long on Ukrainian society, is losing its grip.\n\nThe agency Socis, for instance, counts a total of almost 45% of respondents ready for compromise, while only 33% want to continue the war until the 1991 borders are re-established. But there are also 11% who still favor fighting on until all territories lost after February 2022 are recovered. That, as well, is now an unrealistic aim. It may have been closer to reality when Kiev dismissed an almost finished peace deal in the spring of 2022, on awful Western advice. That ship has sailed.\n\nPolling results, it is important to note, do not all point in the same direction. The KMIS agency has produced results that show 58% of respondents who want to continue the war \"under any circumstances\" and only 32% who would prefer a \"freeze,\" if Western security guarantees are given. Such a freeze, while a favorite pipedream of some Western commentators, is unlikely to be an option now, if it ever was. Why should Moscow agree? But that is less relevant here than the fact that KMIS, for one, seems to have found a massive bedrock of pro-war sentiment.\n\nAnd yet, even here, the picture is more complicated once we look closer. For one thing, the KMIS poll is comparatively old, conducted in November and December of last year. Given how quickly things have been developing on the battlefield since then - the key town and fortress of Avdeevka, for instance, finally fell only in February 2024 - that makes its data very dated.\n\nKMIS also had interesting comments to offer: The agency notes that respondents' proximity to the front lines plays an \"important role\" in shaping their opinions about the war. In other words, when the fighting gets close enough to hear the artillery boom, it concentrates the mind on finding a way to end it, even by concessions. As one Ukrainian sociologist has put it, \"in the East and South ... one of people's main concerns is that the war must not reach their own home, their own home town.\"\n\nIn addition, the executive director of KMIS has observed that the number of compromise advocates also grows when Western aid declines.\n\nIt remains difficult to draw robust conclusions from these trends, for several reasons: First, as some Ukrainian observers point out, the number of compromise supporters may be even higher - personally, I am sure it is - because the Zelensky regime has stigmatized any appeal to diplomacy and negotiations as \"treason\" for so long. Many Ukrainians are virtually certain to be afraid to speak their mind on this issue.\n\nSecond, what exactly the compromise camp understands by compromise is bound to be diverse. This camp may still include quite a few citizens who harbor illusions about what kind of compromise is available at this point.\n\nThird, the current regime - which is de-facto authoritarian - is not answerable to society, at least not in a way that would make it easy to predict how shifts in the national mood translate into regime policies, or not.\n\nAnd yet: There is no doubt that there is a groundswell in favor of ending the war even at the cost of concessions. Add the clear evidence of Western Ukraine fatigue - even a growing readiness to cut Ukraine loose - and the facts that the Russian military is creating on the ground, and it becomes hard to see how this basal shift in the Ukrainian mood could not become an important factor of Ukrainian - and international - politics.",

        "text": "A high-ranking source in Moscow has commented on the Ukrainian leader's plans\n\nUkraine's previous attempt at beating Russia on the battlefield has been a total disaster and Kiev should not expect anything different the next time, a highly positioned official at the Russian Ministry of Defense told reporters on Thursday.\n\nIn an exclusive interview published by German newspaper Bild earlier this week, Zelensky revealed that Ukraine has \"a plan for a counteroffensive\" but would need more weapons and supplies from its Western backers.\n\n\"I would remind you that the implementation of the previous counteroffensive plan in 2023, which Commander-in-Chief Zelensky delicately dubbed 'not successful', resulted in the death and serious injury of more than 166,000 members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the loss of 789 tanks, 2,400 other armored vehicles and 132 aircraft,\" the MOD official said.\n\nWith Ukrainians unwilling to volunteer for the cause of \"Zelensky's madness,\" Kiev has updated its mobilization rules to recruit \"new cannon fodder,\" the official added.\n\nHowever, the Ukrainian leader apparently expects the West to arm and equip hundreds of thousands of newly mobilized troops, as Ukraine itself has long run out of weapons, equipment and even ammunition, the official pointed out. Meanwhile, the West's own cupboard is bare and the US and its allies are already \"stripping their own troops naked\" to supply Ukraine.\n\nThanks to such an approach to military planning, \"there is no doubt that the implementation of Zelensky's new plan for a counter-offensive will end in complete disaster for Ukraine, the final defeat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and the beginning of the path to peace on Russian terms,\" the official said.\n\nNATO members began arming Ukraine even before the conflict with Russia escalated in February 2022, starting with anti-tank missiles and later sending Soviet-made tanks, artillery and fighter jets. When Kiev began running out of those as well, the US and its allies sent their own guns, armored fighting vehicles and even main battle tanks such as the Leopard 2 and Abrams. All along, however, they have insisted that this does not make them a party to the conflict.\n\nAmerican and British generals helped plan Ukraine's grand counteroffensive last summer, believing that Western-made weapons would enable Kiev's troops to punch through Russian defenses. \"Nothing went as planned,\" according to a Washington Post analysis of the operation, published in December. After just four days, the Ukrainian command abandoned the Western strategy and tried using its own tactics, to just as little effect.\n\nZelensky has maintained that he can't negotiate with Russia as long as President Vladimir Putin remains in power and won't accept any settlement that does not include the full restoration of Ukraine's pre-2014 borders.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly vowed that all of the objectives of its military operation will be achieved, including the full demilitarization and \"denazification\" of Ukraine and ensuring it never joins a military alliance hostile to Russia.",

In other words, when the fighting gets close enough to hear the artillery boom, it concentrates the mind on finding a way to end it, even by concessions. As one Ukrainian sociologist has put it, \"in the East and South ... one of people's main concerns is that the war must not reach their own home, their own home town.\"\n\nIn addition, the executive director of KMIS has observed that the number of compromise advocates also grows when Western aid declines.\n\nIt remains difficult to draw robust conclusions from these trends, for several reasons: First, as some Ukrainian observers point out, the number of compromise supporters may be even higher - personally, I am sure it is - because the Zelensky regime has stigmatized any appeal to diplomacy and negotiations as \"treason\" for so long. Many Ukrainians are virtually certain to be afraid to speak their mind on this issue.\n\nSecond, what exactly the compromise camp understands by compromise is bound to be diverse. This camp may still include quite a few citizens who harbor illusions about what kind of compromise is available at this point.\n\nThird, the current regime - which is de-facto authoritarian - is not answerable to society, at least not in a way that would make it easy to predict how shifts in the national mood translate into regime policies, or not.\n\nAnd yet: There is no doubt that there is a groundswell in favor of ending the war even at the cost of concessions. Add the clear evidence of Western Ukraine fatigue - even a growing readiness to cut Ukraine loose - and the facts that the Russian military is creating on the ground, and it becomes hard to see how this basal shift in the Ukrainian mood could not become an important factor of Ukrainian - and international - politics.",

        "text": "Crude and gasoline prices on Thursday closed moderately lower. Thursday's rally in the dollar index to a 4-3/4 month high pressured energy prices. Crude also had some negative carryover from Wednesday when EIA crude inventories rose more than expected to a 9-month high.\n\nCrude oil prices have underlying support from Middle East tensions after US intelligence on Wednesday warned that Iran might launch an imminent missile or drone strike against military and government targets in Israel as revenge for the recent Israel airstrike on Iran's consulate in Syria that killed some top Iranian military commanders. An escalation of hostilities in the Middle East could lead to the disruption of crude supplies from the region.\n\nReduced crude demand in India, the world's third-largest crude consumer, is negative for oil prices after India's March oil demand fell -0.6% y/y to 21.09 MMT.\n\nCrude has support from the recent Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries that damaged several Russian oil processing facilities, limiting Russia's fuel exporting capacity. Russia's fuel exports in the week to April 7 fell by -450,000 bpd from the prior week to 3.39 million bpd. JPMorgan Chase said it sees 900,000 bpd of Russian refinery capacity that could be offline \"for several weeks if not months\" from the attacks, adding $4 a barrel of risk premium to oil prices.\n\nCrude prices have carryover support from last Wednesday when OPEC+, at its monthly meeting, did not recommend any changes to their existing crude output cuts, which kept about 2 million bpd of production cuts in place until the end of June. However, OPEC crude production in March rose +10,000 bpd to 26.860 million bpd, a bearish factor for oil prices as Iraq and UAE continue to pump above their production quotas.\n\nA decline in crude in floating storage is bullish for prices. Monday's weekly data from Vortexa showed that the amount of crude oil held worldwide on tankers that have been stationary for at least a week fell -17% w/w to 65.30 million bbl as of April 5.\n\nThe recent strength of Chinese crude oil demand is bullish for prices. Recent government data showed that China processed a record 118.76 MMT of crude in January and February, up +3% from the same time last year. Also, Chinese fuel demand jumped, with expressway passenger volumes 54% higher than 2019 levels, while airlines saw 19% more people than the pre-pandemic peak.\n\nCrude prices have underlying support from the Israel-Hamas war and concern that the war might spread to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Also, attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels have forced shippers to divert shipments around the southern tip of Africa instead of going through the Red Sea, disrupting global crude oil supplies.\n\nWednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of April 5 were -1.9% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -2.9% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -5.1% below the 5-year seasonal average. US crude oil production in the week ending April 5 was unchanged w/w at 13.1 million bpd, below the recent record high of 13.3 million bpd.\n\nBaker Hughes reported last Friday that active US oil rigs in the week ended April 5 rose by +2 rigs to 508 rigs, moderately above the 2-year low of 494 rigs posted on November 10. The number of US oil rigs has fallen over the past year from the 3-3/4 year high of 627 rigs posted in December 2022.\n\nMore Crude Oil News from Barchart\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Ukraine fatigue: Kiev and the West are tiring of war and each other",
        "text": "The idea of some form of compromise solution to Kiev-Moscow conflict is creeping up on foreign hawks and on more and more locals\n\nWhat a small band of objective-though-long-disparaged observers in the West have long warned about is now happening: Ukraine and the West are losing their war against Russia. The strategy of using Ukraine to either isolate and slowly suffocate Russia or to defeat and degrade it in a proxy war is coming to its predictable catastrophic end.\n\nThis reality is now being acknowledged even by key media and high officials that used to be uncompromising about pursuing the extremely ill-advised aim of military victory over Russia. A Washington Post article has explained that with \"no way out of a worsening war,\" Ukrainian President Zelensky's options \"look bad or worse.\" NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg has discovered the option of ending wars by concessions - Ukraine's concessions, that is. The sturdy old hardliner Edward Luttwak warns of a \"catastrophic defeat\" - for the West and Ukraine. True, Luttwak is still spreading desperate illusions about a direct NATO deployment to avert the worst. In reality, it would, of course, only make things much, much worse again, as in World War III worse. But his fear, not to say panic, is palpable.\n\nThe fast-approaching outcome will be a disaster for Ukraine, even if Moscow should be generous regarding the terms of a postwar settlement (not a given, after the costs that Russia has incurred). Ukraine has already been ruined in terms of its demography, territory, economy, and, last but not least, political future. The damage incurred cannot simply be undone and will have long-lasting consequences.\n\nFor the West, this war will also mark a dismal turning point, in four main ways that can only be sketched here:\n\nFirst, the US will have to absorb its worst defeat since Vietnam. Arguably, this latest fiasco is even worse because, even during the Vietnam War, America did not try to attack Russia (then, of course, leading the Soviet Union) as head-on as it does now. Washington's most over-confident attempt ever to take Moscow off the \"grand chessboard\" once and for all has backfired perfectly. In general, that will diminish America's capacity to impress and cajole globally. In particular, the goal of preventing the rise of regional hegemons in Eurasia, the holy grail of US geopolitics, is even farther out of reach than before. The \"unipolar\" moment and its illusions were passing anyhow, but the US leadership has added a textbook illustration of the West's limits.\n\nSecond, the EU and its individual members - especially myopic warmongers such as Germany, Poland, and France - are far worse off again: Their foolish abandoning of geopolitically imperative caution and balancing (remember: location, location, location) will cost them dearly.\n\nThird, in their own, different ways, cases such as Britain (not even an EU member anymore) and the Baltics (very exposed and very bellicose, a shortsighted combination) are in a class of their own: damage there will be galore. Damage control? The options are paltry.\n\nAnd, finally, there is, of course, NATO: Over-extended, self-depleted, and having gratuitously exposed itself as much weaker than it would like to seem. Its defeat by Russia in Ukraine will trigger centrifugal tendencies and blame games. Not to speak of the special potential for tension between the US and its clients/vassals in Europe, especially if Donald Trump wins the presidency again, as is likely. And, by the way, he can only thank NATO for proving his point about what a dubious proposition it has become. If you believe that having added more territory on the map (Sweden and Finland) was a \"win,\" just remember what has happened to the mistaken celebrations of Ukraine's territorial advances in 2022. Territory may be a price; it is not a reliable indicator of strength.\n\nYet what about Ukrainians? They have been used as pawns by their Western friends from hell. They are still living under a regime that has just decided to mobilize even more of them for a hopeless meatgrinder, while Zelensky is admitting that Ukraine is on the verge of defeat.\n\nSome Western media are still telling a simplistic and false story about Ukrainians' unflagging and united will to hold out for victory, as if every single one owed the West to play a Marvel hero to the bitter end. But in reality Ukraine is a normal, if badly misled country. Many of its citizens have long shown what they really think about dying for a toxic combination of Western geopolitics and the narcissism of a megalomanic comedian: by evading the draft, either by hiding in Ukraine or fleeing abroad. In addition, a recent poll shows that almost 54 percent of Ukrainians find the motives of the draft dodgers at least understandable. Kiev's push for increased mobilization will not go smoothly.\n\nBut there is more evidence of the fact that Ukraine's society is not united behind a Kamikaze strategy of \"no compromise.\" Indeed, under the title \"The Line of Compromise,\" Strana.ua, one of Ukraine's most important and popular news sites, has just published a long, detailed article about three recent and methodologically sound polls.\n\nThey all bear on Ukrainians' evolving attitudes to the war and in particular the question of seeking a compromise peace. In addition, Strana offers a rich sample of comments by Ukrainian sociologists and political scientists. It is no exaggeration to say that the mere appearance of this article is a sign that the times are changing: Under the subtitle \"How and why attitudes to the war differ in the East and the West of Ukraine,\" it even highlights \"substantial\" regional differences and, really, suppressed divisions. If you know anything about the extreme political - even historical - sensitivity of such divergences in Ukraine, then you will agree that this framing alone is a small sensation.\n\nBut that is not all. The article, in effect, dwells on ending the war by concessions - because that is what any compromise necessarily will take. Readers learn, for instance, that, according to the 'Reiting' agency polling on commission of Ukraine's Veterans' Affairs Ministry, in Ukraine's West, farthest removed from the current front lines, 50% of poll respondents are against any compromise, while no less than 42% are in favor of compromise solutions as long as other countries (other than Ukraine and Russia, that is) are involved in finding them. For a region that, traditionally, has been the center of Ukrainian nationalism, that is, actually, a remarkably high share of those siding with compromise.\n\nIf you move east and south over the map, the compromise faction gets stronger. In the East, the proportions are almost exactly reversed: 41% against compromise and 51% in favor. In the South, it's a perfect tie: 47% for both sides.\n\nOn the whole, Ukrainian sociologists are finding a \"gradual increase\" of those supporting a \"compromise peace\" in \"one form or the other.\" Even if, as one researcher plausibly cautions, this increase displays different rates in different regions, it still adds up to the national trend. One of its causes is \"disappointment,\" the loss of faith in victory, as the political scientist Ruslan Bortnik observes. In other words, the Zelensky regime is losing the information war on the home front. Notwithstanding its mix of censorship and showmanship.\n\nThe compromises imagined by Ukrainians include all conceivable solutions that do not foresee a return to the 1991 borders. In other words, there are ever more Ukrainians who are ready to trade territory for peace. How much territory, that is, of course, a different question. But it is clear that the maximalist and counter-productive aim of \"getting everything back,\" the all-or-nothing delusion, imposed for so long on Ukrainian society, is losing its grip.\n\nThe agency Socis, for instance, counts a total of almost 45% of respondents ready for compromise, while only 33% want to continue the war until the 1991 borders are re-established. But there are also 11% who still favor fighting on until all territories lost after February 2022 are recovered. That, as well, is now an unrealistic aim. It may have been closer to reality when Kiev dismissed an almost finished peace deal in the spring of 2022, on awful Western advice. That ship has sailed.\n\nPolling results, it is important to note, do not all point in the same direction. The KMIS agency has produced results that show 58% of respondents who want to continue the war \"under any circumstances\" and only 32% who would prefer a \"freeze,\" if Western security guarantees are given. Such a freeze, while a favorite pipedream of some Western commentators, is unlikely to be an option now, if it ever was. Why should Moscow agree? But that is less relevant here than the fact that KMIS, for one, seems to have found a massive bedrock of pro-war sentiment.\n\nAnd yet, even here, the picture is more complicated once we look closer. For one thing, the KMIS poll is comparatively old, conducted in November and December of last year. Given how quickly things have been developing on the battlefield since then - the key town and fortress of Avdeevka, for instance, finally fell only in February 2024 - that makes its data very dated.\n\nKMIS also had interesting comments to offer: The agency notes that respondents' proximity to the front lines plays an \"important role\" in shaping their opinions about the war. In other words, when the fighting gets close enough to hear the artillery boom, it concentrates the mind on finding a way to end it, even by concessions.

        "text": "A high-ranking source in Moscow has commented on the Ukrainian leader's plans\n\nUkraine's previous attempt at beating Russia on the battlefield has been a total disaster and Kiev should not expect anything different the next time, a highly positioned official at the Russian Ministry of Defense told reporters on Thursday.\n\nIn an exclusive interview published by German newspaper Bild earlier this week, Zelensky revealed that Ukraine has \"a plan for a counteroffensive\" but would need more weapons and supplies from its Western backers.\n\n\"I would remind you that the implementation of the previous counteroffensive plan in 2023, which Commander-in-Chief Zelensky delicately dubbed 'not successful', resulted in the death and serious injury of more than 166,000 members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the loss of 789 tanks, 2,400 other armored vehicles and 132 aircraft,\" the MOD official said.\n\nWith Ukrainians unwilling to volunteer for the cause of \"Zelensky's madness,\" Kiev has updated its mobilization rules to recruit \"new cannon fodder,\" the official added.\n\nHowever, the Ukrainian leader apparently expects the West to arm and equip hundreds of thousands of newly mobilized troops, as Ukraine itself has long run out of weapons, equipment and even ammunition, the official pointed out. Meanwhile, the West's own cupboard is bare and the US and its allies are already \"stripping their own troops naked\" to supply Ukraine.\n\nThanks to such an approach to military planning, \"there is no doubt that the implementation of Zelensky's new plan for a counter-offensive will end in complete disaster for Ukraine, the final defeat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and the beginning of the path to peace on Russian terms,\" the official said.\n\nNATO members began arming Ukraine even before the conflict with Russia escalated in February 2022, starting with anti-tank missiles and later sending Soviet-made tanks, artillery and fighter jets. When Kiev began running out of those as well, the US and its allies sent their own guns, armored fighting vehicles and even main battle tanks such as the Leopard 2 and Abrams. All along, however, they have insisted that this does not make them a party to the conflict.\n\nAmerican and British generals helped plan Ukraine's grand counteroffensive last summer, believing that Western-made weapons would enable Kiev's troops to punch through Russian defenses. \"Nothing went as planned,\" according to a Washington Post analysis of the operation, published in December. After just four days, the Ukrainian command abandoned the Western strategy and tried using its own tactics, to just as little effect.\n\nZelensky has maintained that he can't negotiate with Russia as long as President Vladimir Putin remains in power and won't accept any settlement that does not include the full restoration of Ukraine's pre-2014 borders.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly vowed that all of the objectives of its military operation will be achieved, including the full demilitarization and \"denazification\" of Ukraine and ensuring it never joins a military alliance hostile to Russia.",

Readers learn, for instance, that, according to the 'Reiting' agency polling on commission of Ukraine's Veterans' Affairs Ministry, in Ukraine's West, farthest removed from the current front lines, 50% of poll respondents are against any compromise, while no less than 42% are in favor of compromise solutions as long as other countries (other than Ukraine and Russia, that is) are involved in finding them. For a region that, traditionally, has been the center of Ukrainian nationalism, that is, actually, a remarkably high share of those siding with compromise.\n\nIf you move east and south over the map, the compromise faction gets stronger. In the East, the proportions are almost exactly reversed: 41% against compromise and 51% in favor. In the South, it's a perfect tie: 47% for both sides.\n\nOn the whole, Ukrainian sociologists are finding a \"gradual increase\" of those supporting a \"compromise peace\" in \"one form or the other.\" Even if, as one researcher plausibly cautions, this increase displays different rates in different regions, it still adds up to the national trend. One of its causes is \"disappointment,\" the loss of faith in victory, as the political scientist Ruslan Bortnik observes. In other words, the Zelensky regime is losing the information war on the home front. Notwithstanding its mix of censorship and showmanship.\n\nThe compromises imagined by Ukrainians include all conceivable solutions that do not foresee a return to the 1991 borders. In other words, there are ever more Ukrainians who are ready to trade territory for peace. How much territory, that is, of course, a different question. But it is clear that the maximalist and counter-productive aim of \"getting everything back,\" the all-or-nothing delusion, imposed for so long on Ukrainian society, is losing its grip.\n\nThe agency Socis, for instance, counts a total of almost 45% of respondents ready for compromise, while only 33% want to continue the war until the 1991 borders are re-established. But there are also 11% who still favor fighting on until all territories lost after February 2022 are recovered. That, as well, is now an unrealistic aim. It may have been closer to reality when Kiev dismissed an almost finished peace deal in the spring of 2022, on awful Western advice. That ship has sailed.\n\nPolling results, it is important to note, do not all point in the same direction. The KMIS agency has produced results that show 58% of respondents who want to continue the war \"under any circumstances\" and only 32% who would prefer a \"freeze,\" if Western security guarantees are given. Such a freeze, while a favorite pipedream of some Western commentators, is unlikely to be an option now, if it ever was. Why should Moscow agree? But that is less relevant here than the fact that KMIS, for one, seems to have found a massive bedrock of pro-war sentiment.\n\nAnd yet, even here, the picture is more complicated once we look closer. For one thing, the KMIS poll is comparatively old, conducted in November and December of last year. Given how quickly things have been developing on the battlefield since then - the key town and fortress of Avdeevka, for instance, finally fell only in February 2024 - that makes its data very dated.\n\nKMIS also had interesting comments to offer: The agency notes that respondents' proximity to the front lines plays an \"important role\" in shaping their opinions about the war. In other words, when the fighting gets close enough to hear the artillery boom, it concentrates the mind on finding a way to end it, even by concessions. As one Ukrainian sociologist has put it, \"in the East and South ... one of people's main concerns is that the war must not reach their own home, their own home town.\"\n\nIn addition, the executive director of KMIS has observed that the number of compromise advocates also grows when Western aid declines.\n\nIt remains difficult to draw robust conclusions from these trends, for several reasons: First, as some Ukrainian observers point out, the number of compromise supporters may be even higher - personally, I am sure it is - because the Zelensky regime has stigmatized any appeal to diplomacy and negotiations as \"treason\" for so long. Many Ukrainians are virtually certain to be afraid to speak their mind on this issue.\n\nSecond, what exactly the compromise camp understands by compromise is bound to be diverse. This camp may still include quite a few citizens who harbor illusions about what kind of compromise is available at this point.\n\nThird, the current regime - which is de-facto authoritarian - is not answerable to society, at least not in a way that would make it easy to predict how shifts in the national mood translate into regime policies, or not.\n\nAnd yet: There is no doubt that there is a groundswell in favor of ending the war even at the cost of concessions. Add the clear evidence of Western Ukraine fatigue - even a growing readiness to cut Ukraine loose - and the facts that the Russian military is creating on the ground, and it becomes hard to see how this basal shift in the Ukrainian mood could not become an important factor of Ukrainian - and international - politics.",

        "text": "A high-ranking source in Moscow has commented on the Ukrainian leader's plans\n\nUkraine's previous attempt at beating Russia on the battlefield has been a total disaster and Kiev should not expect anything different the next time, a highly positioned official at the Russian Ministry of Defense told reporters on Thursday.\n\nIn an exclusive interview published by German newspaper Bild earlier this week, Zelensky revealed that Ukraine has \"a plan for a counteroffensive\" but would need more weapons and supplies from its Western backers.\n\n\"I would remind you that the implementation of the previous counteroffensive plan in 2023, which Commander-in-Chief Zelensky delicately dubbed 'not successful', resulted in the death and serious injury of more than 166,000 members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as the loss of 789 tanks, 2,400 other armored vehicles and 132 aircraft,\" the MOD official said.\n\nWith Ukrainians unwilling to volunteer for the cause of \"Zelensky's madness,\" Kiev has updated its mobilization rules to recruit \"new cannon fodder,\" the official added.\n\nHowever, the Ukrainian leader apparently expects the West to arm and equip hundreds of thousands of newly mobilized troops, as Ukraine itself has long run out of weapons, equipment and even ammunition, the official pointed out. Meanwhile, the West's own cupboard is bare and the US and its allies are already \"stripping their own troops naked\" to supply Ukraine.\n\nThanks to such an approach to military planning, \"there is no doubt that the implementation of Zelensky's new plan for a counter-offensive will end in complete disaster for Ukraine, the final defeat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and the beginning of the path to peace on Russian terms,\" the official said.\n\nNATO members began arming Ukraine even before the conflict with Russia escalated in February 2022, starting with anti-tank missiles and later sending Soviet-made tanks, artillery and fighter jets. When Kiev began running out of those as well, the US and its allies sent their own guns, armored fighting vehicles and even main battle tanks such as the Leopard 2 and Abrams. All along, however, they have insisted that this does not make them a party to the conflict.\n\nAmerican and British generals helped plan Ukraine's grand counteroffensive last summer, believing that Western-made weapons would enable Kiev's troops to punch through Russian defenses. \"Nothing went as planned,\" according to a Washington Post analysis of the operation, published in December. After just four days, the Ukrainian command abandoned the Western strategy and tried using its own tactics, to just as little effect.\n\nZelensky has maintained that he can't negotiate with Russia as long as President Vladimir Putin remains in power and won't accept any settlement that does not include the full restoration of Ukraine's pre-2014 borders.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly vowed that all of the objectives of its military operation will be achieved, including the full demilitarization and \"denazification\" of Ukraine and ensuring it never joins a military alliance hostile to Russia.",

        "title": "Ukraine fatigue: Kiev and the West are tiring of war and each other",
        "text": "The idea of some form of compromise solution to Kiev-Moscow conflict is creeping up on foreign hawks and on more and more locals\n\nWhat a small band of objective-though-long-disparaged observers in the West have long warned about is now happening: Ukraine and the West are losing their war against Russia. The strategy of using Ukraine to either isolate and slowly suffocate Russia or to defeat and degrade it in a proxy war is coming to its predictable catastrophic end.\n\nThis reality is now being acknowledged even by key media and high officials that used to be uncompromising about pursuing the extremely ill-advised aim of military victory over Russia. A Washington Post article has explained that with \"no way out of a worsening war,\" Ukrainian President Zelensky's options \"look bad or worse.\" NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg has discovered the option of ending wars by concessions - Ukraine's concessions, that is. The sturdy old hardliner Edward Luttwak warns of a \"catastrophic defeat\" - for the West and Ukraine. True, Luttwak is still spreading desperate illusions about a direct NATO deployment to avert the worst. In reality, it would, of course, only make things much, much worse again, as in World War III worse. But his fear, not to say panic, is palpable.\n\nThe fast-approaching outcome will be a disaster for Ukraine, even if Moscow should be generous regarding the terms of a postwar settlement (not a given, after the costs that Russia has incurred). Ukraine has already been ruined in terms of its demography, territory, economy, and, last but not least, political future. The damage incurred cannot simply be undone and will have long-lasting consequences.\n\nFor the West, this war will also mark a dismal turning point, in four main ways that can only be sketched here:\n\nFirst, the US will have to absorb its worst defeat since Vietnam. Arguably, this latest fiasco is even worse because, even during the Vietnam War, America did not try to attack Russia (then, of course, leading the Soviet Union) as head-on as it does now. Washington's most over-confident attempt ever to take Moscow off the \"grand chessboard\" once and for all has backfired perfectly. In general, that will diminish America's capacity to impress and cajole globally. In particular, the goal of preventing the rise of regional hegemons in Eurasia, the holy grail of US geopolitics, is even farther out of reach than before. The \"unipolar\" moment and its illusions were passing anyhow, but the US leadership has added a textbook illustration of the West's limits.\n\nSecond, the EU and its individual members - especially myopic warmongers such as Germany, Poland, and France - are far worse off again: Their foolish abandoning of geopolitically imperative caution and balancing (remember: location, location, location) will cost them dearly.\n\nThird, in their own, different ways, cases such as Britain (not even an EU member anymore) and the Baltics (very exposed and very bellicose, a shortsighted combination) are in a class of their own: damage there will be galore. Damage control? The options are paltry.\n\nAnd, finally, there is, of course, NATO: Over-extended, self-depleted, and having gratuitously exposed itself as much weaker than it would like to seem. Its defeat by Russia in Ukraine will trigger centrifugal tendencies and blame games. Not to speak of the special potential for tension between the US and its clients/vassals in Europe, especially if Donald Trump wins the presidency again, as is likely. And, by the way, he can only thank NATO for proving his point about what a dubious proposition it has become. If you believe that having added more territory on the map (Sweden and Finland) was a \"win,\" just remember what has happened to the mistaken celebrations of Ukraine's territorial advances in 2022. Territory may be a price; it is not a reliable indicator of strength.\n\nYet what about Ukrainians? They have been used as pawns by their Western friends from hell. They are still living under a regime that has just decided to mobilize even more of them for a hopeless meatgrinder, while Zelensky is admitting that Ukraine is on the verge of defeat.\n\nSome Western media are still telling a simplistic and false story about Ukrainians' unflagging and united will to hold out for victory, as if every single one owed the West to play a Marvel hero to the bitter end. But in reality Ukraine is a normal, if badly misled country. Many of its citizens have long shown what they really think about dying for a toxic combination of Western geopolitics and the narcissism of a megalomanic comedian: by evading the draft, either by hiding in Ukraine or fleeing abroad. In addition, a recent poll shows that almost 54 percent of Ukrainians find the motives of the draft dodgers at least understandable. Kiev's push for increased mobilization will not go smoothly.\n\nBut there is more evidence of the fact that Ukraine's society is not united behind a Kamikaze strategy of \"no compromise.\" Indeed, under the title \"The Line of Compromise,\" Strana.ua, one of Ukraine's most important and popular news sites, has just published a long, detailed article about three recent and methodologically sound polls.\n\nThey all bear on Ukrainians' evolving attitudes to the war and in particular the question of seeking a compromise peace. In addition, Strana offers a rich sample of comments by Ukrainian sociologists and political scientists. It is no exaggeration to say that the mere appearance of this article is a sign that the times are changing: Under the subtitle \"How and why attitudes to the war differ in the East and the West of Ukraine,\" it even highlights \"substantial\" regional differences and, really, suppressed divisions. If you know anything about the extreme political - even historical - sensitivity of such divergences in Ukraine, then you will agree that this framing alone is a small sensation.\n\nBut that is not all. The article, in effect, dwells on ending the war by concessions - because that is what any compromise necessarily will take.

Meanwhile, the West's own cupboard is bare and the US and its allies are already \"stripping their own troops naked\" to supply Ukraine.\n\nThanks to such an approach to military planning, \"there is no doubt that the implementation of Zelensky's new plan for a counter-offensive will end in complete disaster for Ukraine, the final defeat of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and the beginning of the path to peace on Russian terms,\" the official said.\n\nNATO members began arming Ukraine even before the conflict with Russia escalated in February 2022, starting with anti-tank missiles and later sending Soviet-made tanks, artillery and fighter jets. When Kiev began running out of those as well, the US and its allies sent their own guns, armored fighting vehicles and even main battle tanks such as the Leopard 2 and Abrams. All along, however, they have insisted that this does not make them a party to the conflict.\n\nAmerican and British generals helped plan Ukraine's grand counteroffensive last summer, believing that Western-made weapons would enable Kiev's troops to punch through Russian defenses. \"Nothing went as planned,\" according to a Washington Post analysis of the operation, published in December. After just four days, the Ukrainian command abandoned the Western strategy and tried using its own tactics, to just as little effect.\n\nZelensky has maintained that he can't negotiate with Russia as long as President Vladimir Putin remains in power and won't accept any settlement that does not include the full restoration of Ukraine's pre-2014 borders.\n\nMoscow has repeatedly vowed that all of the objectives of its military operation will be achieved, including the full demilitarization and \"denazification\" of Ukraine and ensuring it never joins a military alliance hostile to Russia.",

        "title": "FBI Director to Warn Congress of 'Diverse' Threats to US From 'Myriad Sources'",
        "text": "In an anticipated address to the House Appropriations Committee Thursday afternoon, FBI Director Christopher Wray is set to outline a concerning landscape of threats against the United States, stressing the challenges posed by a mix of nation-states, hostile foreign intelligence services, criminals, and technology-driven exploits.\n\nAccording to Mr. Wray, the United States faces an unprecedented range of dangers, from homegrown violent extremists and cyberattacks to the sexual exploitation of children online and human trafficking.\n\nThe agency's budget request proposal, of which Mr. Wray will present to the appropriations committee, outlines $11.3 billion in proposed spending.\n\n\"The threat from terrorism is as persistent and complex as ever,\" Mr. Wray said in prepared remarks. \"As we saw in October with the devastating attack in Israel, terrorist actors are still very intent on using violence and brutality to spread their ideologies. We are in an environment where the threats from international terrorism (IT), domestic terrorism (DT), and state sponsored terrorism are all simultaneously elevated.\"\n\nThe two main threats Mr. Wray is expected to bring up are lone offender threats from domestic violent extremists (DVEs) and homegrown violent extremists (HVEs).\n\nDVEs, the agency says, are individuals based and operating mostly within the United States without inspiration or direction from foreign groups, while HVEs can be actors of any nationality who are motivated by foreign terrorist organizations (FTOs) but act independently of them.\n\nMr. Wray said these actors are turning focus on \"accessible targets\" such as \"civilians, law enforcement and the military, symbols or members of the U.S. government, houses of worship, retail locations, and public mass gatherings.\"\n\nMr. Wray pointed to an increase in domestic terrorism investigations, which has more than doubled since spring 2020, alongside the significant number of international terrorism investigations.\n\nAccording to Mr. Wray's remarks, at the end of Fiscal Year 2023, the agency was conducting approximately 2,700 domestic terrorism investigations and approximately 4,000 international terrorism investigations.\n\nMr. Wray is also expected to bring up the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas and its implications on the U.S. homeland.\n\n\"While we assist our Israeli colleagues and we understand the global implications of the ongoing conflict in Israel, we are paying heightened attention to how the events abroad could directly affect and inspire people to commit violence here in the Homeland,\" Mr. Wray said in the prepared remarks.\n\nMr. Wray said terrorist organizations worldwide have praised Hamas's attack on Israeli civilians, and extremists across ideologies seek to target Jewish and Muslim people through physical assaults, bomb threats, and online calls for mass casualty attacks.\n\n\"Presently, we have no information to indicate that Hamas has the intent or capability to conduct operations inside the United States, though we cannot, and do not, discount that possibility, but we are especially concerned about the possibility of Hamas supporters engaging in violence on the group's behalf,\" Mr. Wray added in his remarks.\n\nDespite losing physical territories, ISIS remains a significant concern due to its adept use of social media to recruit and radicalize individuals for violence. ISIS-K, an offshoot of the terrorist group based mostly in Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for the attack near Russia's capital last month.\n\nMr. Wray also addressed concerns regarding Iran and its proxies, such as the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and Lebanese Hizballah, emphasizing their efforts to plan and execute attacks against the United States and its allies.\n\n\"Hizballah has sent operatives to build terrorist infrastructure worldwide,\" Mr. Wray said in the prepared remarks. \"The arrests of individuals in the United States allegedly linked to Hizballah's main overseas terrorist arm, and their intelligence-collection and -procurement efforts, demonstrate Hizballah's interest in long-term contingency planning activities here in the Homeland. Hizballah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah has also threatened retaliation for the death of IRGC-QF Commander Qassem Soleimani.\"\n\n\"In conclusion, the threats we face as a nation have never been greater or more diverse and the expectations placed on the FBI have never been higher,\" he is expected to say. \"Our fellow citizens look to the FBI to protect the United States from all of those threats, and the men and women of the FBI continue to meet and exceed those expectations, every day. I want to thank them for their dedicated service. I also want to pledge to this Committee to be good stewards of the resources provided.\"",

        "text": "Crude and gasoline prices this morning are moderately lower. Today's rally in the dollar index to a 4-3/4 month high pressured energy prices. Crude also has some negative carryover from Wednesday when EIA crude inventories rose more than expected to a 9-month high.\n\nCrude oil prices have underlying support from Middle East tensions after US intelligence on Wednesday said that Iran might launch an imminent missile or drone strike against military and government targets in Israel as revenge for the recent Israel airstrike on Iran's consulate in Syria that killed some top Iranian military commanders. An escalation of hostilities in the Middle East could lead to the disruption of crude supplies from the region.\n\nReduced crude demand in India, the world's third-largest crude consumer, is negative for oil prices after India's March oil demand fell -0.6% y/y to 21.09 MMT.\n\nCrude has support from the recent Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries that damaged several Russian oil processing facilities, limiting Russia's fuel exporting capacity. Russia's fuel exports in the week to April 7 fell by -450,000 bpd from the prior week to 3.39 million bpd. JPMorgan Chase said it sees 900,000 bpd of Russian refinery capacity that could be offline \"for several weeks if not months\" from the attacks, adding $4 a barrel of risk premium to oil prices.\n\nCrude prices have carryover support from last Wednesday when OPEC+, at its monthly meeting, did not recommend any changes to their existing crude output cuts, which kept about 2 million bpd of production cuts in place until the end of June. However, OPEC crude production in March rose +10,000 bpd to 26.860 million bpd, a bearish factor for oil prices as Iraq and UAE continue to pump above their production quotas.\n\nA decline in crude in floating storage is bullish for prices. Monday's weekly data from Vortexa showed that the amount of crude oil held worldwide on tankers that have been stationary for at least a week fell -17% w/w to 65.30 million bbl as of April 5.\n\nThe recent strength of Chinese crude oil demand is bullish for prices. Recent government data showed that China processed a record 118.76 MMT of crude in January and February, up +3% from the same time last year. Also, Chinese fuel demand jumped, with expressway passenger volumes 54% higher than 2019 levels, while airlines saw 19% more people than the pre-pandemic peak.\n\nCrude prices have underlying support from the Israel-Hamas war and concern that the war might spread to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Also, attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels have forced shippers to divert shipments around the southern tip of Africa instead of going through the Red Sea, disrupting global crude oil supplies.\n\nWednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of April 5 were -1.9% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -2.9% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -5.1% below the 5-year seasonal average. US crude oil production in the week ending April 5 was unchanged w/w at 13.1 million bpd, below the recent record high of 13.3 million bpd.\n\nBaker Hughes reported last Friday that active US oil rigs in the week ended April 5 rose by +2 rigs to 508 rigs, moderately above the 2-year low of 494 rigs posted on November 10. The number of US oil rigs has fallen over the past year from the 3-3/4 year high of 627 rigs posted in December 2022.\n\nMore Crude Oil News from Barchart\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Tehran has avoided direct confrontation with Israel or the United States, while declaring support for its allies.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called on her Iranian counterpart Hossein Amirabdollahian to urge \"maximum restraint\" to avoid further escalation.\n\nRussia's foreign ministry told citizens they should not travel to the Middle East, especially to Israel, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories.\n\n\"Right now it's very important for everyone to maintain restraint so as not to lead to a complete destabilisation of the situation in the region, which doesn't exactly shine with stability and predictability,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told a news briefing.\n\nBIDEN SAYS IRAN THREATENS 'SIGNIFICANT ATTACK IN ISRAEL'\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden said on Wednesday Iran was threatening to launch a \"significant attack in Israel\", and that he had told Netanyahu that \"our commitment to Israel security against these threats from Iran and its proxies is iron-clad\".\n\nIran is the third-largest oil producer in the OPEC group and oil prices stayed near six-month highs on Thursday.\n\nLate on Wednesday, an Iranian news agency published an Arabic report on the X platform saying the air space over Tehran had been closed for military drills, but then removed the report and denied it had issued such news.\n\nLufthansa said it would probably not fly to Tehran before April 13. Austrian Airlines said it was still planning to fly on Thursday but was adjusting timings to avoid crew having to disembark for an overnight layover.\n\nIranian air space is also a key overflight route for Emirates' and Qatar Airways' flights to Europe and North America.\n\nEmirates, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Aeroflot and Air Arabia, among the airlines that fly to Tehran, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\n(Reporting by Ilona Wissenbach in Frankfurt, Shariq Khan in New York, Emily Chow in Singapore; Writing by Tom Perry, Ros Russell and Andrew Heavens; Editing by Kevin Liffey)",

        "text": "During the ongoing Ukraine war, the Ukrainian forces have targeted the nuclear power generating station at Zaporizhzhia, which was captured by the Russian forces in 2022\n\nOne of the alarming aspects of the current Russia-Ukraine war is the risk of a nuclear catastrophe at the nuclear plant Zaporizhzhia, which was captured by the Russians in the summer of 2022. The nuclear power plant is the largest in Europe and the tenth largest in the world.\n\nThe Ukrainian forces have been shelling the plant and, of late, attacking the nuclear complex with drones. The UN and lately the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell have raised worries about a nuclear disaster, akin to the Chernobyl nuclear complex, also in Ukraine, where an accident in 1986 caused widespread environmental and human health issues, and a nuclear scare in the rest of the world.\n\nA military attack on a nuclear reactor can have catastrophic consequences, including a meltdown that can cause a large number of human casualties in the immediate vicinity of such a facility, but also place the civilian population not just in the vicinity of the target but over large contiguous areas at risk of gamma radiation, which causes serious health problems and, in the long-term, cancer.\n\nThe world came to know about the cataclysmic power of atomic bombs, when two of them were used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II in Japan, raising worldwide awareness of the horrific potential of military uses of such mass destruction weapons.\n\nBut even nuclear reactors for peaceful uses, such as the generation of electric power, are a source of passive danger, with the unintended leak of radiation, or due to accidents. Although advocates of nuclear energy have claimed that it is the safest and cleanest source of power compared to environmentally dangerous sources such as coal and petroleum products, accidents such as the Three Mile Island accident in the US, the Chernobyl tragedy of 1986 in Ukraine, and the Fukushima catastrophe of 2011 in Japan have raised questions about the safety of nuclear installations.\n\nWhile such cataclysmic events, caused accidentally or by human negligence, pose great danger by themselves, targeting nuclear installations during conflict could pose an even greater danger.\n\nIn the past, nuclear installations have been targets of attacks. In 1980, at the beginning of the Iran-Iraq war, the buildings in the Osirak reactor complex in Iraq were attacked by the Iranian forces, although the reactor itself was not targeted. In 1981, the Israelis attacked and destroyed the complex.\n\nDuring the Iran-Iraq war, Iraqi forces launched attacks on the Bushehr nuclear complex in Iran, where two nuclear reactors were under construction. During the First Gulf War, the US attacked the Tuwaitha Research Centre, and allied facilities in Iraq, on suspicion of Saddam Hussein building 'weapons of mass destruction\". In 2007, Israeli air strikes destroyed the al-Kibar reactor in Syria. In 2014, Hamas launched unsuccessful attacks on the Israeli nuclear reactor at Dimona.\n\nNone of these attacks resulted in catastrophic events because most of them were at the construction stage, but the risk of a fully functional reactor being attacked remains. The Ukrainian shelling of the Zaporizhzhia reactor, the world's tenth-largest reactor and Europe's largest, on which drone attacks have been reported, raised fears of such a disaster.\n\nIn the aftermath of the cataclysmic effect of nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, subsequent awareness about the horrific consequences of attacks on nuclear facilities dawned on the world, and the need for suitable amendments to international humanitarian law was felt, in particular appropriate additions to the 1949 Geneva Conventions.\n\nAdditional Protocols I and II were added to the Conventions' legal framework, specifically prohibited attacks on nuclear power plants. Apart from these protocols, the only other regional protocols that exist are the Pelindaba Treaty, which declares Africa a nuclear-free zone, and the India-Pakistan Treaty, which precludes attacks on each other's nuclear installations. As part of the agreement signed on December 31, 1988, inform each other of the nuclear installations and facilities to be covered under the Agreement on the first of January of every calendar year.\n\nHowever, the international laws governing protection for nuclear reactors in conflict zones are not water-tight.\n\nIn a paper he wrote for the Vienna Center for Disarmament and Non-Proliferation (VCDNP), nuclear disarmament studies scholar John Carlson points out the loopholes.\n\nArticle 56 of the Geneva Conventions, 'Protection of works and installations containing dangerous forces' states:\n\nJohnson points out the anomalies Clause 2 of Article 56 carries. \"Regrettably, this prohibition is qualified; it does not apply if a nuclear electrical generating station \"... provides electric power in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support,\" Johnson writes, pointing out the incongruity of such a caveat, which is self-contradictory.\n\nHe also points out that Article 56, which seeks to prevent attacks on nuclear power plants that can result in cataclysmic radiation releases and not other nuclear facilities that are also capable of such leaks, such as \"large research reactors, reprocessing plants, spent fuel storage facilities, and high-level waste storage facilities,\" that also call for protection against attacks.\n\nSuch incongruity, in international laws, needs to be plugged, he argues. And the need to amend Article 56 may have become more urgent than ever, in light of the dangers of the attacks on the Zaporizhzhia nuclear complex.",

        "title": "Does American Library Association Back Books on Ukrainian Nazi Collaborators?",
        "text": "https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e8/04/0b/1117871690_0:0:3072:1728_1920x0_80_0_0_62aa19164a6bd7b0d955503c81d8abed.jpg.webpThe American Library Association (ALA) recently honored two authors with a track record of whitewashing Nazi collaborators in Ukraine, journalist Lev Golovkin has written in an article for the US news outlet The Nation.The world's largest non-profit library organization did not think twice before drawing attention to the books edited by Volodymyr Viatrovych - now a Ukrainian MP - and Lubomyr Luciuk, who is currently a professor in Canada's elite military college.Golovkin recalled that the ALA earlier published a list of Best Historical Materials for 2023, which included Enemy Archives: Soviet Counterinsurgency Operations and the Ukrainian Nationalist Movement -- Selections from the Secret Police Archives.He recounted in this regard that Viatrovych is notoriously known for calling soldiers from an SS division \"war victims,\" while Luciuk once demanded that the Canadian parliament apologize for calling a former member of SS a Nazi.What's more, it was Luciuk who added significantly to glorifying the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and its offshoot, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), which were to blame for exterminating tens of thousands of Jews during World War II.At the time, the Kiev regime greenlighted laws declaring the OUN and the UPA to be Ukrainian national heroes and making it illegal to deny their \"heroism\", a move that provoked international uproar.In 2018, Viatrovych went further by berating then-Israeli President Reuven Rivlin for \"spreading the Soviet myth about the OUN's participation in the Holocaust,\" something that is an established historical fact. A year later, Viatrovych was fired as UINM head before quietly becoming a member of the Ukrainian parliament.Singing the same tune was Luciuk, who published an edited excerpt from the Enemy Archives book in Canada's National Post newspaper, in which he described the OUN as having been maligned by the USSR. Luciuk alleged that the Soviet Union \"routinely portrayed OUN members as war criminals, Nazi collaborators, fascists and so on, a trope regurgitated regularly by the Russian Federation.\"As for Luciuk, he also vehemently stood for the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS, commonly known as SS Galizien, notorious for its war crimes, such as the burning of up to 1,000 Polish villagers alive during World War II. Luciuk, however, claimed that SS Galizien members \"weren't pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic and they didn't engage in war crimes.\"Meanwhile, glorifying Nazi collaborators remains an essential part of the Kiev regime's policy, and opening monuments to the war criminals in Ukraine becoming a common event. Russian President Vladimir Putin noted in this vein that \"the glorification of Nazi criminals, and direct propaganda of Nazism in Ukraine become the norm, as if there was no Nuremberg [Trials].\"",

        "title": "Ukraine fatigue: Kiev and the West are tiring of war and each other",
        "text": "The idea of some form of compromise solution to Kiev-Moscow conflict is creeping up on foreign hawks and on more and more locals\n\nWhat a small band of objective-though-long-disparaged observers in the West have long warned about is now happening: Ukraine and the West are losing their war against Russia. The strategy of using Ukraine to either isolate and slowly suffocate Russia or to defeat and degrade it in a proxy war is coming to its predictable catastrophic end.\n\nThis reality is now being acknowledged even by key media and high officials that used to be uncompromising about pursuing the extremely ill-advised aim of military victory over Russia. A Washington Post article has explained that with \"no way out of a worsening war,\" Ukrainian President Zelensky's options \"look bad or worse.\" NATO General Secretary Jens Stoltenberg has discovered the option of ending wars by concessions - Ukraine's concessions, that is. The sturdy old hardliner Edward Luttwak warns of a \"catastrophic defeat\" - for the West and Ukraine. True, Luttwak is still spreading desperate illusions about a direct NATO deployment to avert the worst. In reality, it would, of course, only make things much, much worse again, as in World War III worse. But his fear, not to say panic, is palpable.\n\nThe fast-approaching outcome will be a disaster for Ukraine, even if Moscow should be generous regarding the terms of a postwar settlement (not a given, after the costs that Russia has incurred). Ukraine has already been ruined in terms of its demography, territory, economy, and, last but not least, political future. The damage incurred cannot simply be undone and will have long-lasting consequences.\n\nFor the West, this war will also mark a dismal turning point, in four main ways that can only be sketched here:\n\nFirst, the US will have to absorb its worst defeat since Vietnam. Arguably, this latest fiasco is even worse because, even during the Vietnam War, America did not try to attack Russia (then, of course, leading the Soviet Union) as head-on as it does now. Washington's most over-confident attempt ever to take Moscow off the \"grand chessboard\" once and for all has backfired perfectly. In general, that will diminish America's capacity to impress and cajole globally. In particular, the goal of preventing the rise of regional hegemons in Eurasia, the holy grail of US geopolitics, is even farther out of reach than before. The \"unipolar\" moment and its illusions were passing anyhow, but the US leadership has added a textbook illustration of the West's limits.\n\nSecond, the EU and its individual members - especially myopic warmongers such as Germany, Poland, and France - are far worse off again: Their foolish abandoning of geopolitically imperative caution and balancing (remember: location, location, location) will cost them dearly.\n\nThird, in their own, different ways, cases such as Britain (not even an EU member anymore) and the Baltics (very exposed and very bellicose, a shortsighted combination) are in a class of their own: damage there will be galore. Damage control? The options are paltry.\n\nAnd, finally, there is, of course, NATO: Over-extended, self-depleted, and having gratuitously exposed itself as much weaker than it would like to seem. Its defeat by Russia in Ukraine will trigger centrifugal tendencies and blame games. Not to speak of the special potential for tension between the US and its clients/vassals in Europe, especially if Donald Trump wins the presidency again, as is likely. And, by the way, he can only thank NATO for proving his point about what a dubious proposition it has become. If you believe that having added more territory on the map (Sweden and Finland) was a \"win,\" just remember what has happened to the mistaken celebrations of Ukraine's territorial advances in 2022. Territory may be a price; it is not a reliable indicator of strength.\n\nYet what about Ukrainians? They have been used as pawns by their Western friends from hell. They are still living under a regime that has just decided to mobilize even more of them for a hopeless meatgrinder, while Zelensky is admitting that Ukraine is on the verge of defeat.\n\nSome Western media are still telling a simplistic and false story about Ukrainians' unflagging and united will to hold out for victory, as if every single one owed the West to play a Marvel hero to the bitter end. But in reality Ukraine is a normal, if badly misled country. Many of its citizens have long shown what they really think about dying for a toxic combination of Western geopolitics and the narcissism of a megalomanic comedian: by evading the draft, either by hiding in Ukraine or fleeing abroad. In addition, a recent poll shows that almost 54 percent of Ukrainians find the motives of the draft dodgers at least understandable. Kiev's push for increased mobilization will not go smoothly.\n\nBut there is more evidence of the fact that Ukraine's society is not united behind a Kamikaze strategy of \"no compromise.\" Indeed, under the title \"The Line of Compromise,\" Strana.ua, one of Ukraine's most important and popular news sites, has just published a long, detailed article about three recent and methodologically sound polls.\n\nThey all bear on Ukrainians' evolving attitudes to the war and in particular the question of seeking a compromise peace. In addition, Strana offers a rich sample of comments by Ukrainian sociologists and political scientists. It is no exaggeration to say that the mere appearance of this article is a sign that the times are changing: Under the subtitle \"How and why attitudes to the war differ in the East and the West of Ukraine,\" it even highlights \"substantial\" regional differences and, really, suppressed divisions. If you know anything about the extreme political - even historical - sensitivity of such divergences in Ukraine, then you will agree that this framing alone is a small sensation.\n\nBut that is not all. The article, in effect, dwells on ending the war by concessions - because that is what any compromise necessarily will take. Readers learn, for instance, that, according to the 'Reiting' agency polling on commission of Ukraine's Veterans' Affairs Ministry, in Ukraine's West, farthest removed from the current front lines, 50% of poll respondents are against any compromise, while no less than 42% are in favor of compromise solutions as long as other countries (other than Ukraine and Russia, that is) are involved in finding them. For a region that, traditionally, has been the center of Ukrainian nationalism, that is, actually, a remarkably high share of those siding with compromise.\n\nIf you move east and south over the map, the compromise faction gets stronger. In the East, the proportions are almost exactly reversed: 41% against compromise and 51% in favor. In the South, it's a perfect tie: 47% for both sides.\n\nOn the whole, Ukrainian sociologists are finding a \"gradual increase\" of those supporting a \"compromise peace\" in \"one form or the other.\" Even if, as one researcher plausibly cautions, this increase displays different rates in different regions, it still adds up to the national trend. One of its causes is \"disappointment,\" the loss of faith in victory, as the political scientist Ruslan Bortnik observes. In other words, the Zelensky regime is losing the information war on the home front. Notwithstanding its mix of censorship and showmanship.\n\nThe compromises imagined by Ukrainians include all conceivable solutions that do not foresee a return to the 1991 borders. In other words, there are ever more Ukrainians who are ready to trade territory for peace. How much territory, that is, of course, a different question. But it is clear that the maximalist and counter-productive aim of \"getting everything back,\" the all-or-nothing delusion, imposed for so long on Ukrainian society, is losing its grip.\n\nThe agency Socis, for instance, counts a total of almost 45% of respondents ready for compromise, while only 33% want to continue the war until the 1991 borders are re-established. But there are also 11% who still favor fighting on until all territories lost after February 2022 are recovered. That, as well, is now an unrealistic aim. It may have been closer to reality when Kiev dismissed an almost finished peace deal in the spring of 2022, on awful Western advice. That ship has sailed.\n\nPolling results, it is important to note, do not all point in the same direction. The KMIS agency has produced results that show 58% of respondents who want to continue the war \"under any circumstances\" and only 32% who would prefer a \"freeze,\" if Western security guarantees are given. Such a freeze, while a favorite pipedream of some Western commentators, is unlikely to be an option now, if it ever was. Why should Moscow agree? But that is less relevant here than the fact that KMIS, for one, seems to have found a massive bedrock of pro-war sentiment.\n\nAnd yet, even here, the picture is more complicated once we look closer. For one thing, the KMIS poll is comparatively old, conducted in November and December of last year. Given how quickly things have been developing on the battlefield since then - the key town and fortress of Avdeevka, for instance, finally fell only in February 2024 - that makes its data very dated.\n\nKMIS also had interesting comments to offer: The agency notes that respondents' proximity to the front lines plays an \"important role\" in shaping their opinions about the war. In other words, when the fighting gets close enough to hear the artillery boom, it concentrates the mind on finding a way to end it, even by concessions. As one Ukrainian sociologist has put it, \"in the East and South ... one of people's main concerns is that the war must not reach their own home, their own home town.\"\n\nIn addition, the executive director of KMIS has observed that the number of compromise advocates also grows when Western aid declines.\n\nIt remains difficult to draw robust conclusions from these trends, for several reasons: First, as some Ukrainian observers point out, the number of compromise supporters may be even higher - personally, I am sure it is - because the Zelensky regime has stigmatized any appeal to diplomacy and negotiations as \"treason\" for so long. Many Ukrainians are virtually certain to be afraid to speak their mind on this issue.\n\nSecond, what exactly the compromise camp understands by compromise is bound to be diverse. This camp may still include quite a few citizens who harbor illusions about what kind of compromise is available at this point.\n\nThird, the current regime - which is de-facto authoritarian - is not answerable to society, at least not in a way that would make it easy to predict how shifts in the national mood translate into regime policies, or not.\n\nAnd yet: There is no doubt that there is a groundswell in favor of ending the war even at the cost of concessions. Add the clear evidence of Western Ukraine fatigue - even a growing readiness to cut Ukraine loose - and the facts that the Russian military is creating on the ground, and it becomes hard to see how this basal shift in the Ukrainian mood could not become an important factor of Ukrainian - and international - politics.",

        "title": "'Soldiers on the energy front' - Ukraine's workers in high-risk race to repair bombed power grid",
        "text": "Hundreds of millions of euro needed to fix infrastructure wrecked by Russian missile and drones\n\nRussia hit Ukraine with 4,000 bombs, missiles and drones last month, renewing its onslaught against its neighbour's energy grid with strikes that wrecked power stations and other infrastructure and left millions of people without heat, light and running water.\n\nIt will take well over a year and hundreds of millions of euro to fix all the damage and replace destroyed facilities, leaving energy firms racing to be ready for the freezing months of next winter, and their workers facing a daunting task knowing that a repeat attack could endanger them and reduce their vital repairs to rubble at any moment.\n\n\"This is probably the first time since the beginning of the full-scale war when the Russians have managed to destroy and damage so many facilities in one or two attacks,\" says Dmytro Sakharuk, executive director of Ukraine's biggest private energy firm, Dtek, which lost 80 per cent of its generating capacity in the March strikes.\n\nMoscow's military has repeatedly targeted Ukraine's power grid since launching its full invasion in February 2022, but the recent attacks were particularly intense and precise and may have exploited the country's lack of air defence ammunition at a time when Republicans have blocked US aid to the country for several months.\n\nIn the latest attacks on Wednesday night, Russia destroyed Kyiv's largest power plant, the Trypilska thermal power station 50km south of the city. The plant provided electricity to millions of people in Kyiv, Cherkasy and Zhytomyr regions. Ukraine's energy ministry also said two facilities in the south had been targeted in Russian strikes, causing power outages in two regions.\n\nThe recent Russian bombardment targeted thermal and hydroelectric power plants, crucial parts of the electricity distribution network and even solar facilities.\n\nFive of Dtek's six power stations were damaged or destroyed, depriving Ukraine of what Sakharuk describes as \"a lot\" of its overall electricity output. He will not be more specific, because energy production is a sensitive wartime subject that could affect the work of everything from hospitals to ammunition factories.\n\nReports say Dtek facilities meet about a quarter of Ukraine's energy needs. Three nuclear power plants on Kyiv-controlled territory supply most of the country's electricity, even as an atomic station in Zaporizhzhia - the biggest in Europe - remains under Russian occupation.\n\n\"The destruction was significant ... We still do not understand the scale of damage as many facilities are still in rubble and we can't reach them,\" Ukrainian energy minister Herman Halushchenko told Bloomberg. \"Today the situation is even more complicated, compared with last year, as we have lost a lot of hydropower production and have to conduct planned repairs of nuclear units.\"\n\nWith energy production and therefore sales sharply reduced, and amid a war-induced economic crisis in Ukraine, Dtek faces a battle to fund the repairs. It may also be hard to find manufacturers with the capacity to produce specialised hardware and Ukraine is asking other countries with ex-Soviet infrastructure to supply parts.\n\n\"The Russians hit equipment like turbines, transformers and generators ... some of which have very limited availability now. We used many spare parts doing repairs to prepare for last winter, when we managed to restore 10 units that had been damaged the previous winter. We spent almost $110 million (\u20ac102 million) on those repairs, and two-thirds of those restored units have now been destroyed,\" Sakharuk says.\n\n\"We estimate it will cost $300-$400 million to repair the damage done to our facilities ... Some units that can be repaired could be back on-line in nine months or a year. Others will take 18 months at least,\" he adds.\n\n\"We will not be in time for winter. It's just physically impossible. Maybe we could speed up if we put all possible resources in this direction, but we [as a country] are still too slow and bureaucratic... If your house is burning, you have to run very quickly, but in our case it's too slow.\"\n\nUkraine will need external help to finance the reconstruction and should look at reforming a long-standing system of large subsidies for all consumers, Sakharuk says.\n\n\"We have people and the ability to do it, plus we have experience from earlier in the war of repairing damaged equipment,\" he adds, noting that Dtek, with some 50,000 staff, is one of Ukraine's biggest employers and taxpayers.\n\nRussia's invasion has taken a heavy human toll on the company: four Dtek employees have been killed and 63 injured while at work, and 264 employees who joined the military have been killed and more than 750 wounded while serving. More than 60 are missing and 11 are in Russian captivity.\n\n\"The probability of being killed for someone working at a power station is much higher than for most people in Ukraine. It is very disciplined and responsible work, because energy is a vital resource. People who do this are like soldiers on the energy front,\" Sakharuk says.\n\n\"The job they do is crucial for the whole country. A lack of energy can undermine the country's ability to defend itself. That's why they keep going and keep risking their lives, because they know that if they stop, then who else will do it?\" he adds.\n\n\"The most difficult thing is to repair a power station and then see it attacked again. And to have to repair it again, knowing that another missile strike may come and destroy all your work yet again in a second. Psychologically, that is very tough.\"\n\nWhile Ukraine's energy workers - and others across many sectors - repair damage caused by Russia's invasion, Kyiv's top officials and diplomats are trying to secure more weapons from allies that will help shield rebuilt facilities from new attacks.\n\n\"The parallel strategy [alongside reconstruction] has to be putting more air defence in place,\" Sakharuk says. \"Air defence is key, because the task is not only to recover, restore or build new sites, but to protect them and save them from being destroyed again.\"",

        "title": "What would open warfare between Israel and Iran look like? How tit-for-tat retaliatory strikes could spiral into full-scale conflict involving Tehran's shady proxy forces and both sides trading long-range missile attacks",
        "text": "The outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas following the October 7 attacks rocked the already precarious security landscape in the Middle East and stoked fears that violence could spread throughout the region.\n\nNow that prospect seems more likely than ever, with the Islamic Republic vowing revenge on what it calls the 'evil Zionist regime' after a suspected IDF strike on Iran's consulate in Syria killed 13 people, including two Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds force generals.\n\nIran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei vowed retribution in the wake of the attack, to which Tel-Aviv - yet to take responsibility for the strike on Damascus - retorted swiftly.\n\nForeign minister Israel Katz declared bluntly: 'If Iran attacks from its territory, Israel will respond and attack in Iran' - the latest step in a venomous war of words that threatens to spill over.\n\nProfessor Gerald Steinberg, an expert in conflict management and founder of Jerusalem-based NGO Monitor, said a potential war between Iran and Israel would be both futile and devastating.\n\n'They are on the verge of a confrontation similar to the October 1962 Cuban missile crisis between Washington and Moscow. Both countries can do massive damage to the other, but neither can 'win',' he said.\n\nWyn Bowen, Professor of International Security at King's College London's Department of War Studies, told MailOnline that it is unlikely Iran will seek to directly attack targets on Israeli soil, lest it risk an uncontrollable military response from Israel and its chief ally, the US.\n\nBut he also cautioned 'the Iranian leadership is under significant pressure to respond robustly' to the consulate attack, suggesting that a direct conflict, albeit unlikely, must be considered.\n\nWith any major military escalation between the two arch enemies sure to subject citizens of both countries and their neighbours to yet more violence and misery, MailOnline breaks down Iran and Israel's military capabilities and assesses what a war between them could look like.\n\nA missile is launched during a military exercise in an undisclosed location in the south of Iran, in this handout image obtained on January 19, 2024\n\nThe rubble of a building annexed to the Iranian embassy is pictured a day after an air strike in Damascus on April 2, 2024\n\nIran warned arch foe Israel on April 2 that it will punish an air strike that killed seven Revolutionary Guards, two of them generals\n\nOnlookers check the car in which three sons of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh were reportedly killed in an Israeli air strike in al-Shati camp, west of Gaza City\n\nHow do Iran and Israel's militaries measure up?\n\nBoth states are vehemently opposed to one another and have scaled up their militaries with a view to ensuring their security in the event of an attack.\n\nAs such, Israeli and Iranian armed forces are well matched, but a few key discrepancies remain.\n\nIran enjoys a heavy advantage in terms of sheer manpower, boasting a collective active and reserve military of roughly 1.2 million troops as well as thousands upon thousands of artillery systems.\n\nIsrael meanwhile has around 750,000 active and military personnel at its disposal - but hundreds of thousands of these are already engaged in operations in and around Gaza, while others maintain a presence in the north to ward off border attacks from Hezbollah in Lebanon.\n\nThough Israel is outnumbered, it is by no means outgunned - the IDF boasts more than 3,000 tanks in its ranks, roughly double the number thought to be in service in Iran.\n\nBut in reality, these numbers bear little importance.\n\nFirstly, the territories are separated by several countries - Syria, Iraq, Jordan and Saudi Arabia - amounting to a distance of almost 600 miles as the crow flies border to border, and 979 miles to Tehran.\n\nThis geographical reality means that a land-based conflict is practically highly unlikely - and even if Iran were try and send troops via Iraq and Syria to approach Israel, they would be met with an immediate response from US forces.\n\nWith a naval battle also highly unlikely, any meaningful direct conflict is likely to take the form of aerial assaults by air forces, missiles and drones.\n\nThe Israeli Air Force (IAF) certainly has the upper hand over its adversary, flying the very best US-manufactured combat aircraft including the formidable F-35 stealth fighter-bomber, and F-15 and F-16 fighter jets specifically designed according to IAF requirements.\n\nIt is also believed to have more combat aircraft at its disposal, outstripping the Islamic Republic of Iran's Air Force (IRIAF) by more than 100 units.\n\nThe IRIAF has managed to pull together a wide variety of aircraft into a coherent force that encompasses older generation F-14 Tomcat fighters, Iranian manufactured jets based on the US F-4 and F-5 series jets, and an assortment of Russian and Chinese manufactured combat aircraft.\n\nIt has recently ordered a fleet of highly-capable Sukhoi Su-35 fighter jets from Moscow that would considerably bolster its capabilities, but these are yet to be delivered.\n\nHowever, Iran does have at its disposal a formidable array of missiles and highly capable drones - undoubtedly the most numerous and diverse in the Middle East - which could be used to deal punishing strikes on Israel.\n\nJustin Crump, British Army veteran and CEO of strategic intelligence company Sibylline, estimates Iran has no less than nine different missile systems at its disposal capable of delivering effective strikes on Israeli territory.\n\nA handout photo made available by the Iranian Army office on 19 January 2024 shows a missile being launched during a military drill in the Persian Gulf, southern Iran\n\nAn Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), the Shahed-136, is being displayed at the Azadi (Freedom) Square in western Tehran, Iran, on February 11, 2024\n\nhandout picture provided by the Iranian Army media office on January 19, 2024, shows the launch of a missile during a military drill at an undisclosed location in southern Iran\n\nWhat could a conflict between Iran and Israel look like?\n\nIran orders its proxies to step up attacks on Israel\n\nWith Iran and Israel neither willing nor able to send ground forces of their own to battle the other, the options for a conventional war are limited.\n\nBut Iran, while removed from Israel's border by hundreds of miles, has a series of well-armed, well-funded and ferocious proxy forces under its thumb besides Hamas that surround Israel on all sides.\n\nHezbollah, the political and military group in Lebanon - has in recent years emerged as a potent force in the Middle East, boasting a multifaceted arsenal and diverse military capabilities that pose a considerable threat to Israel.\n\nIn addition to the array of small arms, machine guns and hundreds of thousands of rockets at its disposal, Hezbollah boasts a range of anti-tank and anti-air systems, a fleet of thousands of drones, and dozens of tanks and armoured vehicles.\n\nHezbollah has already engaged in skirmishes with Israel along the border and both sides have exchanged intermittent missile and drone strikes.\n\nBut an express order from Tehran could see Hezbollah's leaders dramatically step up aggressive operations against Israel.\n\nAnd though Iran could not send troops of its own via Iraq and Syria to descend upon Israel, the Islamic Republic has huge numbers of loyal militias in both of those countries likely willing to fight on its behalf.\n\nKata'ib Hezbollah (KH) and its affiliates, also known as the Hezbollah Brigades, is a Shia militia that constitutes one of the largest members of the Popular Mobilisation Forces - an umbrella organisation made up of several armed groups in Iraq.\n\nAnd Iran's intervention in the Syrian Civil War played a pivotal role in supporting Bashar al-Assad's government throughout the conflict, with Tehran helping to create Syria's National Defence Forces (NDF).\n\nThe forces comprise tens of thousands of troops from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, who were largely trained and armed by the IRGC.\n\nAnd finally, the Houthi rebel movement in Yemen is also an Iranian-backed Shia group waging a bitter war against the Sunni Yemeni government.\n\nThe group is hundreds of thousands strong, is extremely well armed and proficient in the use of conventional arms, cruise and ballistic missiles, and drones.\n\nUnlike Hezbollah and Hamas, the Houthis do not count Israel as their biggest foe and do not share a border with the Jewish state.\n\nBut they have significant missile capabilities and have significantly impacted global trade thanks to a campaign of strikes and seaborne attacks on shipping vessels in the Red Sea following October 7.\n\nIf the Iranian leadership were to instruct elements of some or all of these forces to begin a consolidated attack on Israel, the IDF - already consumed with the war on Hamas in Gaza - would be severely stretched to defend its borders up and down the country.\n\nAnd coordinated missile strikes from these players would also occupy Israeli air defences - perhaps increasing the efficacy of a long-range missile strike from Iran itself.\n\nMeanwhile, attacking Israel via its proxies helps to insulate Iran from a potential US military engagement, which would threaten to destabilise the regime.\n\nEngaging via proxies allows Iran to exact a limited form of revenge without being directly implicated.\n\nTehran is the chief backer of both Hamas and Hezbollah - but these are just some of the powerful militias that have been propped up by Iranian money, weapons and military training in recent decades\n\nFighters from the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah\n\nHezbollah militants are seen standing alongside artillery weapons\n\nMembers of Iraq's Kata'ib Hezbollah paramilitary group\n\nProtestors lift Yemeni and Palestinian flags, Houthi anti-US and Israeli emblems, and guns during a rally marking International Jerusalem Day on April 5, 2024, in Sana'a, Yemen\n\nHouthi supporters hold up their rifles as they take part in a pro-Palestinian protest in Sanaa, Yemen February 18, 2024\n\nTit-for-tat strikes turn into long-range warfare\n\nThe strike on the Iranian consulate was a calculated risk - though it killed high-ranking Iranian generals, it did not occur within Iran's borders.\n\nIt is therefore reasonable to assume some kind of retaliation from Iran could see the regime strike an Israeli asset beyond Israeli borders, or perhaps a US asset given Washington's support of Israel.\n\nProfessor Bowen told MailOnline: 'Iranian action against Israeli interests outside of Israel is a more likely response.\n\n'An informative precedent for a direct attack from Iranian soil in retaliation to actions against senior Iranian officials operating in the region was its retaliation to the killing of Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the IRGC Quds Force, at Baghdad airport in January 2020.\n\n'A few days after the American drone operation ordered by President Donald Trump that killed Qassem Soleimani, over a dozen ballistic missiles were launched directly from Iranian soil against two military bases in Iraq where US forces were based. But this attack was not directly against targets in the US itself.'\n\nBut if Israel and Iran become embroiled in such a series of tit-for-tat strikes, the potential for a more explosive and direct conflict will only increase.\n\nIn that instance, direct missile attacks on Israeli territory are certainly the most effective and feasible way Iran could conduct warfare against the Jewish state.\n\nTel-Aviv enjoys the protection of a highly advanced air-defence network, including the world-renowned Iron Dome and David's Sling systems designed to defend against short, medium and long-range rockets and enemy aircraft.\n\nBut the systems are not impenetrable and could be overwhelmed by coordinated salvos of missiles.\n\nMeanwhile, a less devastating but more surgical and perhaps more deniable option for Tehran would be to utilise its fearsome army of kamikaze drones, most notably the Shahed-136 model which has been used to great effect by Vladimir Putin's forces to terrorise Ukrainian cities.\n\nIsrael's Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepts rockets launched from the Gaza Strip, amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, as seen from Ashkelon, Israel, January 15, 2024\n\nIron Dome air defence system fires to intercept a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip, in central Israel, Sunday, Nov. 5, 2023\n\nA handout picture provided by the Iranian Army media office on January 19, 2024, shows the launch of a missile during a military drill at an undisclosed location in southern Iran\n\nCyberattacks\n\nIn the absence of a conventional military confrontation, Iran may seek to step up its cyberattacks on Israeli infrastructure.\n\nThe two nations have traded cyberattacks intermittently for years, and Israel's cyber defence chief Gaby Portnoy warned that the quantity of such attacks against Israel has already tripled since the outbreak of the Hamas war on October 7.\n\nSpeaking at the 10th global Cybertech conference in Tel Aviv on Tuesday, Portnoy, head of the Israel National Cyber Directorate, said: 'Cyberattacks by Iran and Hezbollah in the region and beyond started around the clock against Israel' following October 7.\n\nBut Tal Pavel of the Israeli Institute for Cyber Policy Studies told the BBC that Tel-Aviv must expect an even sharper ramping up of hostilities in cyberspace.\n\n'We cannot rule out that perhaps Iran may use cyberspace as another dimension to take revenge on Israel, either to perform cyber-attacks on information technology, and to cripple, and to steal, and to leak information, or to try to distract at least operational technology,' he said.",

        "text": "Pyongyang: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un asserted that now is the time to be more prepared for war than ever due to unstable geopolitical situations surrounding his country, as he inspected a military university, according to state-controlled media KCNA on Thursday. This comes as Pyongyang's tensions with rivals South Korea and the US as on the rise as both countries continue to hold joint military drills, which North Korea sees as a rehearsal for invasion.\n\nKim gave field guidance on Wednesday at the Kim Jong Il University of Military and Politics, named after his father who died in 2011, which KCNA said is the \"highest seat of military education\" in the country. He told the university staff and students that \"if the enemy opts for a military confrontation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the DPRK will deal a death blow to the enemy without hesitation by mobilising all means in its possession\".\n\n\"Outlining the complicated international situation ... and the uncertain and unstable military and political situation around the DPRK, he said that now is the time to be more thoroughly prepared for a war than ever before,\" KCNA said.

        "text": "By Tom Balmforth\n\nKYIV (Reuters) -Russian missiles and drones destroyed a large electricity plant near Kyiv and hit power facilities in several regions on Thursday, officials said, ramping up pressure on the embattled energy system as Ukraine runs low on air defences.\n\nThe major attack more than two years since Russia's full-scale invasion completely destroyed the Trypilska coal-powered thermal power plant near the capital, a senior official at the company that runs the facility told Reuters.\n\nUnconfirmed footage shared on social media showed a fire raging at the large Soviet-era facility and black smoke belching out of it.\n\n\"We need air defence and other defence support, not eye-closing and long discussions,\" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on the Telegram messaging app, condemning the attacks as \"terror\".\n\nKyiv's appeals for urgent air defence supplies from the West have grown increasingly desperate since Russia renewed its long-range aerial assaults on the Ukrainian energy system last month.\n\nThe attacks, which hammered thermal and hydroelectric power plants, have sparked fears about the resilience of an energy system that was hobbled by a Russian air campaign in the war's first winter.\n\nUkraine's air force commander said air defences took down 18 of the incoming missiles and 39 drones. The attack used 82 missiles and drones in total, the military said.\n\nThe destroyed power plant outside Kyiv, a major power supplier for the Kyiv, Cherkasy and Zhytomyr regions, is the third and last facility owned by state-owned energy company Centrenergo.\n\n\"Everything is destroyed,\" Andriy Gota, head of the supervisory board of the company, said when asked about the situation at Centrenergo.\n\nThe Ukrenergo grid operator said its substations and power generating facilities had been damaged in attacks on the regions of Odesa, Kharkiv, Zaporizhzhia, Lviv and Kyiv.\n\nUkraine's largest private electricity company DTEK, which lost 80% of its generating capacity during Russia's March 22 and March 29 attacks, said Russia's attacks hit two of its power stations, inflicting serious damage.\n\nThe strikes also attacked two underground storage facilities where Ukraine stores natural gas, including some owned by foreign companies, energy company Naftogaz said. The facilities continued to operate, it added.\n\n\"The situation in Ukraine is dire; there is not a moment to lose,\" said U.S. ambassador Bridget Brink, adding that 10 missiles struck critical infrastructure in the Kharkiv area alone.\n\nThe region of Kharkiv, which borders Russia and already has long, rolling blackouts in place, was forced to cut electricity for 200,000 people, presidential aide Oleksiy Kuleba said.\n\nAIR DEFENCE PLEAS\n\nUkraine has warned it could run out of air defence munitions if Russia keeps up the intensity of its strikes and that it is already having to make difficult decisions about what to defend.\n\nThere has been a slowdown in vital Western assistance and a major U.S. aid package has been blocked by Republicans in Congress for many months, Ukraine has said.\n\nForeign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia's overnight attack used six ballistic missiles, which can hit targets within minutes and are much harder to shoot down. Kyiv says that is why it needs U.S.-made Patriot air defences.\n\n\"Ukraine remains the only country in the world facing ballistic strikes. There is currently no other place for 'Patriots' to be,\" Kuleba wrote on social media platform X.\n\n(Reporting by Pavel Polityuk, Anastasiia Malenko and Max Hunder; writing by Tom Balmforth; Editing by Sharon Singleton and Devika Syamnath)\n\nSign Up for Springs AM Update\n\nYour morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.\n\nSuccess!

        "text": "Palestinian Territories (AFP) - Israel was on alert Thursday after its arch foe Iran threatened reprisals over a strike in Syria this month that killed two Iranian generals, and as the war against Hamas ground on in Gaza.\n\nDays after Israel strengthened its air defences and paused leave for combat units, the United States also warned of the risk of an attack by Iran or its allied groups at a time when Middle East tensions have soared.\n\nIran is \"threatening to launch a significant attack on Israel,\" US President Joe Biden said Wednesday, pledging \"ironclad\" support for its top regional ally despite diplomatic tensions over Israel's military conduct in Gaza.\n\nIsrael was widely blamed for an April 1 attack that destroyed Iran's consulate building in Damascus and killed seven members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including two generals.\n\nIran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on Wednesday warned that Israel \"must be punished and will be punished\", days after one of his advisors had said that Israeli embassies are \"no longer safe\".\n\nIsraeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz swiftly replied to Khamenei on social media site X that \"if Iran attacks from its territory, Israel will respond and attack Iran\".\n\nBiden said later Wednesday that he had told Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu that \"our commitment to Israel's security against these threats from Iran and its proxies is ironclad\".\n\n\"Let me say it again -- ironclad. We're going to do all we can to protect Israel's security.\"\n\nThe Axios news site reported that US Central Command chief Michael Kurilla was set to visit Israel to discuss the situation with Defence Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\nGerman airline Lufthansa said it had suspended flights to and from Tehran, probably until Thursday, \"due to the current situation in the Middle East\".\n\nAnd Russia warned its citizens to refrain from travelling to Israel, Lebanon and the Palestinian territories.\n\nIsrael and the United States have long faced off against Iran and the so-called \"Axis of Resistance\" coalition of militant groups based in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen.\n\nThe Syria strike killed Iranian IRGC Brigadier General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who led the foreign operations wing the Quds Force in Syria and Lebanon.\n\nGaza truce talks\n\nRegional tensions have been stoked by the Gaza war which broke out after Hamas launched their October 7 attack against Israel, which left 1,170 people dead, mostly civilians, according to Israeli figures.\n\nPalestinian militants also took about 250 hostages, 129 of whom remain in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli army says are dead.\n\nIran has said it had no advance knowledge of the October 7 attack but has hailed the assault against its decades-old enemy.\n\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed at least 33,482 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run territory's health ministry.\n\nThe Israeli military reported overnight operations in central Gaza which had also involved its navy and air force \"to eliminate terrorist operatives\".\n\nMuch of the long blockaded territory has been reduced to a bomb-cratered wasteland of destroyed buildings with yet more bodies feared under the mountains of rubble.\n\nAn Israeli siege has deprived Gaza's 2.4 million people of most food, water, fuel, medicines and other basic supplies, the dire shortages only alleviate by sporadic aid deliveries.\n\nIsraeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz said on Wednesday that \"Hamas is defeated\" militarily but pledged to keep fighting \"what remains of it\" in the years to come.\n\nAn Israeli air strike on Wednesday killed three sons of Hamas's Qatar-based leader Ismail Haniyeh.\n\nHaniyeh's brother Nahed told AFP inside Gaza that their family are \"in the same situation\" as other Gazans.\n\n\"There is no difference between the sons of leaders and the sons of the people,\" he said.\n\nHaniyeh insisted that his sons' deaths would not influence the group's position in ongoing talks in Cairo on a possible temporary ceasefire and hostage release deal.\n\nThose talks, which started Sunday, have brought no signs of a breakthrough on a plan presented by US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators, which Hamas said it was studying.\n\nBiden said that \"it's now up to Hamas, they need to move on the proposal that's been made\".\n\n'Destabilising Middle East'\n\nWashington has also ramped up pressure on Netanyahu to agree to a truce, increase aid flows and abandon plans to invade the territory's far-southern city of Rafah.\n\nAbout 1.5 million civilians are sheltering in Rafah, the last Gazan city yet to face a ground incursion.\n\nBiden labelled Netanyahu's handling of the war a \"mistake\" in an interview broadcast on Tuesday.\n\nWashington's tougher line has brought some results, the US Agency for International Development said.\n\nRecent days had seen a \"sea change\" in aid deliveries, said USAID administrator Samantha Power, although she insisted Israel needs to do more.\n\nGallant promised Israel would \"flood Gaza with aid\", using a crossing point on its border with Gaza, streamlined checks and two new routes organised with Jordan.\n\nHe said they expected to hit 500 aid trucks entering Gaza a day, the average pre-war level.\n\nIsrael has faced a chorus of international criticism over its handling of the war.\n\nSpain is among several Western nations, including Ireland and Australia, to have suggested they would recognise a Palestinian state in the near future as a starting point for wider peace talks.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez warned that Israel's \"disproportionate response\" in Gaza risked \"destabilising the Middle East and, as a consequence, the entire world\".\n\nIsrael's foreign ministry slammed Ireland's new prime minister Simon Harris for not mentioning the hostages held in Gaza during a speech to parliament.\n\nThe ministry charged that \"after the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust... there are those in Ireland who persist on being on the wrong side of history\".",

The study observed a 2.5 times greater risk of death in women with non-metastatic breast cancer within 8-15 years.\n\nOverall, both depression and anxiety were found to negatively impact survival rates and reduce the quality of life for patients with breast cancer.\n\n\"There are still no universal methods for the screening of this mental health condition. It is likely that psychotherapy and antidepressant treatment may reduce the risk of psychological distress, but further research in this area is needed,\" said Ilgiz G Gataullin, Professor of the Department of Oncology, Radiology and Palliative Medicine of the Kazan State Medical Academy, Russia.IANS",

        "text": "The world has grown so desensitized to the offenses of Vladimir Putin's Russia that the visible signs of torture on Islamic State terrorist suspects in court for the recent attack in Moscow sparked little reaction. After all, why be surprised?\n\nThe Russian government is no stranger to accusations of torturing people in custody, and it has violated international law in many other ways, both before and since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It has struck civilian targets with reckless abandon following an unprovoked invasion of a sovereign state. It has stolen more than 19,000 children from their Ukrainian families and relocated them against their will to Russia or Russian-occupied territory. It likely assassinated Putin's biggest political opponent in prison recently.\n\nThe sheer number of offenses is staggering, but even so, Russia has previously sought to hide its crimes, deny them or defend them within the parameters of international law. Though it didn't go as far as the George W. Bush administration with its legal gymnastics to justify torturing terrorist suspects, Russia's prior actions gave a nod to a set of widely recognized international rules and norms.\n\nThat is the response of a bad actor that still believes accountability might apply, whether legally or in the court of public opinion. Intentionally distributing videos of agents of the Russian state committing violent acts of torture is not.\n\nThe behavior of the Russian government has worsened because Putin has no fear that he will suffer consequences. The general playbook of overwhelming his detractors with too many criminal acts is starting to gain ground internationally, while he succeeds in quashing opposition at home too.\n\nMore worrying, though, is that it isn't just Russia. Impunity is contagious. Russia led the charge in assassinating opponents on foreign soil, but today, there are credible allegations against India, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Rwanda for lethal attacks against perceived adversaries overseas. These aren't all pariah states. Three remain close partners of the United States and have incurred no real consequences for these offenses against human rights and national sovereignty.\n\nWhen the United States has chosen to call out offenders of international law and norms, it's been met with credible cries of hypocrisy and double standards. America does the international order no favors when it lambastes countries of the global south for not condemning Russia's crimes while blocking meaningful action by the United Nations Security Council against Israel's collective punishment of Gaza's civilians.\n\nIf America is unwilling or unable to cajole its friends to abide by a set of international standards, what hope do we have of reining in the bad acts of others?\n\nCall it the rules-based order, the liberal international order or a system of international law.

Poverty rates around the world declined dramatically. Democracy spread for decades.

It was never powerful enough to rein in an unwilling superpower, but it did help shape state behavior and kept the bulk of it within certain parameters or risk the consequences. States that wholly bucked the system, such as North Korea, merely remained exiles, outside the constraints or benefits of the world order. Other states' actions outside the norms could, and often did, garner a collective response.\n\nAs one example, as recently as 2012, even Russia and China voted in support of U.N. Security Council resolutions to condemn a military coup in Mali and authorize sanctions and a peacekeeping force. This used to be unremarkable, but unanimous actions like this simply don't happen anymore. A rash of military coups across the Sahel in recent years couldn't even muster a unanimous expression of concern.\n\nA bit like Santa Claus, the system's efficacy only ever extended as far as global belief in it did. During the Cold War, that global belief was grounded in the fragile cooperation of two competing superpowers. They allowed and fostered conflict where it suited them, but they still managed to prevent war between two nuclear powers.\n\nToday, I'm not confident our existing system can do even that. Countries big and small across the globe no longer believe in it. The United States, once the system's primary guarantor, appears no longer willing or able to play its part.\n\nIt can be easy to ignore the signs that our system of order is fraying, given how nebulous that order already was. But if that system continues to retreat, we will be left with only chaos -- the kind that agents of chaos, such as Putin's Russia, thrive on.\n\nIf the global community of states, such as it is, cannot manage to resuscitate the order we had, we ought to start looking hard for a better system to replace it.",

        "title": "'It's time to be ready for war': North Korea's Kim Jong Un as tensions with rivals escalate",
        "text": "Pyongyang: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un asserted that now is the time to be more prepared for war than ever due to unstable geopolitical situations surrounding his country, as he inspected a military university, according to state-controlled media KCNA on Thursday. This comes as Pyongyang's tensions with rivals South Korea and the US as on the rise as both countries continue to hold joint military drills, which North Korea sees as a rehearsal for invasion.\n\nKim gave field guidance on Wednesday at the Kim Jong Il University of Military and Politics, named after his father who died in 2011, which KCNA said is the \"highest seat of military education\" in the country. He told the university staff and students that \"if the enemy opts for a military confrontation with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), the DPRK will deal a death blow to the enemy without hesitation by mobilising all means in its possession\".\n\n\"Outlining the complicated international situation ... and the uncertain and unstable military and political situation around the DPRK, he said that now is the time to be more thoroughly prepared for a war than ever before,\" KCNA said. North Korea has stepped up weapons development in recent years under Kim and has forged closer military and political ties with Russia, allegedly aiding Moscow in its war with Ukraine in return for help with strategic military projects.\n\nNorth Korea has accused the United States and South Korea of provoking military tensions by conducting what it called \"war manoeuvres\" as the allies have conducted military drills with greater intensity and scale in recent months. Last week, Pyongyang said it had tested a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile powered with solid propellants, the latest in its series of weapons tests as part of nuclear war preparations against its neighbours and the United States.\n\nThe United States and South Korea have responded by expanding their combined training and trilateral drills involving Japan and sharpening their deterrence strategies built around strategic US assets. The countries have also warned that they would swiftly retaliate against any attack by North Korea as it ramps up its nuclear rhetoric, further flaring up tensions.\n\nLast week, hours after the launch of North Korea's missile, Seoul's Defense Ministry announced that South Korea, the United States and Japan conducted a combined aerial exercise above waters near Jeju island that involved at least one nuclear-capable US B-52 bomber. The US has been increasing its deployment of strategic assets to the region, also including aircraft carriers and missile-firing submarines, in a show of force against North Korea, in recent months.\n\nMoreover, South Korea has launched its second military spy satellite into space, days after North Korea reaffirmed its plan to launch multiple reconnaissance satellites this year. The Koreas each launched their first spy satellites last year - North Korea in November and South Korea in December -- amid heightened animosities. Under a contract with SpaceX, South Korea was to launch five spy satellites by 2025.\n\nNotably, Pyongyang has been testing hypersonic missiles to fly at the speed of sound since 2021 and these systems can pose a challenge to regional missile defense systems because of their speed and maneuverability if perfected. However, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff accused North Korea of exaggerating the flight performance of the missile launched last week, although acknowledging that the North's technologies were improving.\n\n\"Hypersonic missiles are weapons systems that are still being developed by advanced nations (the United States, China and Russia etc.) and they require highly difficult technologies,\" the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a text message to reporters. \"It's difficult to predict when they will be deployed operationally, but it's expected to take a considerable amount of time.\"\n\nLast month, North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles as part of its renewed weapons test, raising tensions after the conclusion of US-South Korean military drills. The launches were North Korea's first known missile testing activities in about a month. Experts predicted earlier that North Korea would extend its run of missile tests and intensify its warlike rhetoric ahead of the US presidential election in November to boost its leverage in future diplomacy.\n\n(with inputs from agencies)",

They allowed and fostered conflict where it suited them, but they still managed to prevent war between two nuclear powers.\n\nToday, I'm not confident our existing system can do even that. Countries big and small across the globe no longer believe in it. The United States, once the system's primary guarantor, appears no longer willing or able to play its part.\n\nIt can be easy to ignore the signs that our system of order is fraying, given how nebulous that order already was. But if that system continues to retreat, we will be left with only chaos -- the kind that agents of chaos, such as Putin's Russia, thrive on.\n\nIf the global community of states, such as it is, cannot manage to resuscitate the order we had, we ought to start looking hard for a better system to replace it.\n\nElizabeth Shackelford is the Magro Family Distinguished Visitor in International Affairs at Dartmouth College and a foreign affairs columnist for the Chicago Tribune.

        "title": "Islam: The Religion of Terror",
        "text": "Whenever there is a major terrorist attack in any area of the world, it is generally safe to assume that the attack has some connection to followers of the Islamic faith. In the past 20 years, we had several mass shooting events where the killer was not a Muslim. If there is more than one attacker, the odds instantly rise to nearly 100% that the killers are Islamic.\n\nWhen I read the news that 130 people had been killed in Moscow, I wondered if Ukraine had developed a new strategy. It was quickly shown that 11 of the attackers were members of an ISIS terrorist group. They have some beef with Putin because he killed many of their colleagues in the area of Syria and Turkey.\n\nA few hours after the Moscow event, a group called ISIS-K claimed responsibility for the attack in the Crocus Concert Hall. What has the world come to when you have a terrorist group proudly declaring responsibility for mass murder? In the past, terrorists didn't need to say, \"Yeah, we did it.\" Law enforcement would quickly determine the identity of the attackers.\n\nISIS-K posted a picture of the attackers only minutes before the shooting began, which clearly shows the same outfits on several of the terrorists that were arrested by Russian security forces in the Bryansk Region.\n\nDespite the ongoing war in Ukraine, Washington issued a statement of solidarity with Russia, as the death toll has risen to 140 killed. \"The United States strongly condemns yesterday's deadly terrorist attack in Moscow,\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. \"We condemn terrorism in all its forms and stand in solidarity with the people of Russia in grieving the loss of life from this horrific event.\"\n\nUK Chancellor of the Exchequer Jeremy Hunt made similar remarks. \"We know that they are creating a smokescreen of propaganda to defend an utterly evil invasion of Ukraine. But that doesn't mean that it's not a tragedy when innocent people lose their lives when you have horrible bombings,\" Hunt said.\n\nRussia has done its best to link Ukraine to the attack. Since all of the gunmen are from Tajikistan, Putin's lies cannot change reality. The US tried to warn Moscow that some kind of big Islamic terror attack was coming.\n\nSeveral days later, it's not all that clear what the attackers were hoping to accomplish by killing innocent people. One of the four men in a video claimed that he went on the killing spree after he was promised 500,000 rubles ($5,400).\n\nIt is doubtful that any of the terrorists realized what would happen to them once Russian authorities apprehended them. Various news outlets did not attempt to conceal that the attackers had been tortured. Several had black eyes, and one was seen being zapped by some type of electrical device.\n\nJust like all other terror attacks done in the name of Islam, this latest one will quickly fade from memory. It is seen as an act of Islamophobia to add up negative events that were motivated by the Muslim faith.\n\nHouthi rebels are firing rockets into the Red Sea at any ship that floats by. If the West had any common sense, it would ask the Houthis why they've been randomly attacking ships. We don't make this demand because the Houthis would say the Koran gives them the authority to fire at any vessels commanded by infidels.\n\nChristianity is the most blamed religion for the world's problems. Many atheists spend all their time attacking the Bible. Islamists often attack Christians by calling us crusaders. This is a grievance that goes back 1,000 years. We can easily point out the shortfall of Islam by saying, \"Remember what your people did last week.\"\n\nEvery few days, there is a church somewhere in the world that terrorists have attacked. It breaks my heart to learn that fellow believers have been killed because of their Christian faith. I'm confirmed by the reality that Satan hates Christianity because it is the one true way to God.\n\n\"And he called them to him and said to them in parables, 'How can Satan cast out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand'\" (Mark 3:23-25).",

The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the largest terrorist attack in Moscow in the last decade.\n\nAfter the incident, the prime minister's office told AFP that the Islamic State had threatened France and that the jihadist organization was also behind several assassination plots recently foiled in European countries, including France and Germany.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the Paris Saint-Germain football match against FC Barcelona took place in Paris under increased security measures after a threat from the Islamic State was received before the game.",

        "text": "Russia's Investigative Committee launched a criminal investigation into Ukraine's oil and gas company Burisma where Hunter Biden served on the board of directors for five years and accused \"senior officials of the United States and Nato countries\" of funding terrorism in Russia. / bne IntelliNews\n\nRussia's Investigative Committee launched a criminal investigation into the financing of terrorism in Russia on April 9, with focus on a board of directors that included the son of US President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden.\n\n\"Today, the Investigative Committee accused Joe Biden almost personally of financing terrorist attacks in Russia (but not yet specifically in Crocus), and through Ukraine,\" The Bell reported.\n\nThe Investigative Committee linked terrorism in Russia to \"senior officials of the United States and Nato countries,\" without specifically mentioning the Crocus City Hall attack on March 22 that left over 140 dead.\n\nA recent poll in Russia found that the majority of Russians believe that the attack on the mall by at least four gunmen from Tajikistan was organised by Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stringently denied being involved or masterminding the attack. As bne IntelliNews reported, there is much stronger evidence that the mastermind behind the attack was based in Turkey. A branch of Islamic State (IS) extremist group has claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThis Investigative Committee case has been brought under Article 205.1 of the Russian Criminal Code that deals with terrorism and claims that Hunter Biden-linked company Burisma was involved in funding terrorist operations aimed at destabilising Russia. The committee claims the company targeted key political and public figures as well as inflicting economic damage on Russia.\n\nThe inquiry into these allegations began after an appeal by Duma deputies and public figures, including prominent figures from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, United Russia, and proponents of \"Eurasianism.\" This group contends that Burisma's financial contributions, specifically an $18mn donation to the Ukrainian Armed Forces' \"Army of Drones\" project, constitute the financing of terrorism.\n\nDespite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Putin was quick to blame the \"Ukrainian direction\" in the attacks and has used the incident to bolster the Kremlin's propaganda campaign to drum up support for his war in Ukraine, which is now into its third year.\n\nBurisma has long been a subject of scrutiny after it hired Hunter Biden on a large salary. He served on the company's board from 2014 to 2019. His tenure has fuelled accusations of corruption and preferential treatment, though no concrete evidence has been presented to support claims of misconduct by the Bidens.\n\nWhen he was president, Donald Trump tried to pressure Zelenskiy into bringing charges against Hunter Biden, by leveraging promises of aid to Ukraine, for his own political advantage. Trump's first impeachment as president in 2019 was sparked by a phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy, in which Trump linked US military aid to Zelenskiy ordering a criminal investigation of the younger Biden.\n\nThe focus on Burisma and its alleged role in financing terrorism marks a significant escalation in the Kremlin's propaganda as Russia's authorities attempt to build a direct link between US officials and acts of terrorism within Russia. All of Russia was shocked by the attack in Crocus City Hall, the first serious terrorist incident in Russia in almost two decades.",

        "title": "Crude Recovers Early Losses on Warning of Possible Attack by Iran on Israeli Assets",
        "text": "Crude and gasoline prices Wednesday recovered from early losses and posted moderate gains after US intelligence said it believes a major missile or drone strike is imminent by Iran or its proxies against military and government targets in Israel. Iran has said it will launch some type of attack on Israeli assets as revenge for the recent Israel airstrike on Iran's consulate in Syria that killed some top Iranian military commanders. An escalation of hostilities in the Middle East could lead to the disruption of crude supplies from the region.\n\nCrude prices Wednesday initially moved lower, with crude falling to a 1-week low after the dollar index soared to a 4-3/4 month high. Also, today's slump in the S&P 500 to a 3-week low undercuts confidence in the economic outlook, which is bearish for energy demand and crude prices. In addition, Wednesday's weekly EIA crude inventories rose more than expected to a 9-month high.\n\nReduced crude demand in India, the world's third-largest crude consumer, is negative for oil prices after India's March oil demand fell -0.6% y/y to 21.09 MMT.\n\nCrude has support from the recent Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries that damaged several Russian oil processing facilities, limiting Russia's fuel exporting capacity. Russia's fuel exports in the week to April 7 fell by -450,000 bpd from the prior week to 3.39 million bpd. JPMorgan Chase said it sees 900,000 bpd of Russian refinery capacity that could be offline \"for several weeks if not months\" from the attacks, adding $4 a barrel of risk premium to oil prices.\n\nLast Friday's action by Saudi Arabia to raise oil prices more than expected is a supportive factor for crude. State-owned Saudi Aramco raised the price of its Arab Light crude to Asian customers for May delivery by +30 cents/bbl, above expectations of +10 cents/bbl.\n\nCrude prices have carryover support from last Wednesday when OPEC+, at its monthly meeting, did not recommend any changes to their existing crude output cuts, which kept about 2 million bpd of production cuts in place until the end of June. However, OPEC crude production in March rose +10,000 bpd to 26.860 million bpd, a bearish factor for oil prices as Iraq and UAE continue to pump above their production quotas.\n\nA decline in crude in floating storage is bullish for prices. Monday's weekly data from Vortexa showed that the amount of crude oil held worldwide on tankers that have been stationary for at least a week fell -17% w/w to 65.30 million bbl as of April 5.\n\nThe recent strength of Chinese crude oil demand is bullish for prices. Recent government data showed that China processed a record 118.76 MMT of crude in January and February, up +3% from the same time last year. Also, Chinese fuel demand jumped, with expressway passenger volumes 54% higher than 2019 levels, while airlines saw 19% more people than the pre-pandemic peak.\n\nCrude prices have underlying support from the Israel-Hamas war and concern that the war might spread to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Also, attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels have forced shippers to divert shipments around the southern tip of Africa instead of going through the Red Sea, disrupting global crude oil supplies.\n\nWednesday's weekly EIA report was mainly bearish for crude and its products. EIA crude inventories rose by +5.84 million bbl to a 9-month high, a much larger build than expectations of +800,000 bbl. Also, EIA gasoline supplies unexpectedly rose +715,000 bbl versus expectations of a -2.3 million bbl draw. In addition, EIA distillate stockpiles unexpectedly rose +1.66 million bbl versus expectations of a -1.38 million bbl draw. A slight positive for crude was the -170,000 bbl decline in crude supplies at Cushing, the delivery point of WTI futures.\n\nWednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of April 5 were -1.9% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -2.9% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -5.1% below the 5-year seasonal average. US crude oil production in the week ending April 5 was unchanged w/w at 13.1 million bpd, below the recent record high of 13.3 million bpd.\n\nBaker Hughes reported last Friday that active US oil rigs in the week ended April 5 rose by +2 rigs to 508 rigs, moderately above the 2-year low of 494 rigs posted on November 10. The number of US oil rigs has fallen over the past year from the 3-3/4 year high of 627 rigs posted in December 2022.\n\nMore Crude Oil News from Barchart\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Crude Slightly Lower After Large Build in EIA Crude Inventories",
        "text": "Crude and gasoline prices this morning are mildly lower, with crude falling to a 1-week low. Crude prices today gave up an early advance and turned lower after the dollar index soared to a 4-3/4 month high. Also, today's slump in the S&P 500 to a 3-week low undercuts confidence in the economic outlook, which is bearish for energy demand and crude prices. Crude oil maintained moderate losses after weekly EIA crude inventories rose more than expected to a 9-month high.\n\nCrude oil prices have support from Israel-Iran tensions as the markets wait to see whether Iran will launch some type of attack on Israeli assets as revenge for the recent Israel airstrike on Iran's consulate in Syria that killed some top Iranian military commanders.\n\nReduced crude demand in India, the world's third-largest crude consumer, is negative for oil prices after India's March oil demand fell -0.6% y/y to 21.09 MMT.\n\nCrude has support from the recent Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries that damaged several Russian oil processing facilities, limiting Russia's fuel exporting capacity. Russia's fuel exports in the week to April 7 fell by -450,000 bpd from the prior week to 3.39 million bpd. JPMorgan Chase said it sees 900,000 bpd of Russian refinery capacity that could be offline \"for several weeks if not months\" from the attacks, adding $4 a barrel of risk premium to oil prices.\n\nLast Friday's action by Saudi Arabia to raise oil prices more than expected is a supportive factor for crude. State-owned Saudi Aramco raised the price of its Arab Light crude to Asian customers for May delivery by +30 cents/bbl, above expectations of +10 cents/bbl.\n\nCrude prices have carryover support from last Wednesday when OPEC+, at its monthly meeting, did not recommend any changes to their existing crude output cuts, which kept about 2 million bpd of production cuts in place until the end of June. However, OPEC crude production in March rose +10,000 bpd to 26.860 million bpd, a bearish factor for oil prices as Iraq and UAE continue to pump above their production quotas.\n\nA decline in crude in floating storage is bullish for prices. Monday's weekly data from Vortexa showed that the amount of crude oil held worldwide on tankers that have been stationary for at least a week fell -17% w/w to 65.30 million bbl as of April 5.\n\nThe recent strength of Chinese crude oil demand is bullish for prices. Recent government data showed that China processed a record 118.76 MMT of crude in January and February, up +3% from the same time last year. Also, Chinese fuel demand jumped, with expressway passenger volumes 54% higher than 2019 levels, while airlines saw 19% more people than the pre-pandemic peak.\n\nCrude prices have underlying support from the Israel-Hamas war and concern that the war might spread to Hezollah in Lebanon. Also, attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels have forced shippers to divert shipments around the southern tip of Africa instead of going through the Red Sea, disrupting global crude oil supplies.\n\nToday's weekly EIA report is mainly bearish for crude and its products. EIA crude inventories rose by +5.84 million bbl to a 9-month high, a much larger build than expectations of +800,000 bbl. Also, EIA gasoline supplies unexpectedly rose +715,000 bbl versus expectations of a -2.3 million bbl draw. In addition, EIA distillate stockpiles unexpectedly rose +1.66 million bbl versus expectations of a -1.38 million bbl draw. A slight positive for crude was the -170,000 bbl decline in crude supplies at Cushing, the delivery point of WTI futures.\n\nToday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of April 5 were -1.9% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -2.9% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -5.1% below the 5-year seasonal average. US crude oil production in the week ending April 5 was unchanged w/w at 13.1 million bpd, below the recent record high of 13.3 million bpd.\n\nBaker Hughes reported last Friday that active US oil rigs in the week ended April 5 rose by +2 rigs to 508 rigs, moderately above the 2-year low of 494 rigs posted on November 10. The number of US oil rigs has fallen over the past year from the 3-3/4 year high of 627 rigs posted in December 2022.\n\nMore Crude Oil News from Barchart\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has stringently denied being involved or masterminding the attack. As bne IntelliNews reported, there is much stronger evidence that the mastermind behind the attack was based in Turkey. A branch of Islamic State (IS) extremist group has claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThis Investigative Committee case has been brought under Article 205.1 of the Russian Criminal Code that deals with terrorism and claims that Burisma was involved in funding terrorist operations aimed at destabilising Russia. The committee claims the company targeted key political and public figures as well as inflicting economic damage on Russia.\n\nThe inquiry into these allegations began after an appeal by Duma deputies and public figures, including prominent figures from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, United Russia, and proponents of \"Eurasianism.\" This group contends that Burisma's financial contributions, specifically an $18mn donation to the Ukrainian Armed Forces' \"Army of Drones\" project, constitute the financing of terrorism.\n\nDespite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, Putin was quick to blame the \"Ukrainian direction\" in the attacks and has used the incident to bolster the Kremlin's propaganda campaign to drum up support for his war in Ukraine, which is now into its third year.\n\nBurisma has long been a subject of scrutiny after it hired Hunter Biden on a large salary who served on the company's board from 2014 to 2019. His tenure has fuelled accusations of corruption and preferential treatment, though no concrete evidence has been presented to support claims of misconduct by the Bidens.\n\nWhen he was president, Donald Trump tried to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy into bringing charges against Hunter Biden, by leveraging promises of aid to Ukraine, for his own political advantage. Trump's first impeachment as president in 2019 was sparked by a phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy, in which Trump linked US military aid to Zelenskiy ordering a criminal investigation of the younger Biden.\n\nThe focus on Burisma and its alleged role in financing terrorism marks a significant escalation in the Kremlin's propaganda as Russia's authorities attempt to build a direct link between US officials and acts of terrorism within Russia. All of Russia was shocked by the attack in Crocus City Hall, the first serious terrorist incident in Russia in almost two decades.",

        "text": "{{ #verifyErrors }}{{ message }}{{ /verifyErrors }}{{ ^verifyErrors }}Something went wrong. Please try again later{{ /verifyErrors }}\n\nThe mother of Russia's most prominent opposition leader after Alexei Navalny says she lives in \"constant fear\" that her son, Vladimir Kara-Murza, will die in the Siberian prison in which he is currently jailed - while calling on the foreign secretary, David Cameron, to intervene and save his life.\n\nSpeaking on the eve of the second anniversary of Mr Kara-Murza's arrest, Elena Gordon said that her worries over her son have grown much more accute in the wake of the death of Vladimir Putin's most prominant critic, Mr Navalny, almost two months ago. Mr Navalny was also being held in a remote prison colony, in the Arctic, before he was declared dead by Russian authorities. Western leaders, including Lord Cameron, have lined up to say Putin is responsible for his death, while Navalny's widow has said that the Russian president killed her husband.\n\nMr Kara-Murza, 42, a British-Russian political activist and journalist, is serving a 25-year sentence in the IK-7 penal colony. He has faced solitary confinement for months, and was moved into a small punishment cell in January. The Kremlin has accused Kara-Murza of spreading \"false\" information about the Russian army in speaking out about Putin's invasion of Ukraine. It is the largest single sentence handed out to a Kremlin critic, including Mr Navalny, since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. In reality, the long-time Putin critic merely pointed out what the rest of the world could see: Russia's brutal assault on Ukraine.\n\n\"For over seven months now, my son has been held in solitary confinement in a high-security prison in Siberia. His health has deteriorated dramatically,\" Ms Gordon, who lived in England for years after moving from Moscow when her son was a teenager, said.\n\nMr Kara-Murza suffers from polyneuropathy, a nerve condition that affects his ability to feel his hands and feet. The only way it can be manage is by proper medical care and access to fresh air and walks. Such treatment is impossible in permanent solitary confinement. Ms Gordon said that she believes he will be left to die, or worse, killed and she \"lives in constant fear for my son's life\".\n\nIn a direct plea to the British government, Ms Gordon urged the foreign secretary, David Cameron to intervene. Two years to the day since his detention, the window to rescue him is closing, she said. Mr Kara-Murza's lawyer, Vadim Prokhorov, said that the medical staff at the Moscow prison where his client was previously held told him they believed Mr Kara-Murza could survive no more than three years in his current conditions of imprisonment. That was more than a year ago, and things have only got worse.\n\n\"In Soviet times, Western diplomatic pressure and public opinion had pulled Russian dissidents out of camps and saved their lives,\" Ms Gordon said. Today, just as fifty years ago, your action is required to save Vladimir Kara-Murza, so that he does not suffer the same brutal fate as Alexei Navalny.\n\n\"This is an urgent appeal: please help save my son Vladimir Kara-Murza,\" she added.\n\nLord Cameron met with Ms Gordon and Vladimir's wife, Evgenia Kara-Murza, last month to express his support. It was the first time a foreign secretary had actually met the jailed activists' family since his detention. Mr Navalny was buried in Moscow as the trio spoke in London, with images showing the critic's mother solemnly bent over his grave.\n\nThe meeting, which lasted nearly double the scheduled half an hour, was positive, according to Ms Kara-Murza. \"I think it went rather well,\" she said at the time. \"He assured me that the UK will be doing everything it can to bring Vladimir home.\"\n\nMr Kara-Murza's detention is just the latest in a string of Kremlin attempts to silence him. He has faced two assassination attempts on his life, first in 2015 and then in 2017, both of which his family believe to have been carried out by the Russian security service, the FSB. Now they fear this latest Kremlin tactic may just prove to be fatal - and are urging a prisoner swap deal.\n\n\"Let's be clear, his life sentence is a death penalty,\" the lawyer, Mr Prokhorov said. \"It is vital for the West to consider negotiating Vladimir's release. His future, his fate, must be the subject of special negotiations.\"\n\nDuring a meeting in Washington on Tuesday, Mr Kara-Murza's wife, Evgenia, told members of Congress that her husband was \"fighting not just for his freedom but truly for his life\". She renewed calls for US politicians to help of her husband.\n\nDemocrat Senator Ben Cardin, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, responded by saying that her husband's case would not be forgotten. \"We are going to work to set him free and to set Russia free,\" he said. Senator Jim Risch, the top Republican on the committee, called on US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken to designate Mr Kara-Murza as a \"wrongfully detained person,\" an appointment that would help elevate his case and provide resources to his family in America as they fight for his release.\n\nIn Westminster, Alicia Kearns, the chair of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee said that the \"British parliament, government and people\" are \"united in calling on Russia to release Vladimir and to halt the arbitrary detention of foreign nationals\".\n\n\"I know all of our thoughts are with Vladimir and his family as we approach this unhappy anniversary and I call on the government to redouble its efforts to get him home,\" she said.\n\nLabour shadow foreign minister David Lammy, also added to the calls for action. \"The government must do all it can to get Vladimir Kara Murza home and sound the alarm about what is happening,\" he said. \"That Vladimir Kara Murza, a British citizen, remains cruelly jailed by Vladimir Putin is further evidence Gulag-like imprisonment of dissidents has returned to Russia.\"\n\nBut it is unclear whether Lord Cameron will abandon the longstanding UK foreign policy not to negotiate with hostile regimes so as not to encourage future hostage-taking. Should Mr Lammy assume the role of foreign secretary after the next general election - with Labour well ahead in the current polls - it is unclear if he will seek to change the policy either.\n\nMr Prokhorov, meanwhile, said that the Western community, particularly the UK, must seriously think about dropping its current policy \"because the next victim after the assassination of Alexei Navalny is Vladimir Kara-Murza.\"\n\nHe said they should look into trading Soviet Union or Russian spies jailed in the UK and across the West for his client.\n\nFor Bill Browder, a close friend of Mr Kara-Murza and his family, and formerly the largest foreign investor in Russia before being forced out by the Kremlin, Britain's stance on helping Putin's political prisoners must be amended in line with its support against Putin's war in Ukraine.\n\nAt multiple stages in the more than two-year Russian invasion of Ukraine, the UK has overcome previous anxieties to send more offensive weapons to Kyiv, so it can not only defend itself, but ultimately push back Putin's forces. The same increased support should exist for backing Putin's jailed critics, he suggested.\n\n\"As we support the Ukrainians fighting back against Russia, we should spare some effort for the Russians who are fighting back against Putin,\" Mr Browder said. \"Among them, Vladimir Kara-Murza is perhaps the most important.\"",

He reminded that the United States had warned Russia about the possibility of a terrorist attack.\n\n\"This is nonsense. Russia knows that ISIS committed the terrorist attack in Moscow, we know that ISIS committed the terrorist attack in Moscow. We warned Russia about a possible terrorist attack in Moscow, everything else is noise,\" Sullivan emphasized.\n\nOn April 9, it was reported that the Russian Investigative Committee opened a criminal case on terrorist financing against the Ukrainian oil and gas company Burisma. It is the company that has allegedly paid for terrorist attacks in Russia in recent years, according to the committee.\n\nDeputies of the Russian State Duma claim that terrorist financing in Russia is carried out by \"high-ranking officials of the United States and NATO countries.\"\n\nInterestingly, the IC version denies the Kremlin's version of Ukraine's involvement in the events, as Burisma, according to them, financed the \"elimination of prominent political and public figures\" and not the shooting of Picnic fans.\n\nIt should be noted that Burisma remains the largest private gas producer in Ukraine. Its president and founder is former Minister of Ecology Mykola Zlochevskyi. After he fled Ukraine in 2014, the company created a board of directors, which included Hunter Biden, the son of the current US president.\n\nAs reported by OBOZ.UA:\n\n- Earlier, the White House said that despite the involvement of ISIS in the horrific terrorist attack near Moscow, the Kremlin is spreading disinformation. Russia is shifting the blame to Ukraine following Kremlin political narratives.\n\n- The White House also said that the U.S. Congress should act as soon as possible on a bill that would provide additional aid to Ukraine.

        "text": "FBI Director Christopher Wray Warns of Renewed Terrorist Threats and Foreign Adversary Interference in US Elections\n\nIn a stark warning delivered at an event in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, FBI Director Christopher Wray claimed that terrorist groups like ISIS and Al-Qaida have adopted \"mafia-like\" tactics as part of their plans to launch a new attack on the United States.\n\nSpeaking at the American Bar Association luncheon, Wray stated that \"foreign terrorists, including ISIS, al-Qaida and their adherents, have renewed calls for attacks against Jewish communities here in the United States and across the West in statements and propaganda.\" He added that the \"foreign terrorist threat and the potential for a coordinated attack here in the homeland, like the ISIS-K attack we saw at the Russian Concert Hall a couple of weeks ago, is now increasingly concerning.\"\n\nThe massacre Wray referenced took place at the Crocus City Hall in Russia, where 144 people were killed by Tajik nationals who were members of an Islamic State group, according to Russian security officials. The victims were waiting for a concert to start when the perpetrators set fire to the building.\n\nWray also warned that the recent Hamas assault on Israel on October 7th is likely to create \"a pipeline of radicalization and mobilization for years to come.\" The FBI director, who was appointed by former President Trump, named Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea as the biggest \"bad actors\" the US currently faces on the global stage.\n\nRegarding Russia, Wray alleged that the Kremlin is targeting \"underwater cables\" in an effort to destabilize worldwide communications. He stated that Russia \"doesn't care if their operations impact the lives of civilians\" and that since the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russian operatives \"continue to target critical infrastructure\" in the United States.\n\nWhen it comes to China, Wray said the country is more likely to \"play the long game,\" comparing their tactics to those of terrorist groups. He claimed that China has adopted \"mafia-like\" tactics, including a cyber attack division that outnumbers its US counterpart by a ratio of 50 to 1.\n\nWray's warnings extended to the upcoming US elections, where he said the country will face \"fast-moving threats\" enabled by advances in artificial intelligence and other technologies. He singled out generative AI, which he said has made it \"easier for both more and less-sophisticated foreign adversaries to engage in malign influence.\"\n\nThe FBI director emphasized that while officials have not cited successful efforts by foreign governments to directly alter election results, they have sounded the alarm over the past decade about foreign influence campaigns. Wray suggested the FBI would share information this year about the threats it sees, in order to \"usefully arm\" partners and the public against the types of foreign influence operations they are likely to confront.\n\nWray's remarks come amid escalating US government concerns over hard-to-detect influence operations designed to shape public opinion. In 2016, Russian operatives sought to boost Republican Donald Trump's election chances, while in 2020, Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized influence operations to denigrate Democrat Joe Biden and help Trump.\n\nChina \"considered but did not deploy\" influence operations in 2020, while Iran sought to exploit vulnerabilities in state election websites to hurt Trump's reelection chances, according to intelligence officials. Despite these threats, there was ultimately no evidence that any foreign entity changed votes or otherwise disrupted the voting process.\n\nAs the 2024 election cycle approaches, Wray's warnings underscore the ongoing challenges the US faces in safeguarding its democratic processes from foreign interference. The FBI director's call for increased vigilance and information-sharing aims to arm the public and partners against the evolving tactics of America's adversaries.",

Staff at the detention center did not allow the ombudsman representatives to take photographs of the bruises.\n\nRepresentatives of Kyrgyzstan's National Center for the Prevention of Torture also visited the detention center and filed complaints on behalf of the women.\n\nTemirov connected his wife's alleged beating with his investigative work. \"I consider it a warning sent to me through the beating of my wife in custody,\" he said, citing recent work on the family of President Sadyr Japarov and fact-checking of a claim by State Committee for National Security head Kamchybek Tashiev that Kyrgyzstan had recovered 100 billion som in its fight against corruption (Temirov says only 500,000 som has been returned to the Kyrgyz state).\n\nTemirov has had a long antagonistic relationship with the current Kyrgyz government given his sharp coverage of corruption issues. The battle between Bishkek and Temirov resulted in his deportation to Russia in November 2022, with the authorities claiming he'd illegally obtained Kyrgyz citizenship.\n\nTajibek kyzy, Temirov's wife and the director of Temirov Live and the Ait Ait Dese project, was detained during a January 16 sweep that targeted a number of journalists, many with connections to Temirov.\n\nUltimately, 11 journalists were detained in Bishkek, with the authorities citing alleged \"calls for mass unrest.\" Two of those initially detained were released to house arrest in mid-March - journalist Sapar Akunbekov and camera operator Akyl Orozbekov - while another, Jumabek Turdaliev, a former project manager, was released with a travel ban.\n\nOn April 9, four more detained journalists were released to house arrest - Tynystan Asypbek, Zoodar Buzumov, Saipidin Sultanaliev, and Maksat Tazhibek uulu.\n\nIn addition to Tajibek kyzy, Aktilek Kaparov, Aike Beyshekeeva, and Azamat Ishenbekov remain in detention.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reissued its call for Kyrgyz authorities to drop the charges against the journalists.\n\nGulnoza Said, CPJ's Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, said in a statement, \"While the release of another four journalists associated with Temirov Live is a step in the right direction, Kyrgyzstan continues to grossly flout its international free speech obligations by charging 11 journalists, four of whom are still being held, in retaliation for their reporting on official corruption.\"\n\nIn a related development, in early April the Kyrgyz State Committee for National Security (SCNS) reportedly suspended its criminal case against 24.kg, an outlet whose offices had been raided and sealed on January 15. At the time, the authorities alleged vague \"war propaganda\" charges against the outlet, which has subsequently changed hands.\n\nIn March, senior editor Makhinur Niyazova announced she was quitting, writing in a Facebook post, \"I don't want my name to even be mentioned next to that of the people into whose hands the news agency has passed.\"\n\n24.kg's founder Asel Otorbayeva posted her own statement denying that the outlet had been taken over and saying that the change in ownership was long-planned and not political.",

        "text": "FBI Director Christopher Wray (pictured) issued a stark warning at an event in Washington DC on Tuesday in which he claimed that ISIS and Al-Qaida have adopted 'mafia-like' tactics as part of plans to launch a new attack on the US. Wray was speaking at the American Bar Association luncheon when he made the warning while adding that the FBI is actively working to stop such attacks.\n\n'Foreign terrorists, including ISIS, al-Qaida and their adherents, have renewed calls for attacks against Jewish communities here in the United States and across the West in statements and propaganda,' Wray said, according to ABC News. 'The foreign terrorist threat and the potential for a coordinated attack here in the homeland, like the ISIS-K attack we saw at the Russian Concert Hall a couple of weeks ago, is now increasingly concerning.'\n\nThat massacre, which took place at the Crocus City Hall, saw 144 people killed by Tajik nationals who were members of an Islamic State group, security officials in Russia have said. The victims were waiting for a concert to start. Following the shooting, the perpetrators set fire to the building.\n\nWray added that thanks to Hamas ' brutal assault on Israel on October 7, there is likely to be 'a pipeline of radicalization and mobilization for years to come.'\n\nThe director, a Trump appointee, named Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, as the biggest 'bad actors' the US currently faces in the world. Wray also also alleged that Russia was targeting 'underwater cables' in order to destabilize worldwide communications. He added that the Kremlin doesn't care if their operations impact the lives of civilians and that since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, operatives 'continue to target critical infrastructure' in the US. Meanwhile, Wray said that China is more likely to 'play the long game.'\n\nHe compared China to terrorist groups saying that they too have adopted 'mafia-like' tactics with a cyber attack division that outnumbers its US counterparts 50 to one. When asked about a GOP proposal to cut the FBI's $500 million budget, he responded: 'China ain't cutting their budget.' Wray said that budget cutting would help 'violent criminals, the child predators, the Chinese government, cyber hackers and ransomware actors, the cartels and terrorists. It hurts our law enforcement partners, state local law enforcement partners who depend on us every day and all whole host of ways, and ultimately hurts the American people in the neighborhoods,' Wray went on.\n\nLast month, Wray said that the United States expects to face fast-moving threats to American elections this year as artificial intelligence and other technological advances have made interference and meddling easier than before. 'The U.S. has confronted foreign malign influence threats in the past,' Wray told a national security conference. 'But this election cycle, the U.S. will face more adversaries, moving at a faster pace, and enabled by new technology.' Wray singled out advances in generative AI, which he said had made it 'easier for both more and less-sophisticated foreign adversaries to engage in malign influence.'\n\nThe remarks underscored escalating U.S. government concerns over sometimes hard-to-detect influence operations that are designed to shape public opinion. Though officials have not cited successful efforts by foreign governments to directly alter election results, they have sounded the alarms over the past decade about foreign influence campaigns.\n\nWray suggested the FBI would share information this year about threats that it sees. 'As intelligence professionals, we've got to highlight threats in specific, evidence-based ways so that we're usefully arming our partners and, in particular, the public against the kinds of foreign influence operations they're likely to confront,' he said. In 2016, Russian operatives sought to boost Republican Donald Trump's election chances by stealing and leaking Democratic emails and by using a hidden but powerful social media campaign to sow discord among American voters.\n\nIn 2020, U.S. intelligence officials have said, Russian President Vladimir Putin authorized influence operations to denigrate Democrat Joe Biden and help Trump in that year's election. China 'considered but did not deploy' influence operations, while aggressive efforts by Iran sought to exploit vulnerabilities in state election websites as Tehran sought to hurt Trump's reelection chances, officials have said. Despite those threats, according to intelligence officials, there was ultimately no evidence that any foreign entity changed votes or otherwise disrupted the voting process.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

        "text": "Biden says Netanyahu's approach to the war is a mistake, deepening a rift between the two allies\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- U.S. President Joe Biden called Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the war in Gaza a mistake and called for his government to flood Gaza with aid, ramping up pressure on Israel to reach a cease-fire and widening a rift between the two staunch allies that has worsened as the war has dragged on.\n\nBiden has been an outspoken supporter of Israel's war against Hamas since the militant group launched a deadly assault on Oct. 7. But in recent weeks his patience with Netanyahu has appeared to be waning and his administration has taken a more stern line with Israel, rattling the countries' decades-old alliance and deepening Israel's international isolation over the war.\n\nThe most serious disagreement has been over Israel's plans for an offensive in the southernmost Gaza city of Rafah and the rift has spiraled since, worsened by an Israeli airstrike last week on an aid convoy, which killed seven workers with the food charity World Central Kitchen, most of them foreigners. Israel said the deaths were unintentional but Biden was outraged.\n\nBiden's comments, made in an interview that aired late Tuesday after being recorded two days after the WCK strike, highlight the differences between Israel and the U.S. over humanitarian aid to people in Gaza, where a monthslong war has led to warnings of imminent famine.\n\n\"What he's doing is a mistake. I don't agree with his approach,\" Biden told Spanish-language broadcaster Univision.\n\nIsrael threatens to strike Iran directly if Iran launches attack from its territory\n\nJERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's foreign minister threatened Wednesday that its country's forces would strike Iran directly if the Islamic Republic launched an attack from its territory against Israel, as tensions between the rival powers flare following the killings of Iranian generals in a blast at the Iranian consulate in Syria.\n\n\"If Iran attacks from its territory, Israel will respond and attack in Iran,\" Israel Katz said in a post on X in both Farsi and Hebrew.\n\nThe remarks came after Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reiterated early Wednesday a promise to retaliate against Israel over the attack on its consulate in Damascus earlier this month.\n\nTehran holds Israel responsible for the strike that leveled the building, killing 12 people. Israel has not acknowledged its involvement, though it has been bracing for an Iranian response to the attack, a significant escalation in their long-running shadow war.\n\nKhamenei spoke at a prayer ceremony celebrating the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, saying the airstrike was \"wrongdoing\" and akin to an attack on Iranian territory.\n\nWhat to know about the Arizona Supreme Court ruling that reinstates an 1864 near-total abortion ban\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Supreme Court has delivered a landmark decision in giving the go-ahead to enforce a long-dormant law that bans nearly all abortions, drastically altering the legal landscape within the state around terminating pregnancies.\n\nThe law predating Arizona's statehood provides no exceptions for rape or incest and allows abortions only if the mother's life is in jeopardy. Arizona's highest court suggested doctors can be prosecuted under the 1864 law, though the opinion written by the court's majority didn't explicitly say that.\n\nThe Tuesday decision threw out an earlier lower-court decision that concluded doctors couldn't be charged for performing abortions in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe law was enacted decades before Arizona became a state on Feb. 14, 1912. A court in Tucson had blocked its enforcement shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe decision in June 2022, then-Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, successfully requested that a state judge lift an injunction that blocked enforcement of the 1864 ban.\n\nTrack and field introducing prize money at Olympics with Paris gold medalists to get $50,000\n\nMONACO (AP) -- Track and field is set to become the first sport to introduce prize money at the Olympics, with World Athletics saying Wednesday it would pay $50,000 to gold medalists in Paris.\n\nThe governing body of athletics said it was setting aside $2.4 million to pay the gold medalists across the 48 events on the track and field program for this year's Paris Olympics. Relay teams will split the $50,000 between their members. Payments for silver and bronze medalists are planned to start from the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\n\"While it is impossible to put a marketable value on winning an Olympic medal, or on the commitment and focus it takes to even represent your country at an Olympic Games, I think it is important we start somewhere and make sure some of the revenues generated by our athletes at the Olympic Games are directly returned to those who make the Games the global spectacle that it is,\" World Athletics President Sebastian Coe said in a statement.\n\nThe prize money will come out of the share of Olympic revenue that that the IOC distributes to World Athletics and other governing bodies of individual sports.\n\nAthletes will have to pass \"the usual anti-doping procedures\" at the event before they receive the money, World Athletics added.\n\nMuslims worldwide celebrate Eid al-Fitr, but the festivities are marred by the war in Gaza\n\nJAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Muslims around the world celebrated the Eid al-Fitr holiday Wednesday, marking the end of the Islamic holy month with family reunions, new clothes and sweet treats.\n\nBut the celebrations were overshadowed by the worsening humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and Israel's expected offensive in the city of Rafah despite efforts from its Western allies to halt the fighting after six months of war.\n\nIn Istanbul, thousands of worshippers gathered at the Aya Sofya Mosque for morning Eid prayers, some carrying Palestinian flags and chanting slogans in support of people in Gaza.\n\nMany laid their prayer rugs in the square in front of the former Byzantine cathedral, which was re-converted to a mosque four years ago, as space inside quickly filled.\n\nIn a holiday message, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sent support to Gaza, which he called a \"bleeding wound on the conscience of humanity.\"\n\nBiden to honor PM Kishida, reflect on Japan's growing clout on international stage\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is set to host Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Wednesday for talks on the delicate security situation in the Pacific and a glitzy state dinner, honoring a leader who has proven to be one of Biden's strongest allies in the face of a string of international crises.\n\nKishida's official visit completes the administration's feting of the leaders of the Quad, the informal partnership between the U.S., Japan, Australia and India that the White House has focused on elevating since Biden took office. As Biden administration officials put it, they saved the most pivotal relationship for last.\n\nThe visit will mark the realization of Japan's transformation from regional player to that of global influencer -- with senior Biden administration officials noting appreciatively there is little the U.S. does across the globe that Tokyo doesn't support.

Arizona's highest court suggested doctors can be prosecuted under the 1864 law, though the opinion written by the court's majority didn't explicitly say that.\n\nThe Tuesday decision threw out an earlier lower-court decision that concluded doctors couldn't be charged for performing abortions in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe law was enacted decades before Arizona became a state on Feb. 14, 1912.

Israel has not acknowledged its involvement, though it has been bracing for an Iranian response to the attack, a significant escalation in their long-running shadow war.\n\nKhamenei spoke at a prayer ceremony celebrating the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, saying the airstrike was \"wrongdoing\" and akin to an attack on Iranian territory.\n\n___\n\nWhat to know about the Arizona Supreme Court ruling that reinstates an 1864 near-total abortion ban\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Supreme Court has delivered a landmark decision in giving the go-ahead to enforce a long-dormant law that bans nearly all abortions, drastically altering the legal landscape within the state around terminating pregnancies.\n\nThe law predating Arizona's statehood provides no exceptions for rape or incest and allows abortions only if the mother's life is in jeopardy. Arizona's highest court suggested doctors can be prosecuted under the 1864 law, though the opinion written by the court's majority didn't explicitly say that.\n\nThe Tuesday decision threw out an earlier lower-court decision that concluded doctors couldn't be charged for performing abortions in the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe law was enacted decades before Arizona became a state on Feb. 14, 1912. A court in Tucson had blocked its enforcement shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court issued its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe decision in June 2022, then-Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, successfully requested that a state judge lift an injunction that blocked enforcement of the 1864 ban.\n\n___\n\nTrack and field introducing prize money at Olympics with Paris gold medalists to get $50,000\n\nMONACO (AP) -- Track and field is set to become the first sport to introduce prize money at the Olympics, with World Athletics saying Wednesday it would pay $50,000 to gold medalists in Paris.\n\nThe governing body of athletics said it was setting aside $2.4 million to pay the gold medalists across the 48 events on the track and field program for this year's Paris Olympics. Relay teams will split the $50,000 between their members. Payments for silver and bronze medalists are planned to start from the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.\n\n\"While it is impossible to put a marketable value on winning an Olympic medal, or on the commitment and focus it takes to even represent your country at an Olympic Games, I think it is important we start somewhere and make sure some of the revenues generated by our athletes at the Olympic Games are directly returned to those who make the Games the global spectacle that it is,\" World Athletics President Sebastian Coe said in a statement.\n\nThe prize money will come out of the share of Olympic revenue that that the IOC distributes to World Athletics and other governing bodies of individual sports.\n\nAthletes will have to pass \"the usual anti-doping procedures\" at the event before they receive the money, World Athletics added.\n\n___\n\nMuslims worldwide celebrate Eid al-Fitr, but the festivities are marred by the war in Gaza\n\nJAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Muslims around the world celebrated the Eid al-Fitr holiday Wednesday, marking the end of the Islamic holy month with family reunions, new clothes and sweet treats.\n\nBut the celebrations were overshadowed by the worsening humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and Israel's expected offensive in the city of Rafah despite efforts from its Western allies to halt the fighting after six months of war.\n\nIn Istanbul, thousands of worshippers gathered at the Aya Sofya Mosque for morning Eid prayers, some carrying Palestinian flags and chanting slogans in support of people in Gaza.\n\nMany laid their prayer rugs in the square in front of the former Byzantine cathedral, which was re-converted to a mosque four years ago, as space inside quickly filled.\n\nIn a holiday message, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sent support to Gaza, which he called a \"bleeding wound on the conscience of humanity.\"\n\n___\n\nBiden to honor PM Kishida, reflect on Japan's growing clout on international stage\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is set to host Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Wednesday for talks on the delicate security situation in the Pacific and a glitzy state dinner, honoring a leader who has proven to be one of Biden's strongest allies in the face of a string of international crises.\n\nKishida's official visit completes the administration's feting of the leaders of the Quad, the informal partnership between the U.S., Japan, Australia and India that the White House has focused on elevating since Biden took office. As Biden administration officials put it, they saved the most pivotal relationship for last.\n\nThe visit will mark the realization of Japan's transformation from regional player to that of global influencer -- with senior Biden administration officials noting appreciatively there is little the U.S. does across the globe that Tokyo doesn't support. They pointed to Japan's eagerness to take a leading role in trying to bolster Ukraine against Russia's invasion or the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\nBiden and Kishida are also kindred spirits as politicians, both confronting difficult political headwinds on the home front while trying to navigate increasingly complicated problems on the global stage. Like Biden, Kishida has been dogged by low approval ratings for much of his tenure.\n\nBiden's reelection effort has been shadowed by an American electorate anxious about inflation, unease among some Democrats over his handling of the Israel-Hamas war, and concerns about whether at 81 he's too old to serve another four years.\n\n___\n\nExit polls suggest a big win by South Korea's liberal opposition parties in parliamentary election\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Initial exit polls suggested South Korea's liberal opposition parties are expected to win a landslide victory in Wednesday's parliamentary election.\n\nThe joint exit polls by South Korea's three major TV stations - KBS, MBC and SBS - show the main opposition Democratic Party and its satellite party were forecast to win combined 183-197 seats in the 300-member National Assembly.\n\nThe polls suggested the ruling People Power Party and its satellite party were projected to win 85-100 seats.\n\nThe predictions, if confirmed, would deal a massive blow to conservative President Yoon Suk Yeol and make him a lame duck for his remaining three years in office.\n\nTHIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP's earlier story is below:\n\n___\n\nKey question before US reveals latest consumer prices: Is inflation cooling enough for the Fed?\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- An eagerly awaited report Wednesday on consumer prices will show whether inflation is still easing, a trend the Federal Reserve will weigh in deciding when and by how much -- or even whether -- to cut interest rates this year.\n\nThe March inflation figures are expected to show an ever-so-slight cooling of inflation, which might keep the Fed on track to cut its benchmark rate three times this year, starting as early as June. But with inflation data having come in higher than expected in January and February, a third elevated reading could scramble the Fed's plans and forestall some or all of those rate reductions.\n\nThe government's inflation reports have assumed an unusually high profile this year in both the financial markets and the presidential election. Chair Jerome Powell has made clear that the Fed needs \"greater confidence\" that inflation is steadily falling back to the central bank's 2% target before it can begin reducing borrowing costs.\n\nRepublican critics of President Joe Biden have sought to pin the blame for high prices on the president and use it as a cudgel to derail his re-election bid. Despite a healthy job market, a near-record-high stock market and a significant drop in inflation from its peak of 9.1%, many Americans blame Biden for the surge in consumer prices that began in 2021. Average prices are still far above where they stood before the pandemic.\n\nEarly this year, Wall Street traders had projected that the Fed would cut its key rate up to six or seven times in 2024. In March, Fed officials penciled in three cuts. But persistently high inflation readings in January and February -- along with signs that economic growth remains healthy -- have led several Fed officials to suggest that fewer rate cuts may occur this year.\n\n___\n\nBiden administration imposes first-ever national drinking water limits on toxic PFAS\n\nThe Biden administration on Wednesday finalized strict limits on certain so-called \"forever chemicals\" in drinking water that will require utilities to reduce them to the lowest level they can be reliably measured. Officials say this will reduce exposure for 100 million people and help prevent thousands of illnesses, including cancers.\n\nThe rule is the first national drinking water limit on toxic PFAS, or perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which are widespread and long lasting in the environment.\n\nHealth advocates praised the Environmental Protection Agency for not backing away from tough limits the agency proposed last year. But water utilities took issue with the rule, saying treatment systems are expensive to install and that customers will end up paying more for water.\n\nWater providers are entering a new era with significant additional health standards that the EPA says will make tap water safer for millions of consumers -- a Biden administration priority. The agency has also proposed forcing utilities to remove dangerous lead pipes.\n\nUtility groups warn the rules will cost tens of billions of dollars each and fall hardest on small communities with fewer resources. Legal challenges are sure to follow.\n\n___\n\nItaly opens new slander trial against Amanda Knox. She was exonerated 8 years ago in friend's murder\n\nFLORENCE, Italy (AP) -- A Florence appeals court on Wednesday opened a new slander trial against Amanda Knox based on a 2016 European Court of Human Rights decision that her rights were violated during a long night of questioning into the murder of her British roommate without a lawyer and official translator.\n\nItaly's highest Cassation Court in November threw out the slander conviction, the only remaining guilty verdict against Knox after the same court definitively threw out convictions for 21-year-old Meredith Kercher's 2007 murder against Knox and her former Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, eight years ago.\n\nThe slander charge stems from Knox's accusation against the Congolese owner of a bar where she worked part-time during an overnight interrogation in the Perugia police station. The accusation appeared in statements typed by police that Knox signed, but which have been ruled inadmissible in this trial by the high court.\n\nKnox, who was a 20-year-old student with rudimentary Italian-language ability who had recently arrived in Perugia, recanted the accusation in a four-page handwritten note in English penned the following afternoon, which is the only evidence that the court can rule on in the new trial, her lawyer said.\n\nDespite Knox's attempts at walking back the accusation, bar owner Patrick Lumumba was picked up for questioning and held for nearly two weeks. Lumumba, who has since left Italy, is joining the prosecution as a civil participant, as allowed by Italian law.",

        "title": "Americans are still not worried enough about the risk of world war",
        "text": "Being the guy who's always shouting about impending disaster is frustrating, thankless work. If nobody listens to you, and the disaster happens, you're a useless Cassandra. If nobody listens to you and the disaster luckily doesn't happen, you're viewed as a fool. If people do listen to you and they take action to successfully avert the disaster, a lot of people will still say that your warning was wrong and the precautions were unnecessary. The only way you'll ever come out looking smart is if the disaster does happen, and people heed your warning in time to mitigate its impact. At that point, you're Gandalf. But the problem with being Gandalf is that it involves a disaster actually happening, so it's not exactly something you should hope for.\n\nDespite this, I think it's our duty to warn the world of impending disaster if we think we see one coming.\n\nI've been worried about a major war between the U.S. and China since the late 2010s, when tensions started ratcheting up in the South China Sea. I wrote a post for Bloomberg in 2018 saying that the risk of war was being ignored. I felt like I was shouting into the void.\n\nSince the pandemic, and especially since the wars in Ukraine and Gaza erupted, those worries have gone mainstream. To give just one example, JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, probably the country's most important banker, believes that the world is entering a period of geopolitical danger unrivaled since World War 2:\n\nThe nation's most influential banker, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, told investors Monday that he continues to expect the U.S. economy to be resilient and grow this year. But he worries geopolitical events including the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, as well as U.S. political polarization, might be creating an environment that \"may very well be creating risks that could eclipse anything since World War II.\"\n\nThe comments came in an annual shareholder letter from Dimon...\n\n\"America's global leadership role is being challenged outside by other nations and inside by our polarized electorate,\" Dimon said. \"We need to find ways to put aside our differences and work in partnership with other Western nations in the name of democracy. During this time of great crises, uniting to protect our essential freedoms, including free enterprise, is paramount.\"\n\nHe is, of course, completely right.\n\nBut while Dimon's letter talks about the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, it leaves the big one unspoken: World War 3. If China and the U.S. go to war, it'll make what's happening now in East Europe and the Middle East look like child's play -- not just because the forces involved would be larger, but because the existing wars in East Europe and the Middle East would likely expand into regional wars as well.\n\nYou can bet that although he doesn't talk about it, Dimon is thinking about WW3, as are many others. As I see it, the mere fact that not many people are talking about the danger represents evidence that we're still not taking it seriously. And because Americans aren't talking about it, our country doesn't have the urgency required to do something about it. One of our great strengths as a nation has always been that we start shouting about problems before they become severe, giving us time to prepare. Right now we're not shouting, so we're not preparing.\n\nSo although I'm just an unimportant little economics blogger, I will do my best to shout about the likelihood of an onrushing catastrophe.\n\nLet's begin with a scary historical parallel.\n\nWhen Americans think of World War 2, we usually think of the roughly four years of the war that we participated in, from late 1941 through 1945. Those years were indeed the most climactic and destructive of the war, by far, but the war actually began earlier. In fact, although the official start date is September 1, 1939, it's easy to make an argument that the war began long before that.\n\nSome historians view WW1 and WW2 as one continuous war, but I don't think that really makes sense -- there was definitely a lull in global war deaths in the 1920s. On top of that, WW1 didn't really have an East Asian theater. So let's set that view aside.\n\nBut throughout the 1930s, there were a number of conflicts that led into World War 2, and eventually merged with that overall conflict, like tributaries emptying into a great river. Let's do a quick timeline of these.\n\nIn 1931-32, Japan seized Manchuria from China, an act that led inexorably to a wider war between the two powers. The Manchurian war and occupation also set Japan on a path toward militarism, bringing to power the regime that would ultimately prosecute WW2 itself.\n\nIn 1935-36, fascist Italy invaded and conquered Ethiopia. The League of Nations halfheartedly tried to stop the war and failed, leading to the League being discredited and the post-WW1 order being greatly weakened. That emboldened the fascist powers. Ethiopian resistance to Italian rule would eventually become a minor theater of WW2.\n\nFrom 1935 through 1939, Japan and the Soviet Union fought an undeclared border war, ultimately culminating in major battles in 1939, which the USSR won. That led to Japan seeking an alliance with Nazi Germany, and eventually led to the Soviets' entry into the war against Japan at the very end of WW2. (The realization that Japan couldn't defeat the Soviets and conquer Siberian oil fields also prompted Japan to try to take Southeast Asian oil instead, when it needed oil to prosecute its war against China; this led to Pearl Harbor and the Pacific War.)\n\nFrom 1936 through 1939, Nazi Germany, fascist Italy, and the Soviet Union fought each other in a proxy war: the Spanish Civil War. Units from all three powers officially or unofficially engaged in the fighting. When the Nationalists won, it emboldened the fascist powers even further.\n\nIn 1937, Japan invaded the remainder of China, in what's called the Second Sino-Japanese War. This became a major theater of World War 2, accounting for almost as many deaths as the Nazi invasion of the USSR. It also prompted Japan to go to war with Britain and the U.S., in order to seize the oil fields of Indonesia to support the invasion of China. (The fact that we don't count this as the start of WW2 seems like pure eurocentrism to me.)\n\nIn 1939, the Soviet Union invaded Finland in what's known as the Winter War, seizing some territory at great cost. This war would continue all the way through WW2 itself.\n\nSo there were no fewer than six wars in the 1930s that ended up feeding into World War 2 itself! But even after the war officially began with Hitler's invasion of Poland in September 1939, it was several years before the alliances settled into their final configuration and the fighting reached its peak.\n\nHitler's invasion of Poland was actually a joint invasion with the Soviet Union! Even as the Nazis attacked from the west, the Soviets attacked from the east and seized part of Poland, having agreed with the Nazis beforehand to divide the country up. So at that point, until Hitler betrayed Stalin and attacked in 1941, the Nazis and the Soviets looked more like partners than enemies, despite just having fought a proxy war against each other in Spain.\n\nBritain and France declared war on Germany after it invaded Poland, but for eight months, nothing really happened; this was called the Phoney War. That pause ended when Hitler invaded and conquered France and started bombing Britain in 1940. At that point WW2 was in full swing, but the violence was still fairly localized and fairly limited -- only about two hundred thousand people died in those campaigns, which sounds like a lot but was only about 0.3% of the war's total death toll.\n\nIt wasn't until 1941 that World War 2 became what we Americans remember it as. It was then that the Nazis attacked the Soviets and Japan attacked the U.S., bringing the world's two most powerful countries into the fray, raising casualties enormously, sealing the fate of the Axis, and creating the grand alliance that would form the basis of the postwar world order.\n\nSo if you were living at any point in 1931 through 1940, you would already be witnessing conflicts that would eventually turn into the bloodiest, most cataclysmic war that humanity has yet known -- but you might not realize it. You would be standing in the foothills of the Second World War, but unless you were able to make far-sighted predictions, you wouldn't know what horrors lurked in the near future.\n\nIn case the parallel isn't blindingly obvious, we might be standing in the foothills of World War 3 right now. If WW3 happens, future bloggers might list the wars in Ukraine and Gaza in a timeline like the one I just gave.\n\nOr we might not be in the foothills of WW3. I think there's still a good chance that we can avert a wider, more cataclysmic war, and instead have a protracted standoff -- Cold War 2 -- instead. But I'm not going to lie -- the outlook seems to be deteriorating. One big reason is that China appears to be ramping up its support for Russia.\n\nThe Ukraine War is a proxy war. This is not because Ukraine is a U.S. or European \"proxy\", in the sense that we tell the Ukrainians what to do. We do not. But the U.S. and Europe are contributing to Ukraine's defense in order to keep Russia bogged down, because we all know that if Ukraine falls, the Baltics, Moldova, and eventually Poland are likely to be next on Putin's menu.\n\nIn fact, although the U.S. has done a lot to help Ukraine, Europe as a whole has done even more:\n\nExpressed as a share of GDP, Europe has done even more, since Europe's GDP is smaller than that of the U.S. And since the U.S.' aid has been mostly military -- which is basically the U.S. paying its own defense contractors -- Europe's aid has been more of an economic sacrifice.\n\nOn top of that, Europe, not the U.S., is bearing the brunt of the Russian gas cutoff. Ukraine's fate is also much more important to Europe than to the U.S. Not only does Ukraine stand to join the EU if it survives, but if Ukraine falls, Putin will probably begin dismantling Europe. The U.S.' lesser degree of direct interest in the outcome of the conflict is probably one reason why Ukraine aid is now bogged down in America even as Europe's assistance ramps up.\n\nSo it makes sense to view the Ukraine War as a European proxy conflict against Russia. But what's more ominous is that it also makes an increasing amount of sense to view it as a Chinese proxy conflict against Europe.\n\nA little over a year ago, there were reports that China was sending lethal aid to Russia. Believing these reports, I concluded -- perhaps prematurely -- that China had gone \"all in\" on Russia's military effort. Some of the reports were later walked back, but the fact is, it's very hard to know how much China is doing to provide Russia with drones and such under the table. But now, a year later, there are multiple credible reports that China is ramping up aid in various forms.\n\nFor example, the U.S. is now claiming that China is providing Russia with both material aid and geospatial intelligence (i.e. telling Russia where Ukrainian units are so Russia can hit them):\n\nThe US is warning allies that China has stepped up its support for Russia, including by providing geospatial intelligence, to help Moscow in its war against Ukraine.\n\nAmid signs of continued military integration between the two nations, China has provided Russia with satellite imagery for military purposes, as well as microelectronics and machine tools for tanks, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nChina's support also includes optics, propellants to be used in missiles and increased space cooperation, one of the people said.\n\nPresident Joe Biden raised concerns with Xi Jinping during their call this week about China's support for the Russian defense industrial base, including machine tools, optics, nitrocellulose, microelectronics, and turbojet engines, White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said.\n\nThis is very similar to the aid that Europe and the U.S. are providing Ukraine. We also provide geospatial intelligence, as well as materiel and production assistance. If reports are correct -- and this time, they come from the U.S. government as well as from major news organizations -- then China is now playing the same role for Russia that Europe and the U.S. have been playing for Ukraine.\n\nIn other words, the Ukraine War now looks like a proxy war between China and Europe. Jens Stoltenberg, the Secretary General of NATO, definitely thinks this is the case:\n\nAn \"alliance of authoritarian powers\" is working more closely together against Western democracies, the head of Nato has warned...Jens Stoltenberg told the BBC that Russia, Iran, China and North Korea are increasingly aligned...[Stoltenberg said that] the world was now \"much more dangerous, much more unpredictable\" and \"much more violent\"...He said there is an \"authoritarian\" alliance giving each other practical support that is \"more and more aligned\"...The Nato chief explained: \"China is propping up the Russian war economy, delivering key parts to the defence industry, and in return, Moscow is mortgaging its future to Beijing.\"\n\nWhat does it mean that China is now engaged in a proxy war against Europe? Several things.\n\nFirst, it means U.S. influence over the conflict is a lot more limited than we like to think. Americans like to believe that we're still the hegemon we were in 1999 -- that we can just stretch out our mighty hand to stop any war, and that wars therefore continue only when we want them to. This is complete fantasy. Even if America never sends another penny, Europe will continue to support Ukraine, because for them the conflict is existential (even if the Germans don't quite realize it yet). In fact, Europe may eventually fight Russia directly -- Emmanuel Macron is already talking about this openly.\n\nAnd Vladimir Putin, emboldened by Chinese production and intelligence support, and having staked not only his legacy but his regime's entire reason for existence on the conquest of territory in East Europe, will have little reason to stop fighting no matter what the U.S. says. The U.S. could push Ukraine to cede land for peace, and it probably wouldn't matter, because Putin wants all of Ukraine, and then he wants other European countries too.\n\nChina, for its part, has mostly lobbed threats and bellicose rhetoric to Europe through its various propaganda proxies:\n\nIn other words, the Ukraine War is now a proxy war between major powers that is almost totally out of America's control. That is a bad sign for global stability.\n\nIn fact, U.S. actions to try to deter China from backing Russia might just end up widening the conflict. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is threatening to put sanctions on Chinese banks:\n\nThe United States is prepared to sanction Chinese banks and companies, as well as Beijing's leadership, if they assist Russia's armed forces with the invasion of Ukraine, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Monday...\n\nChina is \"entitled\" to have a relationship with Russia, she said, noting that much of the trade between the two countries is seen by the U.S. as nonproblematic. But the provision of military aid from Beijing to Moscow could trigger sanctions.\n\nOf course, the election of Trump later this year could forestall that, since Trump has expressed conciliatory sentiments toward Russia and has made some recent signs of wanting to accommodate China as well. But if Trump's America withdraws into isolationism -- or worse, collapses into civil conflict -- it will simply give a green light to the authoritarian powers to carry out more conquests, as the Axis was emboldened in the 1930s. The U.S. would eventually end up having to rush back in after the fact, like in WW2, or see itself relegated to the status of a fallen, friendless middle power.\n\nOf course, World War 3 will actually begin if and when the U.S. and China go to war. Almost everyone thinks this would happen if and when China attacks Taiwan, but in fact there are several other flashpoints that are just as scary and which many people seem to be overlooking.\n\nFirst, there's the South China Sea, where China has been pressing the Philippines to surrender its maritime territory with various \"gray zone\" bullying tactics. Ian Ellis has a good rundown of these:\n\nThe U.S. is a formal treaty ally of the Philippines, and has vowed to honor its commitments and defend its ally against potential threats.\n\nAnd then there's the ever-present background threat of North Korea, which some experts believe is seriously considering re-starting the Korean War. That would trigger a U.S. defense of South Korea, which in turn might bring in China, as it did in the 1950s.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning the China-India border. China has recently reiterated its claim to the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, calling it \"South Tibet\" and declaring that the area was part of China since ancient times. India has vigorously rejected this notion, of course. An India-China border war might not start World War 3, but the U.S. would definitely try to help India out against China, as we did in 2022.\n\nSo even as Europe and China become more deeply enmeshed in a proxy war, there are multiple flashpoints in Asia that could blossom into World War 3 any day now. Asia is an absolute tinderbox right now.\n\nA few Americans like Jamie Dimon are starting to wake up to all of this, but most Americans are not -- they're still focused on domestic conflict. As a result, America hasn't mustered the urgency necessary to resuscitate its desiccated defense-industrial base. China is engaging in a massive military buildup while the U.S. is lagging behind. This is from a report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies:\n\nThe U.S. defense industrial base...lacks the capacity, responsiveness, flexibility, and surge capability to meet the U.S. military's production needs as China ramps up defense industrial production. Unless there are urgent changes, the United States risks weakening deterrence and undermining its warfighting capabilities against China and other competitors. A significant part of the problem is that the U.S. defense ecosystem remains on a peacetime footing, despite a protracted war in Ukraine, an active war in the Middle East, and growing tensions in the Indo-Pacific in such areas as the Taiwan Strait and Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe United States faces several acute challenges.\n\nFirst, the Chinese defense industrial base is increasingly on a wartime footing and, in some areas, outpacing the U.S. defense industrial base...Chinese defense companies...are producing a growing quantity and quality of land, maritime, air, space, and other capabilities. China...is heavily investing in munitions and acquiring high-end weapons systems and equipment five to six times faster than the United States...China is now the world's largest shipbuilder and has a shipbuilding capacity that is roughly 230 times larger than the United States. One of China's large shipyards, such as Jiangnan Shipyard, has more capacity than all U.S. shipyards combined, according to U.S. Navy estimates.\n\nSecond, the U.S. defense industrial base continues to face a range of production challenges, including a lack of urgency in revitalizing the defense industrial ecosystem...[T]here is still a shortfall of munitions and other weapons systems for a protracted war in such areas as the Indo-Pacific. Supply chain challenges also remain serious, and today's workforce is inadequate to meet the demands of the defense industrial base.\n\n\"The Chinese defense industrial base is increasingly on a wartime footing.\" If that isn't a clear enough warning, I don't know what would be. You have now been warned!\n\nA whole lot of Americans need to be shouting these warnings to anyone who will listen. Instead, many Americans seem intent on covering up the problems out of embarrassment:\n\nAs the Navy's largest U.S. trade show gets underway on Monday, officers in charge of the service's marquee shipbuilding programs won't offer the usual briefings with reporters and analysts about them...That break from the tradition...comes just days after the Navy announced that four of its most critical shipbuilding programs are years behind schedule...\n\nThe Navy's top admiral and civilian secretary have still not responded to questions about a damning Navy report released Tuesday outlining the sweeping failure of the Navy and its industrial partners to make expected progress on two submarine programs, an aircraft carrier and a new class of frigates...\n\nThe delays, from one to three years each depending on the program, come as the Navy and Pentagon pour billions into modernizing and upgrading shipyards in an attempt to build and repair ships more quickly and keep pace with China. Beijing's navy has already surpassed the U.S. in size.\n\nBut supply chain issues caused by Covid and the Navy's insistence on changing the design of its ships even as workers build them have thrown the service's plans into uncertainty.\n\nAware of the issues for years, the Navy is still unsure how to fix them...\n\nTwo people familiar with the issue say Navy leaders instructed the program managers not to hold their public briefings because the conference came too close to the release of the shipbuilding study[.]\n\nI'm sure that to someone in the Navy's public relations department thinks that simply refusing to talk to reporters about these problems means that the problems have been solved. This is typical of the ostrich-like mentality that I see among a very wide variety of Americans, from Congressional staffers to tech moguls to news reporters and pundits, regarding the imminent threat of war with China. But refusing to talk about problems doesn't make them go away; it simply makes us less prepared to deal with them.\n\nChina's leaders, meanwhile, labor under no such comforting illusions. In addition to their massive military buildup, they are taking various other actions that might or might not entail purposeful preparation for war, but definitely have the effect of making China better-prepared should a war break out.\n\nFor example, China's dominance of the battery and electric vehicle industries helps insulates them against a potential blockade of their oil supplies through the Straits of Malacca.\n\nXi has also commanded the country to improve its food self-sufficiency; since the country was 94% self-sufficient in food back in 2000, this is probably not an impossible task. That will insulate China against any possible blockade of food imports in the event of a war.\n\nAs for finance, China has been stockpiling gold and urging trading partners to do more business in yuan. That should help neuter threats of financial sanctions, like the one Janet Yellen just issued.\n\nAgain, I don't know which of these measures represent purposeful preparation before the launching of a great-power war. But they all definitely make China better-prepared. Even as the U.S. tries its best to ignore its glaring inability to build ships and missiles and ammunition, China is shoring up its key weaknesses in fuel, food, and finance.\n\nAll of this should scare you a bit. It certainly scares me a lot. The possibility that revisionist great powers will launch a world war in order to overturn the global order is now a lot higher than it was a few years ago, and arguably even higher than one year ago. Americans need to be screaming our heads off about this, so that we can start planning for this disaster today, instead of allowing ourselves to wait and be blindsided by it. We need to be warning our friends, and telling them to warn their friends. We need to be talking about this on national TV, in the New York Times, on podcasts, and on whatever social media the CCP still doesn't control.\n\nRight now, what I mostly hear is a deafening, horrible silence.",

        "text": "Terrorists are using \"mafia-like tactics\" to plan \"coordinated attacks\" on the US, the FBI has chillingly warned.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray revealed in a speech on Tuesday that foreign adversaries and terrorist affiliate groups such as ISIS-K are operating in an \"increasingly concerning way.\" The agency is working to prevent a coordinated attack from terrorist groups following the Russia Concert Hall attack that killed at least 60 people and injured over 145 others, the FBI said.\n\n\"Foreign terrorists, including ISIS, al-Qaida, and their adherents, have renewed calls for attacks against Jewish communities here in the United States and across the West in statements and propaganda,\" Mr Wray said.\n\nREAD MORE: 'Model' prisoner executed on death row despite 72 correctional officers opposing\n\nISIS are planning attacks on the US, according to the FBI\n\n\"The foreign terrorist threat and the potential for a coordinated attack here in the homeland, like the ISIS-K attack we saw at the Russia Concert Hall a couple of weeks ago, is now increasingly concerning. Oct. 7 and the conflict that's followed will feed a pipeline of radicalisation and mobilisation for years to come.\"\n\nThe stark warning comes just weeks after experts said they predict ISIS will try to attack the US. Former top general Frank McKenzie has admitted the \"threat is growing\" from the Islamic terror group after ISIS-K took responsibility for a deadly attack in Russia.\n\nGunmen opened fire at Moscow's Crocus City Hall, which is one of the biggest shopping and entertainment complexes in Russia, last month and a huge blaze began after the shooting which engulfed the complex.\n\nFor all the latest news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US\n\nISIS released a statement later in the evening claiming their fighters \"attacked\" a \"big gathering for Christians in the Russian Moscow suburb\" injuring \"hundreds\" and causing \"major destruction.\" Russia's foreign ministry called the incident a \"terrorist attack.\"\n\nISIS claimed the horrific attack in Russia\n\nThe former general said last month the terror group, who also claimed responsibility for a mass bombing in Iran in January, should be believed when they say they want to attack the US. \"We should believe them when they say that. They're going to try to do it,\" McKenzie told ABC News' \"This Week\" co-anchor Martha Raddatz.\n\n\"I think the threat is growing. It began to grow as soon as we left Afghanistan, it took pressure off ISIS-K. So I think we should expect further attempts of this nature against the United States as well as our partners and other nations abroad,\" McKenzie said. \"I think this is inevitable.\"\n\nThe retired general said the US maintains a large enough military presence in Iraq and Syria to stop extremists there but he believes there should have been a small troop presence kept in Afghanistan - rather than withdrawing completely in August 2021.\n\nIt brought an end to America's longest war but President Biden was criticised for the decision as he previously pledged there would be an \"over-the-horizon capability\" to \"act quickly and decisively\" in Afghanistan, even from a distance.\n\nHowever, McKenzie refuted those claims and believes it is not possible. \"In Afghanistan, we have almost no ability to see into that country and almost no ability to strike into that country,\" he said of the conditions on the ground now which he claims helps the Islamic State and other militants.\n\n\"If you can keep pressure on them ... in their homeland and their base, it makes it hard for them to conduct these types of attacks,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, we no longer place that pressure on them, so they're free to gain strength, they're free to plan, they're free to coordinate.\"",

        "text": "\"It is reckless to claim that the attacks on the Zaporozhye nuclear power plant are not connected with the Kiev regime, but Western countries simply cannot admit the obvious fact,\" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told Sputnik.She said that as soon as the West realizes that the attacks on the Zaporozhye facility were carried out by the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the Western myth about Ukraine and Volodymyr Zelensky will fall apart.Zakharova pointed out that Western nations \"have created a monster with potential consequences that they are now reluctant to acknowledge,\" Zakharova said. \"They seem to be brainwashing themselves with talk about how dangerous incidents should not be repeated,\" she concluded. On Tuesday, Ukrainian forces carried out a kamikaze drone attack on the Zaporozhye plant, following a similar attack last Sunday that injured at least three plant employees.\"The global community must recognize and respond to an act of nuclear terrorism by the Kiev regime,\" Zakharova said, commenting on Sunday's strike.The Zaporozhye plant has been under constant Ukrainian shelling and drone attack for more than two years, since it fell into the hands of Russian forces during the ongoing special military operation. Russia has repeatedly warned the IAEA and Kiev's Western sponsors that the attacks threaten to trigger a nuclear crisis in the heart of Europe.",

        "title": "Unfriendly Fire Only Israel faces impossible standards for conducting war. by Bruce Thornton",
        "text": "Last week Israel mistakenly attacked with missiles a humanitarian convoy in Gaza, killing seven aid workers. As they have done for eight decades, Israel's international enemies and alleged friends across the world immediately started demonizing Israel and accusing the IDF of intentionally targeting the aid workers. Biden also suggested just that when he said, \"Even more tragically, this is not a standalone incident,\" adding that the war in Gaza \"has been one of the worst in recent memory in terms of how many aid workers have been killed.\"\n\nOf course, Biden claims as well that Israel's alleged callous indifference to the lives and well-being of civilians and aid workers \"is a major reason why distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza has been so difficult -- because Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers.\"\n\nSadly, such unjust reactions and mendacious slurs against Israel have been unexceptional for decades. And only Israel faces incessant criticism over the mistakes and miscalculations that are the tragic, eternal contingencies of war.\n\nIn every battlefield throughout history, fighters have had to face the \"fog of war\"-- the chaos, uncertainty, unforeseen consequences, mistaken intel, dubious tactics, mediocre leadership, faulty training and discipline, plus terror, panic, and a \"thousand shapes of death,\" as the Roman poet Vergil described the brutal sack of Troy. These all lead to inadvertently killing one's own troops or civilians.\n\nMoreover, these grim constants of armed combat are multiplied and intensified in unconventional guerilla wars, especially in the complex landscape of towns and cities, where terrorists like Hamas shelter, spring ambushes, hide explosives, store armaments, use civilians of every age and sex as human shields, and employ humanitarian aid vehicles and ambulances to transport killers.\n\nBut over the last century, these historical realities of war have come to be understood as residues from more primitive and savage times, anomalies that modernity fancies can be corrected and mitigated with international laws, multinational covenants, institutions like the Red Cross, self-defeating \"rules of engagement,\" diplomatic intervention, and the conversion of illiberal autocracies into liberal democracies that acknowledge universal human rights and humanitarian restraints on war-making.\n\nHence the Nato nations, especially the U.S. and Great Britain, are pressuring Israel to announce a cease-fire, even though Hamas had been clear that it's not interested, calculating that stopping Israel now, when it is close to finishing the job of destroying a genocidal enemy, is an escape hatch for their survival. Equally short-sighted and incoherent, Western nations are reviving the long-moribund \"two-state solution\" that the majority of Palestinian Arabs have serially rejected, not least because it is contrary to orthodox Islamic doctrine.\n\nAs Michel Calvo wrote for the Gatestone Institute, this long-held foreign policy received wisdom of the West was recently repeated by erstwhile twice ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk, who said it's \"the only way to create lasting peace among the Israelis, the Palestinians, and the Arab countries of the Middle East.\" In fact, Calvo points out, \"radical Islam does not tolerate the existence of a sovereign non-Islamic entity (such as Israel) on land that once was conquered by Muslims (dar al-Islam, 'abode of Islam'). As most Palestinians have been creditably straightforward about, there is no place for an Israeli state.\"\n\nMore despicable is Biden's suggestions that Israel had intentionally targeted the aid van, or \"has not done enough to protect aid workers\" and \"civilians.\" In fact, Israel's tactic and protocols focused on protecting non-combatants have led to a low civilian-to-terrorist deaths ratio unprecedented in the history of war, especially urban guerilla warfare.\n\nTake, for example, the IDF's two-week operation at the end of March against Hamas terrorists using the Shifa hospital as a redoubt. In a tweet, former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett (@naftalibennett) reported:\n\n- 6,000 civilians were evacuated by the IDF to keep them safe.\n\n- 200 Hamas terrorists were killed.\n\n- 500 Hamas terrorists have been captured.\n\n- *No civilian was killed*. Not one.\n\nSimilarly, claims by Israel's critics that it is fomenting a famine among Gazans, are, as Park MacDougald explains on The Scroll Substack.com, dubious. More telling, MacDougald writes, \"According to United Nations and Israeli numbers, Israel is already delivering twice the amount of food into Gaza than what the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) says is necessary to meet Gazan civilians' needs.\"\n\nMoreover, it's shamefully hypocritical for the West to slander Israel as peculiarly callous about civilian casualties, given its own track-record of lethal blunders during the \"war on terror\" military operations in the last few decades. Here's a list from the Elder of Zyon site:\n\n9,000 civilians were killed by the US-led coalition in Iraq between 2003-2005.\n\nIn July 2008, the US hit an Afghan wedding party, thinking they were a large number of terrorists. 47 Afghan civilians were killed including the bride. And in November, a similar airstrike at a wedding killed 37 civilians, mostly women and children.\n\nBetween 86 and 147 Afghan civilians were killed in another 2009 US airstrike.\n\nIn September 2012, a US drone shot at a truck in Yemen, killing 12 civilians, including three children and a pregnant woman.\n\nIn 2015, the US fired over 200 shells at a hospital building in Kunduz, Afghanistan, killing 42 patients and staff. Days later, it admitted the mistake, saying that it had intelligence that the Taliban were in the building.\n\nIn March 2017 , the US dropped a 500-pound bomb on a building where about 50 people were sheltering in ISIS-controlled Syria.\n\nIn 2018, the US Army shot a Hellfire missile at a mother and daughter in Somalia, and when one tried to flee, it hit them again, killing them.\n\nIn 2021, a US drone shot and killed 10 civilians in Kabul, including an aid worker and seven children. It wasn't a split second decision - they watched the vehicle for eight hours without considering that perhaps the people they were watching were innocent.\n\nLast May, the US announced the killing of an Al Qaeda leader - but the victim was really a 56-year old former bricklayer.\n\nAs recently as February of this year, US airstrikes in Iraq killed civilians. In nearly all of these cases, the US didn't admit their mistakes until weeks or months later, if ever, and only when pressured would they release any results of investigations.\n\nAnd as NRO's Jim Geraghty pointed out last week about the hypocrisy of Israel's Western critics, \"let's note that lots of people who can shrug their shoulders at Russia's egregious ongoing human-rights abuses in occupied Ukraine, or the Chinese government's concentration camps and attempted genocide of the Uyghurs, or any action by the mullahs in Iran, will get out in the streets and furiously denounce Israel. When the only country that stirs your ire in terms of human rights is the one with a Jewish star on its flag, the rest of us can conclude what really motivates you.\"\n\nThe point is not to demonize the U.S., as its enemies do, but to remind us of the tragic reality of all wars. Most friendly fire deaths and killings of civilians happen because \"someone had blundered,\" as Tennyson said in his poem about the suicidal charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimean War. And war is eternally subject to what Abraham Lincoln called the \"awful arithmetic\": that some people, including the innocent, die now so that more people don't die later.\n\nFinally, aside from the hypocrisy, Biden's implied moral equivalence between Israel and Hamas is despicable and morally idiotic. As a liberal democracy, Israel's government is accountable for its actions. So far, two officers have been dismissed for their actions during the strike, and three reprimanded; an independent investigation has been launched; and \"Israel's Prime Minister, President and Defense Minister have also apologized and announced steps to try to prevent it from happening again,\" the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIsrael also has opened the Eretz border crossing and Ashdod port, and has pledged to allow more aid for Gazans, despite the fact that most aid, as it has for decades, will be stolen by Hamas to feed its terrorist forces, build and repair military infrastructure, or sell to Gazans at inflated prices on the black market.\n\nNor, needless to say, has Hamas, let alone its patron Iran, ever apologized for its savage violence, rape, and mutilation of Israelis. Instead, it proudly publicizes its depredations with gruesome videos posted on the internet, and openly boasts of its intentions to repeat them until the Jews are annihilated.\n\nOur government's selective outrage and unjust double standards are a blot on this country's honor. And Biden's bullying and threatening of Israel--which seems to be working, as Israel has withdrawn most of its forces from Khan Yunis in southern Gaza--will join the dishonorable abandonments of Saigon, the Bay of Pigs Cuban freedom fighters, and our Afghan partners as the worst betrayals of allies in our history.",

        "text": "On 22nd March, a concert hall in Moscow saw the bloodiest attack Russia has ever witnessed in years. A few days following the fifth inauguration of Russian President Vladimir Putin, gunmen broke into the facility, leaving 140 people dead and 80 critically injured. The attack is similar to the APS massacre in Peshawar, Pakistan, where terrorists attacked an Army public school on December 16, 2014, killing one hundred and thirty-six children. It was the world's largest children's death toll from a single terrorist strike. This recent, terrible incident in Moscow, raises grave concerns about who is behind the attacks and who benefits the most from such crimes.\n\nThe attack was promptly attributed to the Islamic State. The Islamic State, or Daesh, group claimed the attack and said that it was the deadliest strike in European history. The terrorist organization has multiple branches, including one in South and Central Asia. Its headquarters are in Syria and Iraq.\n\nSince its formation in 2013, ISIS wreaked havoc throughout Asia. The group was merciless in its targeting of civilians and law enforcement, as seen by the massacre of Yazidi civilians in Iraq and the bombings of Beirut, Jakarta, and Sri Lanka. ISIS-K, a branch of ISIS that has conducted operations in Iran, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, surfaced later in 2015. It seems to try to separate itself from rival organizations by launching mass-casualty assaults, aggressive propaganda in various languages, and inciting violence against adversaries. In recent times, ISIS-K has directed its attention towards Afghanistan. It has executed devastating attacks at the Kabul airport, targeted Iranian military personnel, and most recently, attacked a Taliban bank in Kandahar.\n\nMoscow bombing could have been designed to highlight the difference between how ISIS-K battles Russia and how the Taliban collaborates with Russia.\n\nISIS has a longstanding animosity against Russia and Putin. These extremist groups have frequently posed a threat to Russia's security, with Daesh Khorasan previously bombing the St. Petersburg metro in 2017, killing 15 people. The recent Moscow attack by ISIS-K may have been motivated by a variety of reasons, including vengeance for the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. ISIS-K's grievances against Russia, like those of many other jihadist groups, include Russian support for Syria's Bashar al-Assad dictatorship, as well as Russian cooperation with Iran and other Middle Eastern states that Sunni jihadists consider adversaries. In the wake of Russia Russia-Ukraine war, Moscow is desperate to rebuild its workforce after losing millions in the Ukraine bloodbath so they have relaxed their visa policies. Because of the low visa requirements now, these migrants can travel and penetrate easily into countries like Russia and Turkey. This militant organization appears to have taken advantage of security flaws by prioritizing the recruitment of Central Asian immigrants.\n\nAccording to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), ISIS-K, like its parent organization (ISIS) seeks to establish a \"pure Islamic state,\" which the group defines as a \"global, transnational caliphate\" administered by Sharia law. It is strange that ISIS, although claiming to promote the cause of Islam, has never stopped Israeli attacks on innocent Palestinians\n\nWith ISIS-K now fighting the reigning Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which has relatively excellent connections with Russia, the Moscow bombing could have been designed to highlight the difference between how ISIS-K battles Russia, which oppresses Muslims, and how the Taliban collaborates with Russia.\n\nThe recent development in Russia-Afghan relations is very significant. Since ISIS-K is the common enemy of both the Taliban and Russia, the Taliban movement's designation as a terrorist group is being reconsidered by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan also hailed Moscow's decision and stated that it was crucial to foster confidence between the two nations. In the future, a military collaboration may be considered to combat these militant groups\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has promised to punish those responsible for the 'brutal terrorist act', claiming that four armed men who attempted to flee to Ukraine have been apprehended. He said that Russia is interested in the client of the assailants even if he is aware that Muslim radicals attacked Moscow. He questioned who was in Ukraine awaiting their arrival at the time of the attack and why the terrorists sought to flee.\n\nISIS is composed of fanatical Muslims, but their attacks appear to help the United States. The initial appearance of ISIS justified the US military engagement in the Middle East in the eyes of the American people. What remains to be answered Who genuinely gains from the atrocities committed by ISIS-K? While they are targeting Russia, Iran, and Afghanistan, their existence contributes to the US narrative of regional instability. Russia must conduct a transparent inquiry to identify any potential connections or intricacies that are hidden beneath the surface. The intentions behind these acts warrant a thorough and unbiased inquiry.",

        "text": "During a ministerial meeting on global hunger taking pace at UN Headquarters in New York, Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the number of severely food insecure people had doubled in just two years - from 135 million pre-pandemic to 276 million today, with more than half a million experiencing famine conditions - an increase of more than 500 per cent since 2016.\n\n\"These frightening figures are inextricably linked with conflict, as both cause, and effect,\" he said. \"If we do not feed people, we feed conflict\".\n\nHunger triggers\n\nThe climate emergency is another driver of global hunger he added, pointing out that 1.7 billion people have been affected by extreme weather and climate-related disasters over the past decade.\n\nMoreover, the COVID-induced economic shock has compounded food insecurity by reducing incomes and disrupting supply chains, leading to an uneven economic recovery. Access to financial markets has been restricted, with some developing States now on the brink of debt default.\n\nBetween them, Ukraine and Russia produce almost a third of the world's wheat and barley and half of its sunflower oil. Russia and Belarus are the world's number two and three producers of potash, a key ingredient of fertilizer.\n\nThe war threatens to tip \"tens of millions of people over the edge into food insecurity, followed by malnutrition, mass hunger and famine, in a crisis that could last for years,\" warned the UN chief.\n\n\"In the past year, global food prices have risen by nearly one-third, fertilizer by more than half, and oil prices by almost two-thirds\".\n\nDevastating societies\n\nMeanwhile, most developing countries lack the fiscal space to cushion the blow of these huge increases with many unable to borrow because markets are closed to them.\n\n\"If high fertilizer prices continue, today's crisis in grain and cooking oil could affect many other foods including rice, impacting billions of people in Asia and the Americas,\" he detailed.\n\nAdditionally, children are threatened by a lifetime of stunting; millions of women and children will become malnourished; girls will be pulled from school and forced to work or get married; and families will embark on dangerous journeys across continents, just to survive.\n\n\"High rates of hunger have a devastating impact on individuals, families, and societies,\" spelled out the UN chief.\n\n'Five urgent steps'\n\nHowever, if we act together, there is enough food for everyone, he said adding that \"ending hunger is within our reach\".\n\nThe Secretary-General then outlined five urgent steps to solve the short-term crisis and prevent long-term damage, beginning with reducing market pressure by increasing food supplies - with no restrictions on exports and surpluses available to those most in need.\n\n\"But let's be clear: there is no effective solution to the food crisis without reintegrating Ukraine's food production, as well as the food and fertilizer produced by Russia and Belarus, into world markets, despite the war\".\n\nSecondly, social protection systems must cover all in need with food, cash; and water, sanitation, nutrition, and livelihood support must be provided.\n\nFourth, governments must bolster agricultural production and invest in resilient food systems that protect smallholder food producers.\n\nAnd finally, humanitarian operations must be fully funded to prevent famine and reduce hunger.\n\nAct in solidarity\n\nIn closing, the UN chief said that the Global Crisis Response Group on food, energy and finance is tracking the impact of the crisis on vulnerable people, identifying and pushing for solutions.\n\n\"The food crisis has no respect for borders, and no country can overcome it alone,\" he said.\n\n\"Our only chance of lifting millions of people out of hunger is to act together, urgently and with solidarity\".\n\n'Goodwill' needed\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken chaired the meeting in which foreign ministers from approximately 30 regionally diverse countries discussed steps to address global food security, nutrition, and resilience.\n\nDescribing the current situation as the \"greatest global food insecurity crisis of our time,\" Mr. Blinken attributed the emergency to conflict, drought and natural disasters - made worse by Russia's war on Ukraine.\n\nAlthough hopeful, he said that \"there is still a way to go\" and that \"the complex security, economic and financial implications require goodwill on all sides\".\n\nTo address the global crisis, US Secretary announced $215 million in humanitarian aid.\n\nUrgent to open ports\n\nWorld Food Programme (WFP) chief David Beasley drew attention to a world \"too fragile\" from years of conflict, pandemic and climate threats.\n\nHe also noted that current funding deficits could impede food access by as many as four million people.\n\nAdditionally, the top WFP official pointed out that a \"failure to open the ports\" in and beyond Ukraine will force people to the brink of starvation.\n\nAlthough the \"silos are full,\" blockades and other impediments are rendering them inaccessible, Mr. Beasley said, urging governments to \"step up\" now\".",

        "text": "Last week Israel mistakenly attacked with missiles a humanitarian convoy in Gaza, killing seven aid workers. As they have done for eight decades, Israel's international enemies and alleged friends across the world immediately started demonizing Israel and accusing the IDF of intentionally targeting the aid workers. Biden also suggested just that when he said, \"Even more tragically, this is not a standalone incident,\" adding that the war in Gaza \"has been one of the worst in recent memory in terms of how many aid workers have been killed.\"\n\nOf course, Biden claims as well that Israel's alleged callous indifference to the lives and well-being of civilians and aid workers \"is a major reason why distributing humanitarian aid in Gaza has been so difficult -- because Israel has not done enough to protect aid workers.\"\n\nSadly, such unjust reactions and mendacious slurs against Israel have been unexceptional for decades. And only Israel faces incessant criticism over the mistakes and miscalculations that are the tragic, eternal contingencies of war.\n\nIn every battlefield throughout history, fighters have had to face the \"fog of war\"-- the chaos, uncertainty, unforeseen consequences, mistaken intel, dubious tactics, mediocre leadership, faulty training and discipline, plus terror, panic, and a \"thousand shapes of death,\" as the Roman poet Vergil described the brutal sack of Troy. These all lead to inadvertently killing one's own troops or civilians.\n\nMoreover, these grim constants of armed combat are multiplied and intensified in unconventional guerilla wars, especially in the complex landscape of towns and cities, where terrorists like Hamas shelter, spring ambushes, hide explosives, store armaments, use civilians of every age and sex as human shields, and employ humanitarian aid vehicles and ambulances to transport killers.\n\nBut over the last century, these historical realities of war have come to be understood as residues from more primitive and savage times, anomalies that modernity fancies can be corrected and mitigated with international laws, multinational covenants, institutions like the Red Cross, self-defeating \"rules of engagement,\" diplomatic intervention, and the conversion of illiberal autocracies into liberal democracies that acknowledge universal human rights and humanitarian restraints on war-making.\n\nHence the Nato nations, especially the U.S. and Great Britain, are pressuring Israel to announce a cease-fire, even though Hamas had been clear that it's not interested, calculating that stopping Israel now, when it is close to finishing the job of destroying a genocidal enemy, is an escape hatch for their survival. Equally short-sighted and incoherent, Western nations are reviving the long-moribund \"two-state solution\" that the majority of Palestinian Arabs have serially rejected, not least because it is contrary to orthodox Islamic doctrine.\n\nAs Michel Calvo wrote for the Gatestone Institute, this long-held foreign policy received wisdom of the West was recently repeated by erstwhile twice ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk, who said it's \"the only way to create lasting peace among the Israelis, the Palestinians, and the Arab countries of the Middle East.\" In fact, Calvo points out, \"radical Islam does not tolerate the existence of a sovereign non-Islamic entity (such as Israel) on land that once was conquered by Muslims (dar al-Islam, 'abode of Islam'). As most Palestinians have been creditably straightforward about, there is no place for an Israeli state.\"\n\nMore despicable is Biden's suggestions that Israel had intentionally targeted the aid van, or \"has not done enough to protect aid workers\" and \"civilians.\" In fact, Israel's tactic and protocols focused on protecting non-combatants have led to a low civilian-to-terrorist deaths ratio unprecedented in the history of war, especially urban guerilla warfare.\n\nTake, for example, the IDF's two-week operation at the end of March against Hamas terrorists using the Shifa hospital as a redoubt. In a tweet, former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett (@naftalibennett) reported:\n\n- 6,000 civilians were evacuated by the IDF to keep them safe.\n\n- 200 Hamas terrorists were killed.\n\n- 500 Hamas terrorists have been captured.\n\n- *No civilian was killed*. Not one.\n\nSimilarly, claims by Israel's critics that it is fomenting a famine among Gazans, are, as Park MacDougald explains on The Scroll Substack.com, dubious. More telling, MacDougald writes, \"According to United Nations and Israeli numbers, Israel is already delivering twice the amount of food into Gaza than what the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) says is necessary to meet Gazan civilians' needs.\"\n\nMoreover, it's shamefully hypocritical for the West to slander Israel as peculiarly callous about civilian casualties, given its own track-record of lethal blunders during the \"war on terror\" military operations in the last few decades. Here's a list from the Elder of Zyon site:\n\n9,000 civilians were killed by the US-led coalition in Iraq between 2003-2005.\n\nIn July 2008, the US hit an Afghan wedding party, thinking they were a large number of terrorists. 47 Afghan civilians were killed including the bride. And in November, a similar airstrike at a wedding killed 37 civilians, mostly women and children.\n\nBetween 86 and 147 Afghan civilians were killed in another 2009 US airstrike.\n\nIn September 2012, a US drone shot at a truck in Yemen, killing 12 civilians, including three children and a pregnant woman.\n\nIn 2015, the US fired over 200 shells at a hospital building in Kunduz, Afghanistan, killing 42 patients and staff. Days later, it admitted the mistake, saying that it had intelligence that the Taliban were in the building.\n\nIn March 2017 , the US dropped a 500-pound bomb on a building where about 50 people were sheltering in ISIS-controlled Syria.\n\nIn 2018, the US Army shot a Hellfire missile at a mother and daughter in Somalia, and when one tried to flee, it hit them again, killing them.\n\nIn 2021, a US drone shot and killed 10 civilians in Kabul, including an aid worker and seven children. It wasn't a split second decision - they watched the vehicle for eight hours without considering that perhaps the people they were watching were innocent.\n\nLast May, the US announced the killing of an Al Qaeda leader - but the victim was really a 56-year old former bricklayer.\n\nAs recently as February of this year, US airstrikes in Iraq killed civilians. In nearly all of these cases, the US didn't admit their mistakes until weeks or months later, if ever, and only when pressured would they release any results of investigations.\n\nAnd as NRO's Jim Geraghty pointed out last week about the hypocrisy of Israel's Western critics, \"let's note that lots of people who can shrug their shoulders at Russia's egregious ongoing human-rights abuses in occupied Ukraine, or the Chinese government's concentration camps and attempted genocide of the Uyghurs, or any action by the mullahs in Iran, will get out in the streets and furiously denounce Israel. When the only country that stirs your ire in terms of human rights is the one with a Jewish star on its flag, the rest of us can conclude what really motivates you.\"\n\nThe point is not to demonize the U.S., as its enemies do, but to remind us of the tragic reality of all wars. Most friendly fire deaths and killings of civilians happen because \"someone had blundered,\" as Tennyson said in his poem about the suicidal charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimean War. And war is eternally subject to what Abraham Lincoln called the \"awful arithmetic\": that some people, including the innocent, die now so that more people don't die later.\n\nFinally, aside from the hypocrisy, Biden's implied moral equivalence between Israel and Hamas is despicable and morally idiotic. As a liberal democracy, Israel's government is accountable for its actions. So far, two officers have been dismissed for their actions during the strike, and three reprimanded; an independent investigation has been launched; and \"Israel's Prime Minister, President and Defense Minister have also apologized and announced steps to try to prevent it from happening again,\" the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nIsrael also has opened the Eretz border crossing and Ashdod port, and has pledged to allow more aid for Gazans, despite the fact that most aid, as it has for decades, will be stolen by Hamas to feed its terrorist forces, build and repair military infrastructure, or sell to Gazans at inflated prices on the black market.\n\nNor, needless to say, has Hamas, let alone its patron Iran, ever apologized for its savage violence, rape, and mutilation of Israelis. Instead, it proudly publicizes its depredations with gruesome videos posted on the internet, and openly boasts of its intentions to repeat them until the Jews are annihilated.\n\nOur government's selective outrage and unjust double standards are a blot on this country's honor. And Biden's bullying and threatening of Israel--which seems to be working, as Israel has withdrawn most of its forces from Khan Yunis in southern Gaza--will join the dishonorable abandonments of Saigon, the Bay of Pigs Cuban freedom fighters, and our Afghan partners as the worst betrayals of allies in our history.",

        "text": "Crude and gasoline prices on Tuesday settled mixed. Weakness in equity markets Tuesday undercut confidence in the economic outlook, which was bearish for energy demand and crude prices. Also, an easing of geopolitical risks in the Middle East weighed on crude prices after a senior commander in Iran's Revolutionary Guard said Iran won't block the Strait of Hormuz amid rising tensions with Israel.\n\nLosses in crude Tuesday were limited, and gasoline prices rose after the dollar index fell to a 2-1/2 week low. Also, tensions remain high between Israel and Iran as the markets wait to see whether Iran will launch some type of attack on Israeli assets as revenge for the recent Israel airstrike on Iran's consulate in Syria that killed some top Iranian military commanders.\n\nReduced crude demand in India, the world's third-largest crude consumer, is negative for oil prices after India's March oil demand fell -0.6% y/y to 21.09 MMT.\n\nCrude has support from the recent Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries that damaged several Russian oil processing facilities, limiting Russia's fuel exporting capacity. Russia's fuel exports in the week to April 7 fell by -450,000 bpd from the prior week to 3.39 million bpd. JPMorgan Chase said it sees 900,000 bpd of Russian refinery capacity that could be offline \"for several weeks if not months\" from the attacks, adding $4 a barrel of risk premium to oil prices.\n\nLast Friday's action by Saudi Arabia to raise oil prices more than expected is a supportive factor for crude. State-owned Saudi Aramco raised the price of its Arab Light crude to Asian customers for May delivery by +30 cents/bbl, above expectations of +10 cents/bbl.\n\nCrude prices have carryover support from last Wednesday when OPEC+, at its monthly meeting, did not recommend any changes to their existing crude output cuts, which kept about 2 million bpd of production cuts in place until the end of June. However, OPEC crude production in March rose +10,000 bpd to 26.860 million bpd, a bearish factor for oil prices as Iraq and UAE continue to pump above their production quotas.\n\nA decline in crude in floating storage is bullish for prices. Monday's weekly data from Vortexa showed that the amount of crude oil held worldwide on tankers that have been stationary for at least a week fell -17% w/w to 65.30 million bbl as of April 5.\n\nThe recent strength of Chinese crude oil demand is bullish for prices. Recent government data showed that China processed a record 118.76 MMT of crude in January and February, up +3% from the same time last year. Also, Chinese fuel demand jumped, with expressway passenger volumes 54% higher than 2019 levels, while airlines saw 19% more people than the pre-pandemic peak.\n\nCrude prices have underlying support from the Israel-Hamas war and concern that all-out war might spread to Lebanon. Hezbollah and Israel have traded fire almost daily since the Israel-Hamas war erupted on October 7. Also, the US and UK have engaged in airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen in retaliation for Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels have forced shippers to divert shipments around the southern tip of Africa instead of going through the Red Sea, disrupting global crude oil supplies.\n\nThe consensus is that Wednesday's weekly EIA crude inventories climb by +800,000 bbl and gasoline supplies fall by -2.3 million bbl.\n\nLast Wednesday's EIA report showed that (1) US crude oil inventories as of March 29 were -2.9% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -2.9% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -6.7% below the 5-year seasonal average. US crude oil production in the week ending March 29 was unchanged w/w at 13.1 million bpd, below the recent record high of 13.3 million bpd.\n\nBaker Hughes reported last Friday that active US oil rigs in the week ended April 5 rose by +2 rigs to 508 rigs, moderately above the 2-year low of 494 rigs posted on November 10.

        "text": "Staunton, Apr. 5 - Since Vladimir Putin became Russian president in 2000, he has made countering terrorism a centerpiece of his agenda, but with each passing term in office, he has used anti-terrorist legislation and practice less to ward off terrorist attacks than to go after his political opponents, according to analysts who have followed his actions.\n\nThat is the conclusion the Meduza news agency draws on the basis of an analysis of exactly what paragraphs Russians have been charged with terrorism over the course of Putin's time in power (meduza.io/feature/2024/04/04/v-2022-m-v-rossii-osudili-za-terrorizm-v-40-raz-bolshe-lyudey-chem-v-gody-predshestvovavshie-vozvrascheniyu-putina-v-kreml-v-2012-m\n\nInitially, Russian officials brought charges against people who were thought to be involved in the activities of terrorist groups, but over time, Putin added new paragraphs that allowed the Russian state to charge people with terrorist because they supposedly advocated its use.\n\nAs a result, the number of people charged with terrorism has jumped by 40 times over Putin's time in office, and Moscow's much-ballyhooed \"struggle against terrorism has been transformed into an industry of repression\" against all those individuals and groups the Kremlin leader doesn't like.\n\nNot only does this evolving use of anti-terrorism legislation have the effect of lumping together all those who oppose Putin with terrorist groups, something that works to the benefit of those in power; but it also has the effect of meaning that Moscow is devoting less time to fighting genuine terrorism, with the horrific consequences seen at Crocus City Hall.",

        "title": "Rights court finds Russia abusing ethnic Georgians at borders of breakaway territories",
        "text": "Europe's human rights court ruled that Russia's occupation of two regions of Georgia and its subsequent border enforcement has led to systematic human rights abuses of ethnic Georgians.\n\n(CN) -- Europe's human rights court on Tuesday found Russia guilty of committing a wide range of crimes, including killings, while policing the boundaries of the breakaway Georgian territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.\n\nThe decision by the European Court of Human Rights came in one of several cases brought by Georgia over Russia's occupation of its two regions following a brief war in August 2008.\n\nIn its ruling, the Strasbourg-based court said the border incidents were \"sufficiently numerous and interconnected\" to conclude that Russia was allowing systematic violations to take place.\n\nSince the 2008 war, Russia-backed police and border guards have been accused of harassing, illegally arresting and detaining, beating, torturing and killing ethnic Georgians trying to cross or living along border areas.\n\nAfter invading Georgia, Moscow recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent states. The war in Georgia foreshadowed Moscow's move to seize Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine in 2014. In both Georgia and Ukraine, Moscow claimed it needed to protect Russian-speaking populations.\n\nThe Strasbourg court said Russia was violating the rights of ethnic Georgians by imposing restrictions on movement across the regions' boundaries and thus forcing people to use dangerous alternative routes.\n\nThe borders have been hardened with fences, barbed wire and guard towers and crossing is permitted only at official posts, the court said.\n\nBut obtaining documents to cross the borders can be difficult and many locals living along them find it inconvenient to travel to the crossing points, the court said.\n\n\"People had been deprived of land, which they used for farming, families had been separated and children had been forced to choose between learning in Russian or making long and perilous journeys to Georgian-controlled territory to attend school,\" the court said in a news release.\n\nThe court said seven ethnic Georgian residents of Abkhazia had died while trying to cross the boundary lines by alternative routes to collect their pension or medication from Georgian-controlled territory.\n\nIt received information about more than 2,800 cases of people getting arrested for \"illegally crossing\" the borders, the court said.\n\nVillagers in South Ossetia who rely on income from livestock and farming lost access to pastures without warning or compensation, the court said.\n\nFamilies on different sides of the boundary lines were forced to undertake long or covert journeys, the court said. In some cases, the boundaries left village cemeteries inaccessible and behind barbed wire, it added.\n\nIn Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the Russian language gradually replaced Georgian in schools and this compelled some children to cross the border at unofficial crossing points to go to school in Georgian-controlled territory. This resulted \"in their regularly being held or detained by Russian border guards,\" the court said.\n\n\"The overwhelming majority of the international community\" considers the Russia-installed borders illegal under international law. For its part, Georgia views the borders \"as the occupation line,\" the court said.\n\nBut it is doubtful the court ruling will have much effect because Russia withdrew from the court's jurisdiction after its parliament quit the Council of Europe and stopped recognizing the European Convention on Human Rights following its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Russia did not submit written observations in connection with Tuesday's ruling.\n\nIn April 2023, the court said it had jurisdiction over this case because the charges of border abuse took place before Russia ceased being a party to the convention on Sept. 16, 2022.\n\nEven before it quit the Strasbourg court, Moscow had largely stopped complying with the mounting number of rulings against it and largely quit paying fines ordered by the court.\n\nNonetheless, the court's trials looking into human rights violations in Russia and in other European countries with disturbing track records, such as Turkey, serve to bring attention to cases that are often rejected by domestic courts.",

        "text": "The Russian government has -- without any evidence whatsoever -- accused a Ukrainian energy company known for its ties to Hunter Biden of financing terrorist attacks.\n\nThe Investigative Committee announced the startling claim in a press release Tuesday, accusing Burisma Holdings -- where President Biden's son once worked -- of sponsoring terrorist attacks both \"inside Russia and beyond its borders.\" Although no mention was made of last month's deadly attack on Crocus City Hall, the news comes after Russian authorities earlier this week claimed the perpetrators of that attack were hired by figures in Ukraine and, rather dubiously, promised payment in Russian rubles.\n\nMoscow is also now suggesting that certain unnamed U.S. officials may have been involved in funneling money to Burisma to finance terrorism in Russia, perhaps hoping to spark a few new Hunter Biden-related conspiracy theories ahead of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe Investigative Committee claims it acted at the behest of a group of lawmakers who demanded an investigation into the U.S. and NATO countries financing terrorist attacks -- and cracked the case in just a few days -- as that appeal from lawmakers was prepared only in late March.\n\nInvestigators are now said to be probing the flows of \"several million U.S. dollars\" and \"the involvement of specific individuals from among government officials, and public and commercial organizations in Western countries.\"",

        "text": "The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), in the case of \"Georgia v. Russia,\" found Russia guilty of human rights violations during the process of \"borderization\" -- the establishment of the demarcation line in the Georgian-Ossetian conflict zone, initiated shortly after the 2008 war.\n\nGeorgia filed three additional complaints against Russia with the ECtHR. Additionally, the court received around 200 individual complaints against Georgia, Russia, or both states, related to the 2008 armed conflict or the borderization process.\n\n\u25cf The press release also states that borderization is one of the most painful legacies of the Georgian-Russian conflict of August 2008. Specifically, the Georgian government claimed that attempts to enter or leave Abkhazia or South Ossetia resulted in \"illegal crossing\" of administrative borders, leading to killings, detentions, imprisonment, or harsh treatment of individuals.\n\n\u25cf According to the press release, people had their land confiscated, which they used for agriculture, families were separated, and children were forced to choose between learning the Russian language or undertaking long and dangerous journeys to attend school in territory controlled by Georgia.\n\nThe ECtHR decision emphasized that there is sufficient evidence -- lists of victims, witness testimonies, media reports, and international materials -- to conclude that the alleged incidents were not isolated but rather numerous and interconnected, forming a pattern of violations. Furthermore, the apparent lack of effective investigation into the incidents and the failure to take comprehensive measures against all those involved demonstrate that the Russian authorities were officially tolerant of such practices.",
