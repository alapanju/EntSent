        "title": "'Toxic': Rishi Sunak on UK parliament thrown into chaos over Gaza ceasefire vote",
        "text": "\"This week Parliament sent a very dangerous signal that this type of intimidation is effective.\"\n\nLondon:\n\nBritish Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has warned of a growing toxic culture in politics amid reports that MPs face security threats over their intention to vote in the House of Commons in relation to the Israel-Gaza conflict.\n\nThe 43-year-old leader of British India issued a statement on Saturday condemning extremists for hijacking the country's street protests to glorify terrorism. The Sunday Times reported that three unnamed female MPs were subject to extra security measures amid fears for their safety.\n\n\"Prejudice and anti-Semitism surge since Hamas attacks on October 7 [2023] are unacceptable because they are un-British. Simply put, anti-Semitism is racism,\" Sunak said in a statement.\n\n\"Legitimate protests have been hijacked by extremists to promote and glorify terrorism, with verbal threats and physical attacks against elected representatives, and violent attacks and anti-Semitic tropes flooding our own parliamentary buildings,\" he said, referring to the Recent offensive projections targeting the Palace of Westminster.\n\n\"A very dangerous signal has been sent in Parliament this week that this kind of intimidation is effective. It is toxic to our society and politics and an affront to the freedoms and values we hold dear in the UK,\" he said of these scenes. The House of Commons was thrown into chaos last week over the Gaza ceasefire vote.\n\nWhile he did not mention the matter specifically, his intervention came immediately after ruling Conservative MP Lee Anderson claimed in an interview that London Mayor Sadiq Khan, of Pakistani origin, was controlled by \"Islamists\".\n\nOpposition parties demanded action over the comments, with Labor leader Keir Starmer branding them an \"outbreak of racism and Islamophobia\".\n\nStarmer said: \"Not only is this embarrassing for the Conservative Party, it is emboldening the worst elements in our politics.\"\n\nPreviously, former Home Secretary Suella Braverman published an article over the weekend claiming that Islamists and extremists were taking over all walks of life in the UK. The opposition party attacked it as \"extreme remarks\".\n\nBraverman, who was sacked by Sunak last year, responded to Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle saying he had selected certain amendments to motions related to the Gaza ceasefire to ensure all options were on the table on the table for MPs to vote. and protect the safety of members of Congress.\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times, British Security Secretary Tom Tugendhat has been working with the Home Office, police and parliamentary authorities to significantly increase the security of MPs. As part of the reforms, the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (RAVEC), which is responsible for the security of the royal family and senior politicians including the Prime Minister and Home Secretary, has stepped in to help assess threats to MPs.\n\nA senior security source said \"many MPs are shocked by the abuse they have faced\".\n\nIt is understood the congresswomen who needed extra security were given tight protection by private companies and provided with chauffeur-driven cars, which are usually only given to senior cabinet members and the leader of the opposition.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "(File) A Ukrainian police officer takes cover in front of a burning building in Avdiivka, Ukraine, on 17 March, 2023. AP\n\nAs the Russia-Ukraine war enters its third year, news from the front is missing from daily newspapers. Gaza has pushed Ukraine onto the back pages. Casualty figures in Ukraine are ignored, while those of Gaza grab attention. The UN Security Council no longer passes or even attempts to pass resolutions seeking peace in Ukraine or accusing Russia, while major powers veto those on the Israel-Hamas war including where Israel or Hamas is blamed for the conflict. Pictures of the destroyed town, Avdiivka, captured by Russian forces recently, are missing from social media sites, while damages to hospitals in Gaza are prominent. The world has learnt to ignore Ukraine.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, has assumed the role of a dictator, backed by the US and its allies, while Putin already was one. It is currently two dictators fighting for their own survival, while their people die. Vladimir Putin's popularity remains high, while Zelenskyy, desperate to stay relevant, attends every global event requesting for funds while turning a blind eye to the devastation of his country. The Ukrainian army is struggling to stay afloat, with mercenaries drying up, while the Wagner army, now backed by the Russian state, continues to hire them from third-world countries. Ukraine remains an expendable proxy for the West.\n\nThe Ukrainian army is compelled to pull people off the street and send them into the war zone with little training, while the Russians have employed approximately a third of their military power. Western powers are pumping Ukraine with weapons and ammunition while Iran and North Korea, alongside China, provide Russia with armaments and drones.\n\nSponsors of Ukraine are slowly pulling back, and funding fatigue setting in. The loss of Avdiivka is possibly because Ukraine faced shortfalls in arms and ammunition largely blocked by the US House of Representatives. The only gainers of the conflict are armament industries, garnering maximum funds allocated for Ukraine. With US funds slowly drying, pressure mounts on Europe to fill the gap, which it cannot.\n\nPeace talks are nowhere on the horizon as the war is directed not by Kyiv but by Washington and London, which determines what approach Zelenskyy should take. The grandiose plans of the west to bleed Russia economically, compelling its breakup and drawing it into a second Afghanistan have faltered.\n\nWashington led crippling sanctions on Moscow did dent the Russian economy but hit Europe equally. Large parts of the world refused to adhere to US sanctions on Moscow, India included. Exports of Russian oil and gas continue as before, enabling Russia to fund its campaign.\n\nA report published by the Finland-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in February this year mentioned that India has increased its purchase of Russian crude by 13 times, implying India is partially financing the Russian campaign. The belief that Ukraine will save Europe from Russia's future onslaught is not being bought by anyone anymore. The war is largely fought on Ukrainian soil with limited impact on Russian assets.\n\nMilitary lessons to be drawn from the war have been collated. Initially, it was believed that the age of tanks had passed but that was wrong. Armoured warfare would continue albeit with changes in tactics, structure and redesigning of tanks. However, what came to the fore was the innovative employment of drones, UAVs, loitering munitions, long range artillery, missiles and other instruments of non-contact warfare. Cheap drones can now destroy equipment costing hundreds of millions of dollars. These will dominate future conflicts.\n\nBoth sides had the opportunity to test their counters against these weapons. It also signalled the end of short, intense conflicts. Finally, if a nation has allies, war-like stores would always be available, even if the domestic military industry lacks production capability, especially as most weapon systems are of a common calibre.\n\nWhat has been most pronounced is the huge loss of lives on both sides, hundreds of thousands. Ukraine has lost a generation. This could all have been avoided had the west opened its eyes post the Russian annexation of Crimea and also heeded its warnings on the expansion of NATO. However, these were ignored, setting the stage for the current conflict.\n\nTalks pushed by Turkey for a ceasefire were dumped at the last minute under directions from the west which hoped to draw Russia into a deeper war. For major powers, it is their long-term goals which count, loss of lives implies nothing. The fact that this is being repeated in Gaza on the pretext of ensuring the destruction of Hamas is another issue.\n\nYes, a major benefit of the war was that Europe's eyes opened and nations began investing in enhancing their military capabilities. Russia achieved what Trump had attempted in his first presidency and failed, which was increasing Europe's spending on defence. For Russia, Finland and Sweden have moved from being neutral to NATO members, bringing NATO to its doorstep. Just what it had sought to avoid, has happened.\n\nRebuilding Ukraine would cost trillions of dollars as would Gaza. While Gaza may be funded by the oil-rich Middle East, possibly with conditions, who would fund Ukraine. Neither Europe nor the US can pump unlimited taxpayers' funds into its reconstruction. Ukraine has been pushed decades behind in development.\n\nRussian military aims have been achieved while those of Ukraine and the west remain. Putin is open to talks but without losing the 20 per cent of Ukraine, largely the mineral-rich parts, which he currently controls.\n\nAt the end of the day, Putin has come out stronger while Zelenskyy survives by overriding all opposition. The west has no power to dictate its terms on Russia. Forthcoming elections in the US could alter the scenario forcing talks on Putin's terms, which would restrict expansion of NATO as well as Moscow holding onto territory it controls.\n\nWhile Russia would claim victory by displaying it captured Russian-speaking parts of Ukraine, Kyiv would project it managed to stall the powerful Russian army. Economically both have suffered, Ukraine much more.\n\nThe world would ultimately have to listen to what India has been stating all along, that talks is the only solution. The question remains who would mediate? As Jaishankar stated, 'Wherever we can help, we are happy to do so. We are open when we are approached. However, we do not believe that we should initiate anything in this direction on our own.'",

        "text": "A sinister wind is blowing through Britain's electoral system, with the emergence of groups that declare they can swing national elections along religious lines.\n\nYOU might be forgiven for thinking that Thursday's by-election in Rochdale will afford voters a chance to focus on healthcare, employment and child poverty, burning issues which the Greater Manchester town is struggling to deal with. You may even assume that these issues will determine who replaces Tony LLoyd MP, who died in service last night.\n\nBut you would be wrong. In reality, many voters will be locked in an embrace with events unfolding thousands of miles away.\n\nA sinister wind is blowing through Britain's electoral system, with the emergence of groups that declare they can swing national elections along religious lines.\n\nLeaders in the Muslimvoteuk campaign have actually instructed Muslims not to vote for MPs who did not support an immediate ceasefire in Gaza November last year. Azhar Ali was forced to resign from Labour's list after regurgitating abhorrent conspiracy theories about Israel's government deliberately allowing 1,139 of its citizens to be massacred on 7 October in order to give it the \"green light\" for military action in Gaza. But his name remains on the ballot and votes cast for him will shed a light on what influence these troubling religio- communal organisations, intent on directing votes along religious lines, truly have.\n\nMake no mistake: our democracy is under assault.\n\nAs a former counter extremism coordinator for the British government, with a career dedicated to countering hate ,I saw it when the words of the genocidal chant \"from the river to the sea,\" were projected on to Parliament's Elizabeth Tower.\n\nWe are less than three months into 2024, yet the year has already seen antisemitism hit heights not experienced since records began. Pro-Palestine marches result in arrest after arrest for support of terrorist organisations and Jewish friends of mine are considering leaving the UK all together.\n\nIn the meantime, Members of Parliament find themselves resigning at an alarming rate, driven out by threats from extremists or by flirting with extremism themselves through peddling antisemitic conspiracies.\n\nAs I and my colleagues desperately try to pull together strategies and initiatives to build bridges and track extremism, it becomes imperative to turn attention to the pending elections.\n\nThemuslimvote.co.uk's homepage carries the unapologetic declaration: \"This election marks a pivotal shift - Muslim concerns taking centre stage. With 4 million of us acting in unison, we wield significant influence.\"\n\nThey are not alone.\n\nThe Sikh Federation UK's annual report asserts: \"We are strategizing our vote alongside other minority communities, a force political parties cannot afford to ignore in the upcoming General Election.\"\n\nAnd the 2022 elections in Leicester illustrated how the Hindu community, feeling neglected by Labour politicians regarding Hindu-Muslim relations, swung the vote, securing 17 seats for conservatives on the city council.\n\nThe risk is clear: instead of exercising political rights individually, voters may succumb to groupthink, neglecting pressing issues such as healthcare and sacrificing those caught at the intersection like LGBT Muslims.\n\nOne contentious issue likely to dictate votes in our next General Election is not the cost of living crisis, but the stance on the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi.\n\nWhether a politician is seen to be pro or anti Modi, consumes both his critics and his staunch supporters.\n\nHere in Britain, none makes that clearer than Sikh Federation UK and Overseas Friends of the BJP.\n\nSikh Federation is self-described as an NGO that works with political parties to promote relevant Sikh issues.\n\nHowever, what it prioritises has nothing to do with Britain, but rather the breakup of India before its centenary in 2047.\n\nThemuslimvote capitalises on the Gaza tragedy to mobilise support, reducing intricate geopolitical matters to simplistic tribal affiliations.\n\nTheir landing page boldly highlights: \"On 15th November 2023, 81 percent of MPs did not back the ceasefire in Gaza\", followed by\n\na list of MPs representing areas with significant Muslim populations and their voting stances.\n\nWhile a ceasefire and a two-state solution are imperative, exploiting Palestinian suffering for tribal voting in the UK undermines multicultural unity.\n\nThe quest for tribalism depends on identifying - or creating - common enemies.\n\nA glance at themuslimvote's supporters unveils their target: Jews. Their backers include the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB) and MEND.\n\nDr. Siema Iqbal, chair of Mend Manchester working group, once retweeted during the 2014 Gaza conflict: \"Truce in Gaza? Don't you believe it! The Jews are shopping around for cheap bombs\".\n\nRoshan Salih of 5 Pillars has taken to the microphone to spread the muslimvoteUK message, listing MPs that did not vote for the ceasefire and calling on his \"Muslim brothers and sisters\" to ruin their careers.\n\nHe then declares Zionism to be the root of all evil, rejecting a two- state solution and calling for the eradication of the Jewish homeland.\n\nIt is little wonder, then, that Azhar Ali felt compelled to espouse anti-Israel conspiracies in a bid to get elected.\n\nIn a democracy, every voice matters, and it is only by valuing and defending the rights of the individual, whilst limiting foreign influence, that we can ensure a truly inclusive and ultimately safe society.\n\nReligio-communal voting may satisfy an innate sense of tribalism and give oneself a sense of one-upmanship over the \"establishment\", but it will ultimately be our vibrant multicultural societies very undoing.",

        "text": "Tel Aviv [Israel], February 25 (ANI): Brazil President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, once again alleged that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians, as reported by The Times of Israel.\n\nLast week, he raised controversy by comparing Israel's war with the Hamas terror group in Gaza to the Holocaust, \"when Hitler decided to kill the Jews.\"\n\nAlso Read | Ukraine Embassy in India, European Union Delegation Observe Minute of Silence To Mark Second Anniversary of Russia's War.\n\nHowever, Israel rejected the genocide claims, adding that its war is targeting the \"Palestinian terror group\" Hamas, and not the Palestinian people, following its October 7 massacre across southern Israel.\n\nIt has held Hamas responsible for civilian deaths and accused the terror group of deliberately operating from civilian areas and using the local population as human shields, according to The Times of Israel.\n\nAlso Read | Bangladesh Shocker: Minor Boy Dies During Circumcision Surgery in Dhaka Hospital, Family Alleges Overdose of Anesthesia During Surgery.\n\nBrazil President Lula posted on social media on Saturday that he will not give up his \"dignity for falsehood.\"\n\n\"What the Israeli government is doing is not war, it is genocide. Children and women are being murdered,\" he stated.\n\nhttps://x.com/LulaOficial/status/1761174646177607773?s=20\n\nHowever, last week, Israel responded with outrage to Lula's comments, calling them \"shameful,\" and declaring him \"persona non grata,\" which means, unacceptable, according to The Times of Israel.\n\nFurther, Jerusalem also summoned Brazil's ambassador for a rebuke and demanded an apology.\n\nIn response, Brazil recalled its ambassador for talks, and Israeli Ambassador Daniel Zonshine was himself summoned for a reprimand.\n\nNotably, Israel has been fighting Hamas in response to the deadliest attack on its territory, when thousands of Hamas terrorists broke through the border on October 7 and killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, amid acts of brutality and sexual violence, The Times of Israel reported.\n\nThey also abducted 253 Israeli civilians into Gaza, over 100 of whom remain captive -- some not alive -- following a temporary truce in late November that freed 105 hostages.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly claimed that Hamas is using Palestinian civilians as human shields, including by locating operations bases under hospitals, launching rockets from schools and shelters, building tunnel shafts under children's bedrooms, storing weapons in and around schools and mosques, and more, amid the ongoing war.\n\nMoreover, captured Hamas terrorists have confirmed some of the human shield claims, and explained that they know Israel will not target hospitals, medical centres or facilities.\n\nIsrael has also stressed that they will end the war if Hamas releases the remaining hostages and surrenders, as reported by The Times of Israel.\n\nIsrael Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded to Lula's previous comments, and said, \"The words of the President of Brazil are shameful and alarming. This is a trivialization of the Holocaust and an attempt to harm the Jewish people and Israel's right to defend itself.\"\n\n\"Israel is fighting for its defence and securing its future until complete victory and it does so while upholding international law,\" he added.\n\nMoreover, Foreign Minister Israel Katz called the comments \"shameful and grave.\"\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that last month, South Africa filed a complaint with the International Court of Justice accusing Israel of genocide in Gaza and demanding the court order Israel to stop the fighting.\n\nHowever, the case is expected to last years, as reported by The Times of Israel.\n\nThe court refused South Africa's request to take immediate measures to order Israel to halt its campaign but said there was \"plausibility\" to Pretoria's claim that Israel was in breach of certain elements of the Genocide Convention amid the war and said Jerusalem must make efforts to prevent harm to civilians.

        "title": "Emergency Imaginaries and Moving Forward",
        "text": "Where something like violence serves as a modality for social conflict and unrest, its foundations are nearly impossible to approximate, because they are continually shifting on a psychological level. People do not \"inflict\" harm on others in the strict sense -- it is a matter of following the unconscious mechanisms that undergird this process and defining a context that actually answers questions, instead of giving absolute responsibility to one person or entity. This is why the concept of emergency imaginaries is relevant, as it allows subjects to see their own participation in this space without reducing things to structural complaints.\n\nAn emergency imaginary is somewhere between an ideological frame of reference and the shared understanding of each others' humanity people come to possess. According to Calhoun,\n\n\"Emergency\" is now the primary term for referring to catastrophes, conflicts, and settings for human suffering...The emergency is a sudden, unpredictable event emerging against a background of ostensible normalcy, causing suffering or danger and demanding urgent response. (3)\n\nIn a word, people don't recognize an emergency until it has erupted seemingly out of nowhere. This has distinct parallels to certain philosophers' takes on how events emerge, whether Badiou's claim that an event is undecidable at the outset but whose resolution and effectuation entails fidelity, or Zizek's emphasis on radical contingency. An emergency simply shatters the psychological landscape in this way, so where does it come from? Calhoun goes on:\n\nIt calls for a humanitarian response, not political or economic analysis. The emergency has become a basic unit of global affairs, like the nation. \"Darfur\" is as much the name of an emergency as the name of a place. (3)\n\nI've covered how crises are approached in other essays, but the key point here is that when one signifies an event, it is never reducible to the ostensible conditions that anchor it. For example, when someone refers to 9/11, most will recount the trauma of witnessing it on television, the US's invasion of the middle east and all the hell that wrought, etc. There is never a single meaning for a signifier, so events in some sense have to be undecidable, much in the same way language forms itself retroactively through being articulated. An emergency here is a kind of eruption of the real, which is why the term imaginary is apt. And if one were to extrapolate to the symbolic, it becomes clear that we need emergency imaginaries to sustain our shared reality, precisely so underlying causes can be ignored. Calhoun distinguishes between the two main forms of emergency imaginaries, between which there is basically an irreducible gap:\n\nFirst, there are those concerned with emergences themselves. Emergencies are understood to be sudden, unpredictable, brief, or at least very urgent, and exceptions to some sort of normal order. Second are those features related to humanitarian response: the idea of neutrality, the notion of humanity as a mass of individuals equally entitled to care, and a sense of ethical obligation based on common humanity, rather than on citizenship or any other specific loyalty. (4)\n\nThis double-sided nature of our response to crises can be seen in everything from the West trying \"liberate\" Middle Eastern women from the repression of wearing a burka, not knowing that this actually represented cultural prestige and religious heritage; to the fact that one can't reconcile the conflicting realities between pro-Israel and pro-Palestine supporters. It is as if to say that humanity continually needs something catastrophic to bring it together, instead of simply working on the reality of their suffering and building from there. Universalism in our moment doesn't just mean decrying Israel's genocide; it is more about subjects recognizing their own particularity in a world where conventional notions of reality have been obscured.\n\nOf note here is the fact that when an emergency does erupt, there's always a kind of imperceptible shift in the discourse leading up to it, and then it's just there. Think of the pandemic: first there was mild chatter about some new virus in China, then it was business as usual, and then lockdown -- the new dream had simply emerged in a way that couldn't be approximated. And this isn't to say it always has to be bad. Often when people have spiritual experiences, there's a kind of suddenness to the way their new state of mind manifests, reframing everything without any one thing being explicitly different. And this brings me to the crux: humans will always need a form of what Hegel calls concrete universality to sustain their subjectivity. Our symbolic universes are not enough, which is why we need the imaginary; and this feeds into keeping the real balanced, with the point being that to prevent insane extremities like the Israel-Hamas conflict, one has to be aware of the reality they are creating with others.\n\nI mentioned underlying causes, and this can be seen in virtually every case of note. Whether the colonial logics that underpin our medical establishments in terms of how they disenfranchise minorities being surfaced during the pandemic or Israel's decades-long genocide, the point is that nothing ever \"just happens.\" So, if events have to have a certain contingency, but don't reveal their true causes until after they've been resolved, what does this say about emergency imaginaries? Calhoun answers this:\n\nTo imagine human beings in the...abstract, as it were, in their mere humanity, disembedded from kinship, religion, nationality; and other webs of identity and relationship is not universal. Replacing ties among people with a notion of equivalence among strangers is linked not only to ethical universalism, though, but also to the notion of \"bare life,\" and to the administrative gaze of states, and to thinking in terms of populations. (7)\n\nWhat he is saying is that the notion of equality is disenfranchising by ignoring the aforementioned particularity of individuals, and so contributes to the kind of state apparatuses that have given us shit healthcare, exorbitant military spending, and so on. Agamben and others talk about bare life in the concentration camps, but what about a space where people are suffering because there seems to be no way out, where there simply is no Other? This is why it's important to be aware of the fact that, while it is admirable for people to come together during times of crisis, waiting for an event to define one only makes them that much more of a slave to the forms of discourse that almost always end up being empowered by its consequences.\n\nCalhoun goes on to describe how it isn't always a matter of a monolithic state governing things, such as how it was the East India Company not Britain itself that launched colonial engagement in India, to highlight that one cannot simply blame those who seem to be in power. Additionally, over time, the dynamics between the economic and political became more indirect and entangled, i.e. shipping expeditions being used not only for colonial rule but also to reward captains, merchants, etc. This led to the false philanthropy of modern times, where once the other was excluded, the gifts of humanity could be given to all. This relates to everything from religious institutions to medical practice, but the point is that it is no longer about responsibility in the strict sense. Instead of disacknowledging participation, now what's needed is a reorientation to a reality each individual co-creates.",

That shelter just ran out of money this week,\" Melugin said.\n\nBill Wells, the mayor of nearby El Cajon, California, told Fox News that the wave of illegal immigrants crossing the border into California had become a \"serious problem\" for his town and that \"over the past few months, we've seen 100,000 migrants come across the San Diego border.\"\n\nThe footage from San Diego came on the same day Gov. Newsom was in Washington, D.C., for talks with President Joe Biden's administration; Newsom's office put out a media release saying the governor \"met with top White House officials on key California priorities today, focusing on securing more resources to tackle homelessness and behavioral health.\"\n\nIllegal immigration, you will not be surprised to learn, did not appear to be on the agenda -- or if it was, Newsom's office wasn't touting it.\n\nMeanwhile, Melugin was talking with the illegal immigrants from countries like China, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, India and Senegal, all of whom either sought work, asylum or perhaps both.\n\nTheir stated destinations were places like Atlanta, Chicago, New York City and New Jersey -- again, blue locales that have started to complain loudly now that the border crisis is affecting them.\n\nMelugin said he had been texting with officials, including El Cajon Mayor Wells, saying that \"Everyone's frustrated that the federal government essentially just says 'you deal with it,' they dump them in a city and say 'good luck.'\"\n\nAnd part of it is because, thanks to Texas trying -- and succeeding, at some level, despite Biden's best intentions to thwart them -- to secure the border, illegal immigrants were coming to places like California.\n\nFox News anchors asked whether Newsom had said anything about this.\n\n\"Not that I'm aware of,\" Melugin said.\n\n\"I know he's in Washington, D.C., today -- but, eventually, look, these images are probably going to cause him a little bit of a political issue. Look, what's happening in Texas. They are fortifying their border with razor wire, with National Guard, with troopers, they're kicking the feds out and their illegal crossings have fallen off a cliff here.\n\n\"What has happened as a result? A lot of the illegal crossings are now in -- a big majority of them are now in -- California and Arizona, blue states run by blue governors who really aren't doing any sort of resistance at the state level in terms of trying to stop these illegal crossings.\"\n\nNewsom's office did have a comment for Fox News, telling them that \"[w]hen it comes to border security, Republicans in Congress have done nothing but create chaos and sabotage any attempts at progress,\" a spokesperson said.\n\n\"In the absence of any political courage from the Republican Party, California has once again stepped up -- making historic investments and serving as a model of partnership for a safe and humane border. It's past time for the spineless politicians in Congress to do their job.\"\n\nWhat Newsom's office is referring to is a so-called \"border bill\" -- really an omnibus spending bill that includes money for Ukraine and Israel -- that House Republicans have made clear is insufficient.\n\n\"This bill is even worse than we expected, and won't come close to ending the border catastrophe the President has created,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson wrote on social media after the bill passed the Senate.\n\n\"As the lead Democrat negotiator proclaimed: Under this legislation, 'the border never closes,'\" Johnson added, noting: \"If this bill reaches the House, it will be dead on arrival.\"\n\nSo, what's the solution beyond that? Fortifying California's borders? Telling illegal immigrants not to come? Stop pretending there isn't a border crisis?\n\nThe fact that Joe Biden is unwilling to do this is part of the reason his approval rating is below 40 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics polling aggregate. Newsom doesn't have to fret about this, having just won re-election in one of the nation's most liberal states. If he hopes to make it to any higher office, however, he can't stop pretending this doesn't matter and it's all on the Republicans to step up and do what the Democrats say -- which wouldn't make the slightest difference, anyhow.\n\nGavin Newsom owns this. And if he doesn't do anything, it's only going to get worse from here.",

        "title": "The Future of the US Military: Europe or Asia?",
        "text": "The year 1973 was crucial for the US military. That force left Vietnam battered and destroyed. In January, the Secretary of Defense announced the end of the draft; Two months later, the last combat soldiers were leaving Vietnam. However, the Arab-Israeli war that broke out on Yom Kippur in October planted the seeds of renewal. The lessons of that war, assimilated by American officers sent to Israel, helped reshape the American military into the modern, professional force that would prevail in Iraq in 1991.\n\nToday's generals, who came of age during that transformation, are well aware of the resonance. \"There is a vague analogy between the early 1970s and the Army of Desert Storm,\" says Gen. James Rainey, who heads the U.S. Army Futures Command; \"and between the army that invaded Iraq in the early 2000s and where we need to be in 2040.\" Two decades of war in Afghanistan and Iraq wore down soldiers, equipment and ideas. The recruiting shortage remains unresolved. Now, the rise of China and the lessons of the Ukraine war have prompted introspection, renewal and reform.\n\nThere are three major pending issues raised among the civilian and military officials of the army, according to sources familiar with these debates. One is whether profound changes in the character of warfare (some of which are evident in Ukraine) may cause ground forces to become less important, or even irrelevant.\n\nThe second is how to balance resources between Asia and Europe (where Asia is the Pentagon's priority and Europe where Russia is hastily rearming). The military can prepare for conflicts in both places, but in practice it cannot fight both wars at the same time; and is no longer asked to do so. The 2018 National Defense Strategy ended the \"two wars\" rule, a change embraced by the Biden administration.\n\nThat brings us to the third question, the most existential for the army. What would be, beyond logistics and air defense facilitation, the role of a ground force in a future war in the Pacific?\n\nWhen General Randy George, the Army Chief of Staff, was asked not long ago to recommend a book, he cited The Arms of Future by Jack Watling, a young British analyst. The book tells that in the latest rounds of Warfighter, a large annual exercise led by the United States, combat brigades facing increasingly better sensors and munitions with greater range and lethality have suffered enormous losses, ending up with 20% of combat capability. Artillery annihilates infantry and armor long before they can get into enemy sight.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has reinforced these conclusions. Some maintain that the US army, better trained and armed than the Ukrainian one, and also having air cover, would fare better. However, General Rainey assumes the worst. \"We are going to fight under constant observation, and in permanent contact in some way. There is no pause. There is no shelter.\" He adds that American \"lessons learned\" teams were on site three days before the invasion to collect observations. They will have had some unpleasant surprises: at first, American-made GPS-guided projectiles and rockets worked well; more recently, they have had difficulties in the face of Russian interference operations.\n\nThe military recognizes that, where it once could patiently gather its forces and then launch a full-scale offensive (as it did against Iraq in 1991 and 2003), it now has to prioritize dispersion, mobility and concealment. The drone strike that killed three soldiers in Jordan on Jan. 28 was the first successful airstrike against U.S. troops since the Korean War. Katie Crombe, an Army officer, and John Nagl, a professor at the United States Army War College in Pennsylvania, point out in a recent article that the command posts of the Ukrainian battalions are made up of seven soldiers who hide underground and They move twice a day. \"That standard,\" they warn, referring to the deep-rooted habits of hardened command positions, \"will be difficult to achieve in the case of the US Army.\"\n\nThe leaders of the battalions (about 1,000 soldiers) and brigades (a few thousand), the central combat units in Afghanistan and Iraq, would be consumed by these intense combats in a way that was not the case during counterinsurgency missions. So the military is being reorganized so that more of the burden of planning, logistics, command and control, and long-range firepower falls on divisions, larger formations typically led by two-star generals. who are further from the front lines and have more time and space to organize the frenetic battles of the future.\n\nWhat remains unresolved, says Billy Fabian, a former infantry officer and Pentagon planner, is the specific way the Army's combat forces should be organized for future wars: the balance between, on the one hand, firepower , dominant in Ukraine, and, on the other, the so-called maneuver elements, such as infantry and armor. \"Fighting ground wars is the military's raison d'\u00eatre,\" he says, \"and Ukraine raises difficult questions that challenge deep-rooted elements that are fundamental to the military's self-conception.\"\n\nLooming over those reforms is the broader question of where the military will be asked to fight. National defense strategies released by the Trump and Biden administrations task the Pentagon with focusing on China. The US military actually increased its presence in Europe after the first Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014. And since then, it has reinforced the continent with a corps and division headquarters, an armored and infantry brigade, a battalion of rocket artillery and numerous other support forces. In contrast, relatively few new forces have arrived in Asia.\n\nFor many years, the US military's primary role in the Pacific has been to guard bases, provide air defense and handle logistics. To the extent that it was a \"maneuver\" force, in military jargon, it was focused on North Korea. Other services have looked down on him. \"The Navy has a stranglehold on the direction of Indo-Pacific Command,\" says Stacie Pettyjohn of the Center for a New American Security, a Washington think tank. \"They consider that the army only has a supporting role in a maritime theater.\"\n\nGeneral Charles Flynn, head of the US military in the Pacific, strongly refutes such ideas in conversation with The Economist at his headquarters in Hawaii. \"Human beings have the unique tendency to live on land,\" he says. \"Ultimately, decisions are going to be made with the pointy end of a gun.\" Land primacy is as true in Asia as in Europe, he maintains; among other things, because the largest countries in the region, such as India and Indonesia, have militaries dominated by armies. The idea is that by strengthening ties with them in peacetime, the army can position itself to project military power westward.\n\nThe increasing pace of maneuvers (more than 40 are carried out a year) is an essential part of this process. General Flynn points to the examples of Talisman Saber in Australia and Garuda Shield in Indonesia. Both were once relatively modest exercises between one army and another. They have grown and now have the participation of the navy and air forces. Both have also involved the Army's Pacific Joint Multinational Readiness Center, essentially a physical and virtual training team capable of deploying throughout the region to do things that could only be done at a large base in Louisiana. These exercises are becoming a nearly permanent presence: the army remains in the region for eight months a year.\n\nAlong with this there is a reformulation of the army's way of fighting. The premise is that China has optimized its forces to attack American satellites, ships and air bases. \"What it is not designed to do,\" says General Bernard Harrington, \"is to find, fix and destroy distributed, mobile and networked land formations.\" That has prompted the creation of three experimental \"multi-domain task forces,\" the first of which is focused on Asia and commanded by General Harrington.\n\nEach force has four battalions capable of deploying small units along the first island chain from Japan to the Philippines. The idea is that they can fight not only on land (soldier against soldier, tank against tank) but across domains. Let's imagine that the United States needs to attack a Chinese ship. The multi-domain task force's \"effects\" battalion will attempt to jam its radar and penetrate its networks; If this does not neutralize the ship, it will at least increase the probability that the anti-ship missiles launched by a \"fires\" battalion will be able to reach it. The force's long-range hypersonic missiles, deployed last year, have a range of just under 3,000 kilometers, enough to go from Japan to Taiwan or from the Philippines to the South China Sea.\n\nEarly experiments with multi-domain task forces have shown promise, although some are skeptical that this high-tech vision of warfare will survive contact with reality. On the other hand, they have also provided useful lessons. General Harrington says an exercise in the Philippines last year served as a reminder that HIMAR rocket launchers and intelligence equipment, with many delicate electronic components, perform worse in the heat and humidity of tropical Asia than in the field. test center where they were initially tested. Currently, there are two multi-domain task forces dedicated to Asia, and a third for Europe. The original plan called for a total of five, with an additional one in the Arctic and another for global tasks.\n\nAll of this seems to offer a definitive answer to the army's identity crisis: Asia first. However, within the Department of the Army, which is located in the Pentagon, some doubts persist in this regard. One of them is whether their plans agree with those of the armed forces as a whole. \"The military still feels marginalized in the Pacific,\" says Pettyjohn. Another question is whether the army itself has pivoted forcefully enough. For example, its fleet of boats has been drastically reduced in recent years. \"The ships are an absolute indicator of true commitment to the Pacific,\" says J. P. Clark, another Army War College professor. \"They are quite expensive, really useful only in that theater of operations and absolutely essential.\"\n\nMulti-domain task forces themselves remain \"niche\" formations, Fabian maintains. The largest formation assigned to the region is the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii, he notes, a light infantry division. \"It seems that the Army tries to have it all,\" Fabian argues. \"It talks about fires and air defense for the Pacific, but it is still a combined arms force organized for close range combat as it always has been.\" The military hedges its bets, says one well-informed source, because it rarely fights the war it expects.\n\nTrade-offs abound. Short-range artillery is vital for Europe; not so much in Asia. \"What are you going to shoot 155 projectiles at in the Pacific if not into the water,\" a senior Pentagon official joked not long ago. The military will have to make firm decisions within a year or two, officials say. In part, because they are creating more units than they can reliably handle. The army estimated that it would end the year with a shortage of 10,000 recruits, a 15% deficit and the second consecutive year of insufficient enlistment. Much of this is due to the rigidity of the American labor market, but it is also a reflection of declining enthusiasm for military service, and for combat weapons in particular.\n\nThe drop in the size of the \"individual prepared reserve\" (reservists not assigned to a specific unit) from a contingent of 450,000 in 1994 to 76,000 in 2018 exacerbates the problem. Ukraine shows how intense wars tend to crush regular armies and demand an injection of citizens with military experience. The current shortage of combat soldiers is the future shortage of reservists. Crombe and Nagl are among supporters of the notion of \"partial recruitment,\" an idea supported by only 20% of Americans. Now, as in the crucial moments of the mid-1970s, the military finds itself grappling with profound questions about its size, shape, and purpose -- questions that will ultimately affect, as they did then, its relationship with American society.\n\n\u00a9 2024 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

        "text": "Expressing deep dismay over what they perceive as the Indian government's passivity on the issue, Indians for Palestine criticized its reluctance to outrightly condemn Israel's assaults on Gaza and Palestinians in the West Bank.\n\nIn a call to action, Indians for Palestine has demanded that the Narendra Modi government publicly endorse the recent ruling of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to stand against violations of Palestinian human rights in Gaza. The group has urged the Indian government to refrain from any complicity with Israel and to condemn its actions in the region.\n\nExpressing deep dismay over what they perceive as the Indian government's passivity on the issue, Indians for Palestine criticized its reluctance to outrightly condemn Israel's assaults on Gaza and Palestinians in the West Bank.\n\nThey highlighted India's continued collaboration with Israel, particularly in defence and surveillance sectors, citing recent reports of military drones jointly produced by Adani-Elbit Advanced Systems India Ltd. being sent to Israel amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza.\n\nThe group underscored that many other Indian companies are involved in subsidized joint ventures with Israeli weapons manufacturers, further implicating India in the conflict. To pressure the Indian government into aligning with the ICJ ruling and condemning Israeli actions, Indians for Palestine convened a meeting at the Constitution Club in New Delhi on February 23.\n\nThe meeting witnessed the participation of representatives from various sectors including political parties, media, diplomatic community, legal profession, and foreign policy experts, along with several hundred attendees.\n\nDuring the gathering, the group emphasized India's role in facilitating the recruitment of Indian workers to replace Palestinian workers whose permits have been suspended, denouncing this move as objectionable and indicative of India's support for Israel's decisions.\n\nIndians for Palestine also raised concerns about the potential risks faced by Indian workers deployed in Israel and accused the Indian government of suppressing protests against the alleged genocide unfolding in Gaza.\n\nINTERNATIONAL COURT AND JUSTICE FOR GAZA: A PUBLIC MEETING ON THE ICJ RULING\n\n(New Delhi, 23 February 2024)\n\nBy January 11, 2024, the daily death rate in Gaza was higher than in any other major 21st-century conflict. The death toll in Israel's ongoing assault on Gaza has now crossed 29,000, most of whom are women and children, with over 70,000 Gazans wounded. Among those killed are approximately 85 journalists and media workers, 152 UN workers, 600 health workers and 12,000 children. The long-term impacts of this continuing massacre go far beyond the immediate casualties: deepening poverty, severe water crisis, the shutdown of healthcare systems, and chronic trauma. According to international experts, the victims of starvation and disease in Gaza may exceed the number of those killed directly during Israeli attacks.\n\nOn January 26, 2024, in response to South Africa's application against Israel for violating the Genocide Convention in its attacks on Gaza, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Israel must \"take all measures within its power\" to prevent such actions. This ruling is of historic significance because it is for the first time that the world's highest court has held Israel culpable for its violations of international human rights laws concerning Palestinians. In this regard, the ICJ has deemed the arguments from South Africa as substantiating a plausible claim of genocide.\n\nThis landmark order of the ICJ also imposes a moral and legal obligation on other country members of the ICJ and signatories of the Genocide Convention, including India, to cease funding or facilitating Israel's military actions. The signatories to the Genocide Convention are obligated to prevent genocide, conspiracy to commit genocide, incitement to commit genocide and complicity in genocide. They risk transgressing the Convention if there is no reprimanding of, or suspension of economic-cultural-social relations with Israel - a member country now being tried for genocide. Such is the devastation already caused by Israel's actions that there is a moral responsibility on all signatories to the Convention to unequivocally oppose Israel's continuing onslaught.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa declared in a statement on 8th February that given his country's legacy as a nation that has fought and defeated Apartheid, it has a particular obligation to stand up for the rights of people everywhere. It is crucial to remember that India's position has also been one of opposing Apartheid.\n\nGiven this shared stance, we are dismayed to note the Indian government's passivity on the issue and its refusal to forthrightly condemn Israel's inhuman assault on Gaza and Palestinians in the West Bank. Unlike many other countries in the Global South that are re-assessing their relations with Israel, India continues its close collaboration with it, particularly in the defence and surveillance sectors. It is deeply disturbing, for instance, to learn from recent media reports that amid Israel's ongoing war on Gaza, twenty Hermes-900 military drones produced jointly by Adani-Elbit Advanced Systems India Ltd. have been sent to Israel for possible deployment in Gaza. Many other Indian companies are also involved in subsidized joint ventures with Israeli weapons manufacturers.\n\nThe Indian government is also facilitating the recruitment of Indian workers in replacement of Palestinian workers whose work permits are now suspended. This move is objectionable not just in its support of Israel's decision against Palestinian workers but also in its indifference to the possible dangers facing Indian workers being sent to Israel. The Indian government has further played into the hands of Israel by suppressing all attempts to protest against the unfolding genocide in Gaza.\n\nWe thus call upon the Indian government to publicly endorse the latest ruling of the ICJ, stand against all violations of the human rights of Palestinians in Gaza and refrain from any sort of complicity with Israel. We demand an immediate ceasefire in Palestine.\n\nWe further call on people across Asia to demonstrate collective solidarity with the people of Palestine - in spirit, resources, speech, and action. We particularly welcome the recent decision of the Water Transport Workers Federation of India - representing 3,500 workers at 11 major Indian ports - to refuse any cooperation with the loading or unloading of \"weaponized cargoes from Israel or any other country which could handle military equipment and its allied cargo for war in Palestine\". Many other steps can be taken to express support for Palestine, including the submission of photo/video evidence of ongoing war crimes (accessed through verified accounts of Palestinian journalists) through the online portal of the International Criminal Court. We should not be left behind as mass protests are sweeping across the world.\n\nStand for Palestine! Stand for Humanity! Ceasefire Now!\n\n-- - Indians for Palestine (a group of concerned citizens)",

        "text": "Israel's envoy to India has denounced a film-maker from his country after he called a Bollywood blockbuster about disputed Kashmir \"propaganda\" and a \"vulgar movie\", stoking a debate about recent history that fuels the ongoing conflict.\n\nNaor Gilon said he was \"extremely hurt\" by Nadav Lapid's comments that The Kashmir Files was unworthy of being screened at the highly acclaimed International Film Festival of India.\n\nThe event, organised by the Indian government in western Goa state, ended on Monday.\n\nThe Kashmir Files, which was released in March, is largely set in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, when attacks and threats by militants led to the migration of most Kashmiri Hindus from the Muslim-majority disputed region.\n\nMany film critics and Kashmiri Muslims have called the movie hateful propaganda, while its fans and proponents, including India's many federal government ministers, see it as essential viewing on the plight of Kashmiri Hindus, locally called Pandits.\n\nKashmir is divided between India and Pakistan and both claim the territory in full. In 1989, tens of thousands of mostly Kashmiri Muslims rose up against Indian rule, leading to a protracted armed conflict in the region.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr Gilon tweeted to Lapid: \"You should be ashamed.\"\n\n\"I'm no film expert but I do know that it's insensitive and presumptuous to speak about historic events before deeply studying them and which are an open wound in India because many of the involved are still around and still paying a price,\" he wrote.\n\nHe also accused Lapid of inflicting damage on the growing relationship between India and Israel.\n\nThe festival jury has distanced itself from Lapid's remarks and called them his \"personal opinion\".\n\nAn internationally acclaimed director, Lapid's movies Synonyms and Ahad's Knee have won awards at major festivals.\n\nAt the time of its release, The Kashmir Files was endorsed by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and promoted by his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party by offering it tax breaks in some states governed by it.\n\nThe film, however, set off heated debates.\n\nIts supporters praised it for speaking the truth about Kashmiri Hindus, while critics said the film was aimed at stoking anti-Muslim sentiments at a time when calls for violence against India's minority Muslims have increased.\n\nNeverthess, the film was a blockbuster. Made on a budget of 2 million US dollars (\u00a31.7 million), it has earned more than 43 million dollars (\u00a335.7 million) so far, making it one of India's highest-grossing films this year.\n\nThe makers of The Kashmir Files have repeatedly said it exposes what they call the \"genocide\" inflicted on the region's Hindus and likened it to Hollywood's Schindler's List, which tells the story of the Holocaust. But many critics, including some of Bollywood's top directors, have called it divisive, full of factual inaccuracies and provocative.\n\nHindus lived mostly peacefully alongside Muslims for centuries across the Himalayan region of Kashmir.\n\nIn the late 1980s, when Kashmir turned into a battleground, attacks and threats by militants led to the departure of most Kashmiri Hindus, who identified with India's rule, Many believed that the rebellion was also aimed at wiping them out.\n\nIt reduced the Hindus from an estimated 200,000 to a tiny minority of about 5,000 in the Kashmir Valley.\n\nMost of the region's Muslims, long resentful of Indian rule, deny that Hindus were systematically targeted, and say India helped them to move out in order to cast Kashmir's freedom struggle as Islamic extremism.\n\nAccording to official data, more than 200 Kashmiri Hindus were killed in the last three decades of the region's conflict. Some Hindu groups put the number much higher.\n\nTensions in Kashmir returned in 2019, when India's Hindu nationalist government stripped the region's semi-autonomy, split it into two federal territories administered by New Delhi and imposed a crackdown on free speech accompanied by widespread arrests.\n\nKashmir has since witnessed a spate of targeted killings, including that of Hindus. Police blame anti-India rebels for the killings.\n\nOn Tuesday, The Kashmir Files actor Anupam Kher, who plays a protagonist, called the criticism of the film \"pre-planned\".\n\n\"If the Holocaust is right, then the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits is also right,\" he said in a video posted on Twitter.\n\nThe Kashmir Files is directed by Vivek Agnihotri, whose previous film, The Tashkent Files, alleged a conspiracy over the death of former prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri. The film was heavily criticised for presenting unproven conspiracy theories as facts.",

And in our judgement, this only weakens -- it doesn't strengthen -- Israel's security,\" said the top American diplomat, a day after Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich indicated that more than 3,000 new residences would be added to settlements.\n\nAlso Read | Russia-Ukraine War: Three Ukrainian Civilians Killed in Russian Drone Attacks on Odesa.\n\nThe statement comes as the Biden administration's latest shift away from the pro-Israel policies pursued by former president Donald Trump.\n\nThe Trump administration reversed the US policy to declare that settlements did not violate international law. In 2019, under Trump, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo claimed that \"the establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not, per se, inconsistent with international law\".\n\nBlinken's statement was defended by the White House in Washington DC.\n\n\"(We have) seen those reports and, frankly, disappointed in the announcement. It's been long-standing US policy under both Republican and Democratic administrations that new settlements are counterproductive to the cause of peace. Frankly, they're also inconsistent with international law. And this administration maintains our firm opposition to settlement expansion,\" John Kirby, a White House spokesman, told reporters.\n\nThe New York Times reported that in November 2019, the then Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, under then-president Donald Trump reversed four decades of US policy by saying that settlements did not violate international law.\n\n\"State Department lawyers never issued a new legal determination that buttressed that policy change and Mr. Blinken's shift back to the old policy is consistent with a long-standing legal finding of the department,\" the daily reported.\n\n\"We are simply reaffirming the fundamental conclusion that these settlements are inconsistent with international law. This is a position that has been consistent over a range of Republican and Democratic administrations. If there's an administration that is being inconsistent, it was the previous one,\" Kirby told reporters.\n\nIn Buenos Aires, Blinken said he had seen reports about the post-war Gaza plan.\n\n\"I haven't seen the plan, so I want to reserve judgment until we see the details. Having said that, you know that there are certain basic principles that we set out many months ago that we feel are very important when it comes to Gaza's future, including that it cannot be a platform for terrorism,\" he said.\n\n\"There should be no Israeli reoccupation of Gaza. The size of Gaza's territory should not be reduced. So, we want to make sure that any plan that emerges is consistent with those principles. There are other principles, but those are three of the most important ones,\" Blinken said.\n\n\"At the same time, we have many countries in the region that are working together on a plan for post-conflict Gaza. I think that's very important, and I've spent some time with some of our Arab partners, including recently on the margins of the G20, talking about just as we did when we were at the Munich Security Conference together. So, it's important that we have, again, a necessary plan, but one also that's consistent with basic principles that I think many countries share about what has to be Gaza's future,\" said the Secretary of State.\n\nThe reversal comes amidst growing US-Israeli tensions over the war in Gaza, with the latest settlement announcement only adding to the strain.\n\nThe United Nations' highest court, the International Court of Justice, is also holding hearings into the legality of the Israeli occupation.",

        "text": "Since the Islamist group Hamas attacked Israel and killed at least 1,200 of its citizens on Oct. 7 last year, Israel's retaliatory military operation in Gaza has killed about 29,000 people and forcibly displaced an estimated 1.9 million of the small Palestinian territory's 2.4 million inhabitants from their homes. Israel has been confidently claiming a legitimate self-defense right to take such actions.\n\nInternational law never authorizes any nation to take such disproportionate and atrociously violent measures. It is horrifying that the international community appears to by and large overlook such a grave breach of international norms.\n\nHowever, the international jurisprudence perspective has been repeatedly commented on by many experts. I myself would rather focus on the wider historical context in which Israel appears to unhesitatingly employ what I deem immoral tactics.\n\nAt the time of Israel's inception in 1948, about 700,000\n\nPalestinians were driven from their land. They became refugees, and the number of their descendants has grown to over 5 million. So long as their anger and resentment persist, Israel as a state remains unstable and vulnerable.\n\nThis sense of uncertainty has always characterized the nature of the Jewish state's psyche. Surrounded by sizeable Arab nations, the small Mediterranean nation has believed that it needs strenuous efforts to militarize itself to ensure absolute supremacy over the Palestinians and neighboring nations. But by repeatedly displacing Palestinians from their properties in the West Bank and East Jerusalem since 1948, especially since the 1967 Yom Kippur War, Israel has only made itself much less secure.\n\nWhen I was serving as the Japanese ambassador to the Holy See, Cardinal Renato Martino said that Gaza increasingly resembled a \"big concentration camp.\" The controversial comment referred to Israel's military strikes against Gaza, including its offensive in December 2008 and January 2009, which resulted in the death of about 1,400 Palestinians. My impression was that his remark echoed the sentiment of most Vatican officials. No doubt it offended the Israelis.\n\nEven so, the kind of behavior Israel has historically demonstrated would not particularly stand out in the world up to the mid-20th century, a time until which quite a few nations used to implement displacement and forced deportation. This was particularly the case when borders were reshaped because of war, revolution or the independence of nations.\n\nA typical instance was the displacement of approximately 400,000 Muslims from contemporary Greece and an estimated 1.2 million Greek Christians from contemporary Turkey. The massive exchange of people was based on the Lausanne Peace Treaty in 1923, which redefined the border between Turkey and Greece.\n\nBetween 1945 and 1947, the then Czechoslovakia and other Central and Eastern European states are said to have expelled some 7 million Germans. Approximately 500,000 Ukrainians were displaced from Poland to Soviet Ukraine.\n\nWhen India and Pakistan were partitioned in 1947, over 10 million people had to move between the new countries' borders. Muslims fled to Pakistan while Hindus and Sikhs went to India. It is estimated that over 1 million people were killed in a process rife with communal violence.\n\nThe paradigm of nations has since transformed by 180 degrees. Forced displacement of people is today deemed a stark violation of international humanitarian law. The Israeli government appears to be stuck in an obsolete mindset from about eight decades ago. The United States and other Group of Seven advanced nations are particularly urged to discourage Israel from resorting to the unethical measure of displacement.",

The deployment of nuclear weapons during the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in [...]\n\nThe global arsenal of nuclear warheads exceeds 12,000, possessed by the world's nuclear powers. These weapons have the capacity to cause direct casualties in the millions and, due to their potential impact on agriculture, could potentially result in the deaths of billions.\n\nThe deployment of nuclear weapons during the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 caused fatalities ranging from 110,000 to 210,000. Since then, the world has faced numerous close calls with the potential use of nuclear weapons.\n\nTo curb the proliferation and reduce the number of nuclear weapons, international efforts have been made. This includes information on the number of states possessing nuclear weapons, the quantity of warheads in their possession, the nations opposing nuclear weapons, and the evolution of these dynamics over time.\n\nFew countries possess nuclear weapons, but some have large arsenals\n\nA limited number of nations possess nuclear weapons, with varying arsenal sizes. Currently, nine countries hold nuclear weapons: Russia, the United States, China, France, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, India, Israel, and North Korea.\n\nSignificant disparities exist among these nuclear powers in terms of the quantity of nuclear warheads they possess. The chart illustrates that, while most countries maintain dozens or a few hundred warheads, Russia and the United States possess thousands of them.\n\nThe specific number of nuclear weapons held by each country is treated as a closely guarded national secret, introducing significant uncertainty into the estimates provided here. Most nuclear-armed states offer little to no information regarding the sizes of their nuclear stockpiles. However, the level of secrecy varies among countries.\n\nBetween 2010 and 2018, the United States openly disclosed its total stockpile size, but this practice was halted by the Trump administration in 2019. In 2020, the Biden administration reinstated nuclear transparency briefly. However, it chose not to declassify any US stockpile data for 2021 or 2022. Similarly, in 2021, the United Kingdom announced its decision to no longer disclose public figures for its operational stockpile, deployed warhead, or deployed missile numbers. Furthermore, as of 2023, both the United States and Russia have opted not to exchange publicly available data about their deployed strategic warheads and launchers, as mandated by the New START Treaty.\n\nDespite these challenges, publicly accessible information, meticulous analysis of historical records, and occasional leaks allow for the best possible estimates regarding the size and composition of national nuclear weapon stockpiles.\n\nA lot of countries have given up obtaining nuclear weapons\n\nThe current count of countries possessing nuclear weapons is at its highest point in history. South Africa stands as the lone nation to completely dismantle its arsenal.\n\nThe chart indicates that numerous states have contemplated or actively pursued nuclear weapons, with the vast majority ultimately abandoning such endeavours. In the late 1970s, over a dozen countries explored or engaged in efforts to acquire nuclear weapons. In recent times, Syria has contemplated nuclear weapons, and Iran has been the sole country actively pursuing their development.\n\nThe number of nuclear weapons has declined substantially since the end of the Cold War\n\nThe number of nuclear weapons has experienced a significant decline since the conclusion of the Cold War. Following a continuous increase for nearly five decades since their inception in the 1940s, nuclear arsenals peaked at over 60,000 warheads in 1986.\n\nHowever, a reversal of this trend is evident in the chart. Nuclear powers substantially reduced their arsenals in the subsequent decades, with the number of warheads dropping below 20,000 in the 2010s.\n\nWhile the decline has decelerated in recent times, the total stockpile still surpasses 10,000 warheads, and some countries have even expanded their arsenals.\n\nThe destructiveness of nuclear arsenals has declined\n\nThe previous chart, which provided a straightforward count of the number of warheads, lacked consideration for the varying explosive power of these weapons and the constraints on simultaneous usage. The following chart endeavours to address this by factoring in the destructiveness and deployment of nuclear warheads, providing an estimate of the explosive power of weapons deliverable in a first strike.\n\nExamining the data reveals that the United States rapidly developed significantly more potent warheads in the 1950s. While the Soviet Union increased the destructiveness of its weapons more gradually, it eventually reached comparable levels.\n\nThe destructive potential of first-strike warheads peaked at over 15,000 megatons (Mt) in the early 1980s, equivalent to more than a million Hiroshima bombs. At this zenith, these weapons could annihilate more than 40% of the total urban land worldwide.\n\nDespite a steady decline in the destructiveness of first strikes over the decades for both the United States and the Soviet Union/Russia, it has remained above 2,500 Mt. This implies the potential to directly destroy almost 7% of the total urban land worldwide.\n\nNuclear weapons tests have almost stopped\n\nNuclear weapons states were once prolific in testing their warheads, with a peak of 178 tests in 1962, predominantly carried out by the United States and the Soviet Union. These tests had detrimental effects on the environment and people, particularly indigenous communities.\n\nIn subsequent years, the frequency of tests decreased, and in the last two decades, nuclear weapons testing has almost ceased. Notably, North Korea is the sole country that has conducted recent nuclear weapons tests.",

        "text": "Tehran strenuously denies any connection with the mainly Shiite militias\n\nDUBAI:\u00c2 Iran and the US are engaged in an intensifying proxy war, which is playing out across several Middle Eastern states. Although neither side appears to be looking for a direct confrontation, vulnerable Arab countries with divided loyalties are paying the biggest price.\n\nThat seems to be the consensus view of Middle East experts as low-intensity wars rage on in several parts of the region in addition to the full-on Gaza conflict.\n\nSince Oct. 7 last year, Iran-backed militias have mounted more than 170 attacks on US military bases and assets in Syria, Iraq and Jordan in response to US support for Israel in the Israel-Hamas war, prompting American retaliation.\n\nMeanwhile, Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Houthi allies in Yemen have launched repeated attacks on commercial and military shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, likewise prompting retaliatory strikes by the US and UK on militia targets.\n\nWhile analysts believe the US and Iran are unlikely to become embroiled in a direct state-on-state confrontation, attacks by Iranian proxies are expected to occur for as long as Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s military campaign in Gaza continues.\n\nSome experts think Iran is acutely aware of the Biden administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fear of a regional escalation and has sought to exploit this threat as a means of influencing the course of the war in Gaza.\n\nAli Alfoneh, a senior fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington, believes Iran is trying \u00e2\u0080\u009cto instrumentalize that fear by directly ordering, indirectly encouraging, or acquiescing to proxy attacks against Israel, the US, and international shipping.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn this way, Iran \u00e2\u0080\u009chopes a terrified Biden administration will increase pressure on Israel to end the war before total destruction of Hamas,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told Arab News.\n\nHowever, this proxy war is playing out on the sovereign territories of Syria, Iraq, Jordan, and Yemen \u00e2\u0080\" all nations that can ill-afford to be swept up in a regional conflict. Some commentators say Arab lives in these countries are being treated as expendable.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think the attacks signal bloody bargaining between America and Israel on one side and Iran on the other,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Ayad Abu Shakra, a journalist at Asharq Al-Awsat, told Arab News.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think there is any \u00e2\u0080\u0098war of survival\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or a \u00e2\u0080\u0098war of elimination\u00e2\u0080\u0099 between the two camps, the Israeli-American camp and the Iranian camp. They are bargaining, as if in a bazaar, but with blood. The Iranians are fighting the Americans with Arab bodies and vice versa.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis bargaining, as it were, has the potential to get out of hand, however.\n\nOn Jan. 28, US forces stationed at Tower 22, a remote installation in Jordan, close to the Syrian and Iraqi borders, came under drone attack, leaving three US soldiers dead and 34 wounded.\n\nUS President Joe Biden said the drone attack was launched from Iraq by an Iran-backed militia. He vowed to retaliate at a time and in a manner of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choosing.\n\nOn Feb. 3, the US military launched an air assault on 85 targets at seven locations across Iraq and Syria including command and control headquarters and weapon storage sites used by Iran-backed militias and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\nThis was followed on Feb. 7 by a drone attack on eastern Baghdad that killed Abu Baqir Al-Saadi, commander of Kataib Hezbollah, the Iraqi militia that Washington had deemed responsible for the attack on US troops in Jordan.\n\nIran of course denies links to any militias in the Middle East. For instance, in a Jan. 29 letter to the UN Security Council,\u00c2 Amir Saeid Iravani, Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambassador to the UN, said:\u00c2 \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is no group affiliated with the Islamic Republic or Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s armed forces, whether in Iraq, Syria, or elsewhere that operates directly or indirectly under the control of the Islamic Republic of Iran or acts on its behalf.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTherefore, the Islamic Republic of Iran is not responsible for the actions of any individual or group within the region.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSome Republican lawmakers had exhorted the administration to authorize a direct strike against Iran, even if it risked sparking a wider escalation. Others accused Biden of responding too slowly and giving the enemy too much forewarning.\n\nWary about being dragged into another potentially open-ended Middle East war, especially during an election year, Biden has appeared keen to limit the scope of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retaliation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Biden administration partially called the Islamic Republic\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bluff by harshly reacting to the killing of three American servicemen and women in Jordan, but publicly signaled that it would not target Iranian territory,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alfoneh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cRetaliating for the loss of American life was a correct response, but the US would perhaps be better off keeping the Islamic Republic guessing about America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s retaliation, which may include Iranian territory in the future.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIran is likewise mindful of the potential blowback from its activities. But by operating through its network of proxies throughout the region, Tehran feels it can deny any involvement in attacks on Israel or US targets while reaping the benefits.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter 1979, when Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini declared the export of the Islamic revolution, Iranians formed the IRGC,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Abu Shakra.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was almost an open secret that they would rather fight their wars of negotiations with the Americans and Israelis in Arab cities rather than fight them in Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cities.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey eventually took over Beirut, Baghdad, Damascus and Sanaa, and now they are negotiating with the Americans and the Israelis through massacres, in which the Arabs are paying the price, not the Iranians.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nNevertheless, according to analysts, Iran has sometimes overplayed its hand, leading to a more aggressive US response, as was the case when the administration of former President Donald Trump ordered the killing of Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani in Jan. 2020, allegedly to stave off a planned attack on US forces in Iraq.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey are reminded of the accepted bargaining limits,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Abu Shakra. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe assassination of Qassem Soleimani, for example, was such a reminder and a big hit. Both America and Iran are still respecting \u00e2\u0080\u0098the rules of engagement.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe latest US retaliation does appear to have had an impact. On Feb. 12, the Pentagon announced there had been 186 US casualties in Iraq, Syria and Jordan since Oct. 18. A day later, on Feb. 13, it declared there had been no further attacks on US forces.\n\nWashington is also likely in no hurry to attack Iran directly because the survival of the Islamic Republic has other uses. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important to note that Iran is a sizable player whom the West can \u00e2\u0080\u0098use\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in any role,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Abu Shakra.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWhether Washington admits it or not, Iran is a very important bulwark against the rise of Sunni militant Islam. Iran is also a potential counterbalance against a nuclear Pakistan. Iran is an important bulwark against the expansion of the Chinese in the Gulf.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cNo one has the strategic interest of destroying Iran. Neither America, nor Russia, nor India can ignore the role or influence of Iran.\u00e2\u0080\u009dCritics of the Biden administration say its hesitance about a direct confrontation with Iran was demonstrated by its response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, including efforts through media leaks to play down an Iranian link and prevent a regional escalation.\n\nWhen Israel began its retaliatory campaign in Gaza, the US said there was no proof that Iran was behind the Oct. 7 attack, said Abu Shakra. Then, within a week or two, the US said it did not want the conflict to spread.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThey wanted it to be limited,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Americans did not want any involvement with the Iranian militias in Lebanon and Iraq. I think unless the Iranians overplay their cards and become too arrogant, the current fighting will remain limited to Iran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Arab appendages.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI think neither the US nor Israel nor the pro-Tehran Iraqi regime or Iran itself has any real interest in direct confrontation, which would be apocalyptic if it were to happen.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nLikewise, Alfoneh believes Iran has little to gain from a direct conflict with the US. Instead, it can outsource its activities to proxies to tilt regional affairs in its favor.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Islamic Republic achieved all of its objectives on Oct. 7,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alfoneh. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHamas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 terrorist incursion into Israel shattered the myth of Israel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s invulnerability.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIran got even with Israel, which for years has bombed Iranian and allied positions in Syria, and even engaged in operations on Iranian soil, and the attack sabotaged diplomatic normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe interests of the Palestinians, and indeed the populations of the wider Arab region caught in the crossfire, are thereby secondary to these geopolitical goals.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe fate of Hamas and Palestinian civilians is of no interest to the Islamic Republic, which perceives them as expendable pawns in a grander chess game in the region,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Alfoneh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTherefore, the Islamic Republic is not interested in spreading the war in Gaza, which may directly entangle Iran in a war with Israel and, possibly, with the US.\u00e2\u0080\u009d",

        "text": "Crude oil and gasoline prices on Friday retreated on concern about Chinese energy demand. Crude was also under pressure from signs that Israel will join peace talks in Paris on the Hamas war, which could reduce some geopolitical risk. A weaker dollar and a rally in the S&P 500 to a record high on Friday were positive factors for crude prices.\n\nCrude prices fell back Friday after Reuters reported Thursday night that Israel will send negotiators to truce talks in Paris today to talk about a ceasefire in the war with Hamas and a return of Israeli hostages.\n\nRBC Capital Markets said domestic oil demand in China has been soft, and limited stimulus measures from the government have been disappointing. Also, the growth in diesel inventories since the middle of 2023 is \"a worry.\"\n\nCrude prices are supported by concern that the Israel-Hamas war will widen to Lebanon after the leader of Hezbollah said it would retaliate against Israel and hit \"not just army sites\" in Israel after Israel attacked positions and killed civilians in Lebanon. Hezbollah and Israel have traded fire almost daily since the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct 7. Also, the U.S. and UK have engaged in airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen in retaliation for Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels have forced shippers to divert shipments around the southern tip of Africa instead of going through the Red Sea, disrupting global crude oil supplies.\n\nCrude prices also have support from Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries and oil storage facilities that have curtailed Russian fuel exports. On Feb 3, a drone attack by Ukraine damaged Russia's Lukoil PJSC facility in Volgograd, which processed 289,000 bpd of crude oil in January, or more than 5% of Russia's total crude processing volume. On Jan 25, a drone attack damaged Russia's Rosneft PJSC's major Tuapse refinery on Russia's Black Sea coast. Russia said on Jan 26 that the Tuapse refinery, which processed 180,000 bpd of crude in the first half of January, will be shut down through at least February. In recent weeks, several Russian oil processing and storage facilities have been targeted and damaged by Ukrainian drone attacks, increasing the risks of reducing Russian crude exports.\n\nA decline in Russian crude oil exports is supportive of crude oil prices. Tanker-tracking data from Vortexa, monitored by Bloomberg, shows Russian crude exports in the week to Feb 11 fell about -290,000 bpd from the prior week to 3.49 million bpd.\n\nStrong oil-product consumption in India, the world's third largest crude consumer, is bullish for oil prices after India's Jan oil-product consumption rose +8.3% y/y to 20 MMT, the most in 9 months.\n\nA decline in crude in floating storage is bullish for prices. Monday's weekly data from Vortexa showed that the amount of crude oil held worldwide on tankers that have been stationary for at least a week fell -19% w/w to 73.18 million bbl as of Feb 16.\n\nOn Nov 30, OPEC+ agreed to cut crude production by -1.0 million bpd through June 2024. However, a Bloomberg survey on Thursday showed the group cut production by only -490,000 bpd in January, less than the official -1.0 million bpd cut. Meanwhile, on Dec 21, Angola announced it was leaving OPEC amid a dispute over oil production quotas.\n\nSaudi Arabia said on Nov 30 that it would maintain its unilateral crude production cut of 1.0 million bpd through Q1-2024. The move would maintain Saudi Arabia's crude output at about 9 million bpd, the lowest level in three years. Russia also said it will deepen its voluntary oil export cuts by 200,000 bpd to 500,000 bpd in Q1 of 2024. OPEC Jan crude production fell -1.59 million bpd to 26.570 million bpd, a 2-1/2 year low.\n\nThursday's EIA report showed that (1) U.S. crude oil inventories as of Feb 16 were -1.8% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -1.9% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -10.4% below the 5-year seasonal average. U.S. crude oil production in the week ended Feb 16 was unchanged w/w at a record high of 13.3 million bpd.\n\nBaker Hughes reported Friday that active U.S. oil rigs in the week ended Feb 23 rose by +6 rigs to 503 rigs, modestly above the 2-year low of 494 rigs posted on Nov 10. The number of U.S. oil rigs has fallen over the past year from the 3-3/4 year high of 627 rigs posted in December 2022.\n\nMore Energy News from Barchart\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Only the Middle East Can Fix the Middle East",
        "text": "In the early weeks of 2024, as the catastrophic war in the Gaza Strip began to inflame the broader region, the stability of the Middle East appeared to be once again at the center of the U.S. foreign policy agenda. In the initial days after Hamas's October 7 attacks, the Biden administration moved two aircraft carrier strike groups and a nuclear-powered submarine to the Middle East, while a steady stream of senior U.S. officials, including President Joe Biden, began making high-profile trips to the region. Then, as the conflict became more difficult to contain, the United States went further. In early November, in response to attacks on U.S. military personnel in Iraq and Syria by Iranian-backed groups, the United States conducted strikes on weapons sites in Syria used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps; in early January, U.S. forces killed a senior commander of one of these groups in Baghdad. And in mid-January, after weeks of attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea by the Houthi movement, which is also supported by Iran, the United States, together with the United Kingdom, initiated a series of strikes on Houthi strongholds in Yemen.Despite this show of force, it would be unwise to bet on the United States' committing major diplomatic and security resources to the Middle East over the longer term. Well before Hamas's October 7 attacks, successive U.S. administrations had signaled their intent to shift away from the region to devote more attention to a rising China. The Biden administration has also been contending with Russia's war in Ukraine, further limiting its bandwidth for coping with the Middle East. By 2023, U.S. officials had largely given up on a revived nuclear agreement with Iran, seeking instead to reach informal de-escalation arrangements with their Iranian counterparts. At the same time, the administration was bolstering the military capacity of regional partners such as Saudi Arabia in an effort to transfer some of the security burden from Washington. Despite Biden's early reluctance to do business with Riyadh -- whose leadership U.S. intelligence believes was responsible for the 2018 killing of the Saudi journalist and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi -- the president prioritized a deal to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel. In pursuing the deal, the United States was willing to offer significant incentives to both sides while mostly ignoring the Palestinian issue.\n\nOctober 7 upended this approach, underscoring the centrality of the Palestinian issue and forcing the United States into more direct military engagement. Yet remarkably, the war in Gaza has not led to significant shifts in Washington's underlying policy orientation. The administration continues to push for Saudi normalization despite Israeli opposition to a separate state for the Palestinians, which the Saudis have made a condition of any such agreement. And U.S. officials seem unlikely to end their effort to disentangle the United States from Middle East conflicts. If anything, the war's increasingly complicated dynamics may result in even less U.S. appetite for engagement in the region. Doubling down on commitments in the Middle East is also not likely to be a winning strategy for either American political party in a crucial election year.\n\nOf course, the United States will continue to be involved in the Middle East. If missile strikes on U.S. forces result in American deaths or if a terrorist attack linked to the Gaza conflict kills American civilians, it could force a greater U.S. military engagement than the administration might want. But waiting for the United States to take the lead in effectively managing Gaza and delivering a lasting Middle East peace would be like waiting for Godot: current regional and global dynamics simply make it too difficult for Washington to play that dominant role. That doesn't mean that other global powers will replace the United States. Neither European nor Chinese leaders have demonstrated much interest in or capacity for taking on the job, even as U.S. influence wanes. Given this emerging reality, regional powers -- particularly Israel's immediate Arab neighbors Egypt and Jordan, along with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which have been coordinating since the war began -- urgently need to step up and define a collective way forward.\n\nFinding common ground after Hamas's brutal October 7 attacks and Israel's devastating campaign in Gaza will be exceptionally difficult. And the longer the war continues, the greater the risk of broader fractures across the Middle East. But in the years preceding the attacks, both Arab and non-Arab states showed the potential for new forms of cooperation in what amounted to a major reset of relations across the region. Even after months of war, many of these ties have remained intact. Now, before this trend reverses, these governments must come together to build lasting mechanisms for conflict prevention and, ultimately, peace.\n\nMost urgently, regional powers must support a meaningful political process between the Israelis and the Palestinians. But they should also take decisive steps to prevent such a cataclysm from happening again. In particular, they should seek to establish new and stronger regional security arrangements that can provide stability with or without U.S. leadership. It is well past time for the Middle East to have a standing forum for regional security that establishes a permanent venue for dialogue among its own powers. Gleaning opportunity from tragedy will take hard work and a commitment at the highest political levels. But as distant as this vision may seem today, the potential exists for Middle East leaders to arrest the spiral of violence and move the region in a more positive direction.\n\nANXIETIES OF INFLUENCE\n\nDespite mounting frustration with the Biden administration for not taking decisive action to end the war, some Arab leaders, along with pro-interventionists in Washington, may be eager to see the United States \"back\" in the Middle East. The Biden administration's swift diplomatic and military response -- and its willingness to use force against Iranian-aligned groups -- has suggested that the region is once more at the heart of U.S. national security concerns. In fact, in terms of military might, the United States never left: at the time of the October 7 attacks, tens of thousands of U.S. forces were already stationed in the region, and Washington continues to maintain sizable military bases in Bahrain and Qatar, as well as smaller military deployments in Syria and Iraq.\n\nBut the United States' military and diplomatic activity since October 7 has not instilled confidence. For one thing, the administration's effort to prevent a wider regional conflict has been decidedly mixed. At one of the most concerning flash points, Israel's simmering conflict with Hezbollah on the Lebanese border, Washington has been unable to prevent growing violence on both sides. Along with significant military and civilian casualties, tens of thousands of civilians have been forced to evacuate towns in northern Israel and southern Lebanon. Hezbollah has thus far refused to withdraw its forces from the border in exchange for economic incentives, and Israel -- which has already assassinated a top Hamas official in Beirut -- has signaled that time is running out for diplomacy.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States has struggled to contain military pressure from Iranian proxies in Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. Since the start of the war, U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have faced more than 150 attacks from these groups. And despite a series of retaliatory strikes by the United States and the United Kingdom, Washington has been unable to put an end to the Houthis' relentless missile and drone attacks in the Red Sea. Already, the Houthis have been able to cause significant disruptions to international trade, forcing major shipping companies to avoid the Suez Canal. Notably, U.S. attempts to corral a multinational maritime force to counter the threat have been unable to attract regional partners such as Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, which remain wary of the administration's Gaza policies.\n\nAs Washington's military leverage diminishes, its diplomatic muscle has also weakened. Rather than showing resolve, the continual visits of senior administration officials to the region have demonstrated how little sway the United States retains -- or in the case of Israel, the administration's unwillingness to use it. During the initial months of the war, one of the administration's few apparent accomplishments was a one-week pause in fighting in late November, which led to the release of over 100 Israeli and foreign hostages and a modest delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. But even in that case, Qatari and Egyptian mediation was crucial. Otherwise, the United States has been unwilling (at least as of this writing) to call for a cease-fire, and the administration's public diplomacy has mostly been limited to rhetorical efforts to restrain the worst impulses of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his right-wing government.\n\nThe administration has been more vocal in promoting \"day after\" peace ideas focused on what it calls a \"revitalized\" Palestinian Authority leadership in the West Bank and Gaza and regional support for rebuilding Gaza. But regional powers, particularly the wealthy Gulf Arab states, have made clear that they will not endorse such plans without irreversible steps toward Palestinian statehood. After U.S. officials began speaking more publicly about the need for a two-state solution as part of a larger normalization pact with Saudi Arabia, Netanyahu flatly rejected the possibility and insisted that Israel must remain in full security control of Palestinian areas. But even centrist Israeli officials expressed astonishment that the United States was pressing peace initiatives while the all-out war against Hamas was continuing. Meanwhile, the administration's backing of Israel in the fighting and its perceived lack of empathy for Palestinian suffering have created significant obstacles to attracting regional support, let alone Palestinian buy-in, for any American-led plan.\n\nThe United States will continue to be a major player in the region because of its military assets and its unparalleled relationship with Israel. But any expectation that Washington will be able to achieve a grand bargain that could definitively end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is detached from the realities of today's Middle East. In the end, major diplomatic breakthroughs are most likely to come from, and depend on, the region itself.\n\nGOING IT ALONE, TOGETHER\n\nThe consequences of Washington's diminishing influence in the Middle East have not been limited to the current conflict. As U.S. engagement in the region declined in the years leading up to October 7, major regional powers steadily increased their efforts to shape and set security arrangements. Indeed, beginning in 2019, governments across the region began to mend previously fraught relations. This unusual regional reset was driven not only by economic priorities -- overcoming frictions that had previously disrupted or held back trade and growth -- but also by the perception that Washington's interest in managing Middle East conflicts was waning.\n\nTake the rapprochement between the Gulf states and Iran. In 2019, the UAE began restoring bilateral ties with Iran after a three-year rupture, seeing an opportunity to directly manage relations and protect its interests from Iranian-backed groups that had been disrupting Gulf shipping and threatening Emirati tourism and trade. Abu Dhabi formally resumed diplomatic ties with Tehran in 2022, paving the way for Riyadh to follow suit. In March 2023, the longtime rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran announced that they were resuming relations in an accord brokered by China after months of back-channel talks moderated by Oman and Iraq. The United States had no part in these deals.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2021, Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE ended a three-and-a-half-year blockade of Qatar that had been motivated principally by Qatar's backing of Muslim Brotherhood groups, its close ties with Iran and Turkey, and its activist Al Jazeera television channel. Around the same time, the UAE and Saudi Arabia reconciled with Turkey, which they had previously shunned in response to Turkish support for Qatar and for groups affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood. (Saudi-Turkish ties had also been strained because of a Turkish judicial investigation into the murder of Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.) By resuming ties, the Saudis and Emiratis opened the door to crucial Gulf investment in the struggling Turkish economy. And in May 2023, Arab leaders invited Syrian President Bashar al-Assad back into the Arab League, marking the end of more than a decade of isolation during Syria's brutal civil war.\n\nAs part of this broader reset, governments across the Middle East also began to participate in a variety of regional forums. The Baghdad Conference for Cooperation and Partnership, which met for the first time in Baghdad in 2021 and again in Amman in 2022 to discuss Iraq's stability, convened a wide array of previous rivals -- including Iran and Turkey, the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, and Jordan and Egypt. The East Mediterranean Gas Forum, established in 2020, brought together Cyprus, Egypt, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, and Jordan, along with representatives from the Palestinian Authority, in what is designed to be a regular dialogue built around gas security and decarbonization. And the so-called I2U2, a group that includes India, Israel, the UAE, and the United States, was set up in 2021 to foster cross-regional partnerships focusing on health, infrastructure, and energy.\n\nAnother aspect of this regional reset was Israel's normalization with several Arab governments. In the 2020 Abraham Accords, Bahrain, Morocco, and the UAE agreed to establish formal ties with Israel, creating opportunities for new economic relations and trade. Notably, one goal of the accords was to pave the way for new direct security relationships between Israel and the Arab world. Before the October 7 attacks, the Biden administration had high hopes that Saudi Arabia, as a leading member of the Arab world, would also join this group. Building on those accords, the March 2022 Negev Summit brought together Bahrain, Egypt, Israel, Morocco, the UAE, and the United States to encourage economic and security cooperation in what was intended to be a regular meeting.\n\nGlaringly absent from the normalization deals, however, was the Palestinian issue, which was largely set aside. As a result, Jordan refused to participate in the Negev Summit, and as tensions over Israel's settlements in the West Bank flared in early 2023, a further meeting of the group was repeatedly postponed. Now, with the devastation of Gaza, any further progress will be contingent on not just ending the war but also building a viable plan for a Palestinian state.\n\nRUPTURES AND RESILIENCE\n\nIn theory, the catastrophic war in Gaza would seem to pose a grave threat to the Middle East reset. In most cases, newly established regional relations are still fragile and have yet to address thorny issues such as weapons proliferation, the continued backing of militant groups in Libya and Sudan by the UAE, Iran's support for armed nonstate militia groups across the region, and Syria's export of the drug Captagon. Along with endangering Israel's fledging normalization of relations with Arab governments, the intensifying involvement of Iranian-backed groups -- from Hezbollah and the Houthis to various militias in Syria and Iraq -- has the potential to create new fissures between Iran and the Gulf states. Yet so far, the emerging realignments have proved surprisingly durable.\n\nMeanwhile, diplomatic ties between Israel and its Abraham Accord partners have so far held. The UAE has made clear that it views dialogue with the Israeli government, even in the current crisis, as an important way to make progress on an Israeli-Palestinian political settlement. And although Bahrain's parliament has condemned the sustained assault on Gaza, the country has not formally severed ties with Israel. For both Arab states, normalization is not just about strengthening economic bonds with Israel but also reinforcing strategic ties with the United States. For despite Washington's perceived shift away from the region in recent years, Gulf Arab states still seek U.S. security guarantees and protection: in January 2022, Biden designated Qatar as a \"major non-NATO ally,\" and in September 2023, Bahrain and the United States signed an agreement to strengthen their strategic partnership.\n\nCertainly, the war has created new obstacles to regional cooperation, particularly when it comes to Israel and neighboring states. Both Turkey and Jordan have withdrawn their ambassadors from Israel, and direct flights between Israel and Morocco stopped in October. By late January, with more than 26,000 killed in Gaza and no cease-fire in sight, Arab public opinion was more strongly opposed to normalization than ever. Many also fear that the U.S. and British military strikes on the Houthis could embolden the group in Yemen and set back efforts to formalize a longsought cease-fire in the Houthis' nearly decadelong war in Yemen with Saudi Arabia. And although Gulf Arab states have made a commitment to continue reaching out diplomatically to Tehran, few officials in the region are hopeful that Iran will alter its approach of \"forward defense,\" in which it relies on militant groups to build strategic leverage and maintain deterrence. In mid-January, Tehran's direct missile strikes on Iraq, Pakistan, and Syria in response to Israeli strikes and an attack by the Islamic State in the Iranian city of Kerman increased tensions further.\n\nFor now, there are indications that Middle East leaders seek to transcend these disputes. For example, to manage growing economic pressure and unrest at home, Iran has given new priority to regional business and trade relations not only with Gulf Arab states but also with Iraq, Turkey, and Central Asian countries, as well as China and Russia. This points to the pragmatic impulses driving Tehran's message that it seeks to avoid direct engagement in the Gaza conflict despite its backing of various proxy groups. But as tit-for-tat attacks mount across the region in the absence of a Gaza cease-fire, Iran's calculations could very well shift.\n\nParadoxically, one of the strongest forces holding the region together may be the plight of Gaza itself and the Palestinian issue, which the war has so starkly brought to world attention. Facing overwhelming popular anger and the long-term potential for radicalization and the return of extremist groups, regional leaders have largely aligned their policy responses to the war. Despite divergent strategies toward Israel and the Palestinians before October 7, governments around the Middle East are broadly united on demanding an immediate cease-fire, opposing any transfer of Palestinians out of Gaza, calling for humanitarian access to Gaza and for the urgent provision of aid, and supporting negotiations for the release of Israeli hostages in return for an end to the war. The question now is whether this unity can be steered toward building a legitimate peace process.\n\nFor many regional Arab and Muslim countries, the highest priority has been defining a clear plan for Gaza and, ultimately, Palestinian statehood. Israeli leaders have suggested that Gulf states with substantial resources, such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, might share the cost of rebuilding Gaza. But Israel's current government has said it opposes a Palestinian state, and with the war continuing, no Arab governments are willing to make such a commitment or be seen to be underwriting Israel's war effort. Instead, they have unveiled their own proposals for a postwar peace.\n\nIn December 2023, Egypt and Qatar put forward a plan that began with a cease-fire contingent on phased hostage releases and prisoner exchanges. After a transition period, these confidence-building steps would, in theory, lead to the creation of a Palestinian unity government. Composed of members of both Fatah, the nationalist party that has long controlled the PA, and Hamas, the new leadership would jointly run the West Bank and Gaza, in view of a critical regional demand that the different Palestinian territories no longer be politically separated. This last phase would require Palestinian elections and the creation of a Palestinian state. Although Israel dismissed the plan itself, both for the inclusion of Hamas and over the issue of statehood, it provided a starting point for further discussion.\n\nIn turn, Turkey has floated the concept of a multicountry guarantor system, with states in the region protecting and bolstering Palestinian security and governance and the United States and European countries providing security guarantees for Israel. Others have proposed that the United Nations run a transitional authority in the West Bank and Gaza, an approach that would allow time to overhaul the Palestinian governance structure and ultimately lay the groundwork for Palestinian elections. For its part, Iran has repeatedly stated that it will reinforce any outcome that is supported by the Palestinians themselves -- suggesting that there is a renewed opportunity to persuade Tehran to support a deal and forestall its usual spoiler role.\n\nMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia has been developing a peace plan with other Arab states that would condition normalizing ties with Israel on the creation of an irrevocable path to a Palestinian state. Riyadh's approach is underpinned by the 2002 Arab peace initiative that committed to Arab recognition of Israel in exchange for the creation of a Palestinian state in East Jerusalem, Gaza, and the West Bank. The current Saudi plan aligns with Washington's push for Israeli-Saudi normalization. It remains unclear, however, whether the Saudis would agree with their American counterparts on what constitutes credible and irreversible steps toward a Palestinian state, particularly given strong Israeli resistance.\n\nUnder Netanyahu, the Israeli government continues to reject all these proposals. But as of late January, Israel remained far from accomplishing its war aim of eradicating Hamas, and it had yet to secure the release of more than 100 remaining hostages. There were also rising tensions in both the war cabinet and the Israeli public about the future course of the military campaign. Moreover, the country has deferred any serious public or political debate on its future security until the war is over. When that happens, Israel will need to have open diplomatic channels with, and secure funding and security guarantees from, Arab governments, as well as retain Washington's engagement through the process.\n\nIt may take years to establish the necessary political conditions for a serious peace process after such a terrible war. Nonetheless, the conflict and its regional spillover are a stark reminder that although the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is not the only cause, regional stability will be at constant risk as long as it continues. And regional governments are increasingly aware that they cannot rely on the United States alone to provide a viable peace process for them.\n\nRIVALS INTO NEIGHBORS\n\nEven as it has thrust the Palestinian issue back to the forefront of the international agenda, the war in Gaza has underscored the important new political dynamics in play across the Middle East. On the one hand, the United States appears to have less influence. But at the same time, regional powers, including those previously at odds, are taking the initiative, involving themselves in mediation, and coordinating their policy responses. Whereas before October 7, regional powers -- in particular, Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the UAE -- were less aligned on the Palestinian issue, they are now acting with impressive unity, coordination, and planning. To turn this shared resolve into a lasting source of collective leadership, however, these powers must embrace more permanent regional institutions and arrangements.\n\nMost critically, these should include a standing dialogue forum for the entire region. Episodic summits for cabinet ministers and ad hoc \"minilateral\" groupings such as the East Mediterranean Gas Forum and I2U2 will no doubt continue to define the regional landscape in the years ahead. But a permanent forum for regional security is lacking. In other parts of the world, cooperative security forums, such as the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, have been able to develop alongside bilateral and regional security alliances, enhancing communication even among adversaries and helping prevent conflict. There is no reason for the Middle East to remain the global exception. And given the region's pressing need to coordinate and de-escalate, the current crisis provides a crucial opportunity to begin such an initiative.\n\nAlthough leaders have been skeptical about the idea of a forum embracing the entire region, there are several ways that new cooperative security mechanisms could be built. For example, ever since the Madrid peace process was launched in the early 1990s to address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, such arrangements have been informally proposed in dialogues among experts. Over the past few years, numerous policymakers and others have made clear that this approach is ripe for implementation at an official level. Although such a forum should ultimately aim to include the entire region -- all Arab states, Iran, Israel, and Turkey -- that won't immediately be feasible. But a smaller number of key states could start an official process, holding open the prospect of wider participation down the road. Since several Arab states and Turkey have relationships with both Israel and Iran, their participation will be especially valuable at the outset.\n\nThe new organization, which could be called the MENA Forum, to encompass the broadest understanding of the Middle East and North Africa region, should initially focus on cross-cutting issues on which there is broad consensus, such as climate, energy, and emergency responses to crises. Although the resolution of the Gaza war and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will likely need to be led through a separate Arab initiative, the forum could coordinate positions on postwar Gaza through its emergency response agenda, including humanitarian support and reconstruction aid for Palestinians. The forum would not directly mediate conflicts itself: cooperative security dialogues have proved most effective when focused on improving communication and coordination to defuse tensions and on providing mutual security and socioeconomic benefits to members. But through regular contacts and a gradual building of trust, such a process could support conflict resolution in the Israeli-Palestinian arena and beyond.\n\nIndeed, standing regional meetings can provide important opportunities, not to mention political cover, for dialogues on contentious disputes among rivals and adversaries who otherwise lack direct channels of communication. These could include not only Israelis and Palestinians but eventually also Israelis and Iranians, who could meet in technical working groups on noncontroversial issues of mutual concern. Such interactions have already quietly unfolded on the sidelines of other multilateral forums focused on climate and water, suggesting that more inclusive regional cooperation is ultimately possible.\n\nEstablishing a Middle East security forum will require political will at the highest levels, as well as a strong regional champion that is considered a neutral party. One possibility is to announce the new organization at a meeting of foreign ministers, possibly on the margins of another regional gathering, like one of the economic sessions that have been held at the Dead Sea in Jordan. The initiative will be more likely to succeed if it is both created and led from the region. Middle powers in Asia and Europe could provide political and technical support in areas where they may have valuable expertise, for example. At least at the outset, China, Russia, and the United States should have limited roles to prevent the forum from turning into another platform for great-power competition. Nonetheless, support from both Washington and Beijing will be critical to ensure that the forum becomes a useful supplement, rather than a threat, to their own diplomacy in the region.\n\nA TIME TO LEAD\n\nAmong the difficult realities that the war in Gaza has exposed, one of the starkest may be the limits of American power. As much as it may be wished for, the United States is unlikely to provide the decisive leadership or the leverage needed to push through a lasting Israeli-Palestinian settlement. It will be up to the Middle East's own leaders and diplomats to take charge. By capturing the region's attention and diplomatic energy, the war has provided a rare opportunity for new forms of cooperative leadership.\n\nA regional security forum cannot by itself deliver Middle East peace -- no single initiative can do that. And without accountable governance, genuine long-term stability will remain elusive. Nor is an organization like this going to replace all the competitive power balancing that has long been a hallmark of Middle East statecraft. Even in Asia and Europe, cooperative arrangements have not supplanted national strategic rivalries or been able to foreclose military confrontation, as the war in Ukraine has so painfully demonstrated. Nonetheless, a regular forum would add a crucial layer of stability to the conflict-prone Middle East. Such a project is also increasingly urgent.\n\nAlthough October 7 has not yet reversed all the regional currents favoring de-escalation and accommodation, time may be running out to capitalize on this reset. Leading Arab states, together with regional powers such as Turkey, must seize the moment to lock in some of the rapprochement that preceded Gaza and the coordination that has arisen since. The Middle East is facing a moment of reckoning. If it becomes paralyzed by the horrific bloodshed in Gaza, it could further descend into crisis and conflict. Or it can start building a different future.",

        "title": "Crude Prices Under Pressure from Concerns About Chinese Energy Demand",
        "text": "Crude oil and gasoline prices this morning are moderately lower on concern about Chinese energy demand. Crude oil prices are also under pressure from signs that Israel will join peace talks in Paris on the Hamas war, which could reduce some geopolitical risk. Losses in crude oil are limited by a weaker dollar and a rally in the S&P 500 to a record high, which indicates confidence in the economic outlook and energy demand.\n\nCrude prices are under pressure after Reuters reported Thursday night that Israel will send negotiators to truce talks in Paris today to talk about a ceasefire and a return of Israeli hostages.\n\nRBC Capital Markets said domestic oil demand in China has been soft, and limited stimulus measures from the government have been disappointing. Also, the growth in diesel inventories since the middle of 2023 is \"a worry.\"\n\nCrude prices are supported by concern that the Israel-Hamas war will widen to Lebanon after the leader of Hezbollah said it would retaliate against Israel and hit \"not just army sites\" in Israel after Israel attacked positions and killed civilians in Lebanon. Hezbollah and Israel have traded fire almost daily since the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct 7. Also, the U.S. and UK have engaged in airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen in retaliation for Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels have forced shippers to divert shipments around the southern tip of Africa instead of going through the Red Sea, disrupting global crude oil supplies.\n\nCrude prices also have support from Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries and oil storage facilities that have curtailed Russian fuel exports. On Feb 3, a drone attack by Ukraine damaged Russia's Lukoil PJSC facility in Volgograd, which processed 289,000 bpd of crude oil in January, or more than 5% of Russia's total crude processing volume. On Jan 25, a drone attack damaged Russia's Rosneft PJSC's major Tuapse refinery on Russia's Black Sea coast. Russia said on Jan 26 that the Tuapse refinery, which processed 180,000 bpd of crude in the first half of January, will be shut down through at least February. In recent weeks, several Russian oil processing and storage facilities have been targeted and damaged by Ukrainian drone attacks, increasing the risks of reducing Russian crude exports.\n\nA decline in Russian crude oil exports is supportive of crude oil prices. Tanker-tracking data from Vortexa, monitored by Bloomberg, shows Russian crude exports in the week to Feb 11 fell about -290,000 bpd from the prior week to 3.49 million bpd.\n\nStrong oil-product consumption in India, the world's third largest crude consumer, is bullish for oil prices after India's Jan oil-product consumption rose +8.3% y/y to 20 MMT, the most in 9 months.\n\nA decline in crude in floating storage is bullish for prices. Monday's weekly data from Vortexa showed that the amount of crude oil held worldwide on tankers that have been stationary for at least a week fell -19% w/w to 73.18 million bbl as of Feb 16.\n\nOn Nov 30, OPEC+ agreed to cut crude production by -1.0 million bpd through June 2024. However, a Bloomberg survey on Thursday showed the group cut production by only -490,000 bpd in January, less than the official -1.0 million bpd cut. Meanwhile, on Dec 21, Angola announced it was leaving OPEC amid a dispute over oil production quotas.\n\nSaudi Arabia said on Nov 30 that it would maintain its unilateral crude production cut of 1.0 million bpd through Q1-2024. The move would maintain Saudi Arabia's crude output at about 9 million bpd, the lowest level in three years. Russia also said it will deepen its voluntary oil export cuts by 200,000 bpd to 500,000 bpd in Q1 of 2024. OPEC Jan crude production fell -1.59 million bpd to 26.570 million bpd, a 2-1/2 year low.\n\nThursday's EIA report showed that (1) U.S. crude oil inventories as of Feb 16 were -1.8% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -1.9% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -10.4% below the 5-year seasonal average. U.S. crude oil production in the week ended Feb 16 was unchanged w/w at a record high of 13.3 million bpd.\n\nBaker Hughes reported last Friday that active U.S. oil rigs in the week ended Feb 16 fell by -2 rigs to 497 rigs, just above the 2-year low of 494 rigs posted on Nov 10. The number of U.S. oil rigs has fallen over the past year from the 3-3/4 year high of 627 rigs posted in December 2022.\n\nMore Crude Oil News from Barchart\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

According to the local authorities, they hit a nine-storey building destroying several flats. Search operations are still underway.\n\nAccording to the Ukrainian NGO Humanitarian Platform, an independent body of 78 Ukrainian and international NGOs providing humanitarian assistance in Ukraine, the war has killed more than 10,500 civilians, including 587 children, and left around 20,000 injured.\n\nThe constant shelling, they say, is leaving a \"generation traumatised, displaced and fearful for their lives\".\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is heading to Ukraine on Friday to try to reassure President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other officials that Congress will deliver another round of military aid, even as a package that would provide $60 billion to Ukraine remains in limbo in the House of Representatives.\n\nSchumer's surprise trip comes at a perilous time for Ukraine. Zelenskyy has said that delays in aid from the US and other Western countries are creating an opening for Russia to make advances on the battlefield, with Ukrainian forces running dangerously low on ammunition and weaponry.\n\nWhile the Senate passed a $95 billion (\u20ac87.7 billion) package to aid Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan last week on a bipartisan vote, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson has not yet put forward a plan for passing it in the House.\n\nSchumer told The Associated Press that he plans to tell Ukrainian officials that \"we're going to win this fight, and America is not abandoning them.\"\n\nZelenskyy has stressed that all possible efforts must be made to end the war by the end of 2024.\n\nThe European Union announced Friday that it is imposing sanctions on several foreign companies over allegations that they have exported dual-use goods to Russia that could be used in its war against Ukraine.\n\nCompanies making electronic components, which the EU believes could have military as well as civilian uses, were among 27 entities accused of \"directly supporting Russia's military and industrial complex in its war of aggression against Ukraine,\" a statement said.\n\nThose companies - some of them based in India, Sri Lanka, China, Serbia, Kazakhstan, Thailand and Turkey - face tougher export restrictions. The names of the companies will only be made public once they are published in the EU's official journal, which should be a matter of days.\n\nThe 27-nation bloc also said that it was targeting scores of Russian officials including \"members of the judiciary, local politicians and people responsible for the illegal deportation and military re-education of Ukrainian children.\"\n\nThe asset freezes and travel bans constitute the 13th package of measures imposed by EU against people and organisations it suspects of undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\n\nThe package was timed to mark the second anniversary of the Russian invasion.\n\n\"Today, we are further tightening the restrictive measures against Russia's military and defence sector,\" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said. \"We remain united in our determination to dent Russia's war machine and help Ukraine win its legitimate fight for self-defence.\" -- Euronews",

        "text": "What goes on in the collective consciousness of an enslaved, colonised, occupied or otherwise oppressed people's collective consciousness as they struggle to escape the slave-master's, the coloniser's, the occupier's or any other oppressor's boot long placed on their neck?\n\nSearch me, you say. I haven't got the foggiest idea, you add, about psychohistory, the discipline that seeks to interpret historical events with the aid of psychological theory. Go ask the victims of such abuse to tell you what the answer is.\n\nOK, I'm one such victim and I'll tell you -- as a Palestinian well over two million of whose people are, as we speak, enduring the most retributive assaults ever inflicted on a human community in modern times, an assault whose orgiastic frenzy shows no sign of let-up, one that has not just reshaped the politics of the broader Middle East and shaken world diplomacy but become an inflection point in history.\n\nSo, I'm glad you asked. To know what is going on in that collective consciousness you begin -- you must begin -- with those catastrophic events in 1948 that led to the dismemberment of Palestine and the dispersal of its people.\n\nAnd look, Palestinians do not see these events, which they call the Nakba, as a mere passing, albeit tragic, instant in their history, but rather as an epistemic framework through which they judge their condition in the present. The Nakba is a structure, an ongoing process -- like the \"structural racism\" endured by Black folks in America -- evidenced daily in the lives they live, whether under occupation or in exile, with the miseries of Gaza as its latest manifestation.\n\nIn short, the passions that animated our past continue to impact how we internalise the traumas of our present.\n\nRead more by Fawaz Turki How UNRWA empowered Palestinian refugees for generations Battle for truth in Gaza's media blockade Gaza's Apocalypse: Principle must trump realpolitik now\n\nThe past, as the bard put it, is prologue, which stands for the idea that a people's history sets the context for how these people reflect on their own meaning in the present. In the Manichean divide that separates occupier and occupied in Palestine, the occupier has tried and tried, and then tried some more, to strip Palestinians of their humanity, their agency, their sense of self, till there was nothing left in there that would've enabled them to link the actualities of their past to the potentialities of their future.\n\nThis is as good a time as any to bring in Frantz Fanon here, who remains as freshly relevant today as he was in the 1960s, and of whom a fascinating and scrupulously researched biography, The Rebel's Clinic: The Revolutionary Lives of Frantz Fanon, by Adam Shatz, was published earlier this month (though still no match to Irene Gendzier's 1973 Frantz Fanon: A Critical Study).\n\nFanon called this process of dehumanisation le processus de chosification, or the process of objectification, that is, the turning of a subjugated people into things, \"choses\" -- or, if you will, in the words of Yoav Gallant, Israel's defence minister, into \"human animals\".\n\nA domain of oppression\n\nThe reaction by the victims of this process, according to Fanon, is predictable -- they find themselves driven, at one \"extreme point\", to see the infliction of \"revolutionary violence\" on their tormentors as a redemptive act that \"cleanses\" the victim of his sense of shame, humiliation and inferiority. And, let's remember, Fanon was a psychiatrist who treated Algerians psychologically maimed by their colonial experience during the Algerian Revolution and thus was familiar with the psychopathology of colonialism as a domain of oppression.\n\nThis theoretical view by Fanon, which he advanced in his iconic work, The wretched of the Earth (Les Damnes de la Terre, 1961) was championed by Jean Paul Sartre in a preface he wrote for the book. A lot of public intellectuals, including Hannah Arendt at the time and in later years Edward Said took issue with it, though they seemed to agree with the contention -- not exclusively Fanon's -- that the violence committed by the slave to break his chains is of a different order from that committed by the slave-master to subdue him.\n\nThe \"extreme point\" referenced by Fanon comes at that juncture when the oppressed fail in convincing the oppressors that that are deserving of the right to human dignity and agency in their lives, an extreme point where, having failed to persuade by force of logic, they now will persuade by force of arms.\n\nRecall how in 1959, for example, in Guinea, the killing of striking dockworkers by Portuguese police had persuaded the poet and activist Amilcar Cabral to abandon diplomatic negotiations and embrace guerrilla warfare. The following year, Nelson Mandela, a disciple of Gandhi, led the African National Congress into armed struggle in response to a massacre of Black South Africans in Sharpville by the apartheid regime.\n\nThese revolutionaries posited their revolutionary violence as a kind of therapy, an antidote, as it were, to the poison secreted into their veins by those who chose to reduce their humanity to a fragment.\n\n\"As you and your fellowmen are cut down like dogs\", Mandela wrote at the time, addressing his people after the massacre who were abjectly living under apartheid, \"there's no other solution but to adopt every means available to re-establish your weight as human beings\".\n\nIn Palestine occupation is a sonorously sordid word that spans a whole gamut of villainy, yet that villainy is but a mere interlude in that saga we call the Nakba, a saga that tells of three generations of Palestinians who went from childhood to ripe consciousness as a deracinated people living in exile or as a subjugated people living with boots over their necks -- and in Gaza today with 2,000-pound \"bunker-buster\" bombs dropped on their heads.\n\nThis ongoing saga we call the Nakba is the landmark, the epistemic framework, I say, by which our culture, our habit of spirit and our conjectures on meaning find their bearings.\n\nIt is a landmark anchored in the belief, central in our Holy Texts, that for every oppressor a day will come.\n\n-- Fawaz Turki is a noted academic, journalist and author based in Washington DC.

        "title": "Wheat, rice and El Ni\u00f1o: food security warning lights are flashing red",
        "text": "A triple whammy of Russia's withdrawal from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, India's ban on rice exports and a powerful El Nino effect that will reduce yields has analysts and politicians warning of a new food crisis. / bne IntelliNews\n\nRussia's exit from the Black Sea grain initiative, India's ban on rice exports and a \"strong\" El Ni\u00f1o expected in the second half of this year mean the global food security warning lights have started to flash red.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has spilled over to affect global markets once again after the Kremlin pulled out of the Black Sea Grain Initiative on July 17, warning that any ship steaming towards one of Ukraine's port would be considered a military threat, and deploying a corsair warship to the waters to underscore this. Ukraine managed to export some 33mn tonnes of grain last year, but traders fear that the volume leaving the country this year will be radically reduced and could cause a fresh food crisis as supplies dwindle and prices soar.\n\nEmerging markets (EMs) are most exposed to the Kremlin's tough-man tactics. Ukraine claims that some 400mn are dependent on Ukraine's grain, but as bne IntelliNews reported, the physical volume of grain exported to Africa in particular from Ukraine is relatively small - a few million tonnes - while the bulk of the grain exports go to the EU and China, which is the biggest importer of Ukraine's grain.\n\nOut of the African nations, Egypt is amongst the most exposed.\n\nThe biggest importer of wheat in the world, the end of the Black Sea grain deal has exposed Egypt to rising global wheat prices which will add to strains within the country's balance of payments, force the government to cut non-subsidy spending and push up inflation. Egypt has already had to devalue three times and more food inflation could tip it into a fourth episode.\n\n\"Egypt is particularly vulnerable to developments in the wheat market. It is, after all, the world's largest wheat importer and, prior to the war, nearly 90% of its imports and around 45% of its total wheat needs came from Russia and Ukraine. (See Chart 1.) Clearly this leaves Egypt very exposed to supply disruptions. And, even if these are avoided, higher wheat prices will impact Egypt's economy through three key channels,\" Capital Economics said in a note.\n\nIf wheat prices remain at their current level, the country's wheat import bill is estimated to reach $2.5bn annually, lower than the $3.8bn spent in 2022, but still enough to put considerable pressure on the currency.\n\nTo mitigate some of the impact, Egypt has secured $100mn in financing from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and negotiations are underway to extend this facility by an additional $400mn, covering a significant portion of the estimated wheat import bill.\n\n\"Nonetheless, the bigger concern lies in the potential deterioration of the current account position, which could further strain the central bank's foreign exchange reserves. This may increase the likelihood of officials devaluing the pound in the coming months,\" says Capital Economics.\n\nThe situation may also force the government to reassess its fiscal plans. The subsidised bread programme, benefiting nearly 70% of the population, has faced challenges in the past, and officials shelved plans to rationalise it in 2022. While the subsidy bill is expected to be lower this fiscal year, high wheat prices could surpass the budgeted amount for FY2023/24. To maintain fiscal austerity goals, the government might have to consider curbing the programme or cutting spending elsewhere, although the former option could raise concerns over potential unrest.\n\nAnother consequence of rising wheat prices is the potential upward pressure on inflation. While the bread subsidy helps shield households from some of the impact, wheat products still constitute around 5% of the consumer price index (CPI) basket. With inflation already exceeding 35% year on year in June, the fastest pace in over 60 years, continued high wheat prices could keep inflation elevated for an extended period. In response, the central bank may need to resume its monetary tightening cycle and possibly adopt a more aggressive approach than initially envisaged. A new bout of food inflation would be particularly painful for Egypt.\n\nGrain price rise worse than lack of supply\n\nA shortage of grain is a problem but the effect on prices is much more damaging, hiking the cost of bread and making it unaffordable for many in the world's poorest markets - even if they are far away from Europe and do not import any Eastern European grain directly - that could tip millions into poverty or even starvation.\n\nThat scenario was avoided last year when Russia first imposed a naval blockade on Ukraine, partly because many poor could turn to another staple to replace the missing wheat: rice.\n\nRice supplies in 2022 were plentiful, so no one went short of food, but on July 20 India imposed a ban on the export of non-basmati rice in an effort to bring its domestic prices down after they soared by a third in the last year. As the world's biggest exporter of rice, the drop in Indian supplies could hit the international markets hard and catch the disadvantaged in between a pincher of a shortage of both rice and wheat.\n\nThe supply conundrum this year may be compounded by forecasts for an exceptionally strong El Ni\u00f1o effect in the second half of this year that could reduce yields in many of the world's poorest countries.\n\nThey are facing mounting risks to their food supply due to a combination of factors, including the likelihood of an El Ni\u00f1o event, the termination of the Black Sea grain deal and India's ban on non-basmati white rice exports. Countries in the Middle East and Africa are particularly vulnerable to lower grain supplies, and many EMs, especially in the Middle East, heavily rely on rice imports. The potential impact of these developments presents significant concerns for food security and could exacerbate external imbalances in North Africa.\n\nIn a recent update, we examined the potential consequences of El Ni\u00f1o on EMs, highlighting the threat of decreased production of vital commodities such as cocoa, sugar, coffee and rice in Africa and Asia. These disruptions pose a risk to food security in EMs, and these concerns have escalated further with recent developments. Russia's decision to withdraw from the Black Sea Grain Initiative, which allowed Ukraine to export agricultural products during the war, has significant implications. Additionally, India's announcement of a ban on all non-basmati white rice exports adds to the pressures on global food supplies.\n\n\"There are two key channels through which EMs could be impacted. One is via food supply. An El Ni\u00f1o-related drop in food production could reduce supplies in those EMs where food is produced and consumed (e.g. rice in Asia). Disruptions to food supplies could also impact those that depend most heavily on imports for their food needs, particularly if food-producing countries restrict exports to safeguard domestic supplies,\" Liam Peach, an emerging market economist with Capital Economics, said in a note on July 28.\n\nCapital Economics conducted an analysis of food security, comparing food import dependency and food self-sufficiency ratios (domestic production as a percentage of food supply) that revealed that wheat and other grain risks are most pronounced in the Middle East and Africa, amongst the world's most import-decedent countries.\n\nNotably, countries like Tunisia and Egypt are among the largest consumers of wheat globally, making them highly susceptible to the collapse of the Black Sea grain deal, as much of their wheat needs came from Russia or Ukraine before the war.\n\nUkraine is exploring alternatives so as to maintain its export volumes, but those leaving by rail and travelling to the EU have already been stymied after Poland and other Central European countries banned imports of Ukraine's grain earlier this year after their local wheat markets tanked due to the surfeit of cheap Ukrainian grain. The European Commission (EC) reaffirmed the ban and extended it for five months until September 15.\n\nAnother alternative route Ukraine has been developing is increasing exports via the Danube River, but in the last week Russia has begun to bomb port facilities servicing that route, which will also limit exports, leaving Kyiv with few alternatives.\n\nRussia itself enjoyed a all-time high record harvest of 153mn-155mn tonnes of grain last year and its grain silos are full to bursting. Russian exports are expected to climb to about 60mn tonnes this year, which will alleviate some of the pressure. During the African summit at the end of July Putin promised that six countries - Mali, Burkina Faso, Somalia, Zimbabwe, Eritrea and the Central African Republic, all amongst Moscow's staunchest allies - will get Russian grain for free to make up any shortfall there. Russia has been complaining about the limits to its own seaborne traffic that limits its ability to export.\n\n\"In other parts of Emerging Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, cocoa, coffee and rice are almost entirely reliant on imports. While these countries may not consume significant quantities of these foods, those with the lowest self-sufficiency and highest food imports per capita face the greatest risk of reduced food supplies. This includes countries like Saudi Arabia, Israel, Kuwait, Jordan and the UAE, particularly for wheat, corn, coffee and rice. Parts of Africa, too, heavily import rice from Asia, including from India,\" Peach reports.\n\nThe second channel through which EMs may be affected is via higher food prices. That means that countries that are heavily dependent on imports but import nothing from Russia or Ukraine may still be as badly hit by the food crisis as those countries buying their grain directly from those two countries.\n\nSo far, the market reaction has remained fairly modest as traders are expecting some sort of new deal to be thrashed out, according to Alexandra Prokopenko, an analyst with Carnegie in Berlin. Russian President Vladimir Putin has been hosting nearly all of Africa's leaders in St Petersburg this week and they have been lobbying for a resumption of the trade. Turkey too is exerting pressure on the Kremlin to restart shipping, as it is a major importer of Russian and Ukrainian grain and the world's biggest exporter of flour.\n\n\"While revisions to commodity forecasts are currently underway, it is expected that most changes will be modest. There is no clear indication that a substantial reduction in supply and a spike in prices is inevitable,\" says Peach. \"In fact, forecasts suggest that most commodity prices will fall in the coming months, with wheat, coffee and cocoa prices expected to decline while rice prices experience a slight increase. The S&P GSCI agricultural price index is projected to decline by around 15% by year-end.\"\n\nAnalysts say there is no direct relationship between global agricultural prices and EM food inflation; nevertheless, it is expected that if prices remain at current levels, last year's food inflation shock will continue to pass through, resulting in a further decline in EM food inflation over the coming months, says Peach.\n\n\"Nevertheless, the impact of supply disruptions would take time to filter through, and at this stage, it remains a risk rather than an embedded factor in inflation forecasts,\" Peach added.\n\nIn conclusion, the risks to food supply in emerging markets have increased dramatically, but a food crisis is not a given. While the full extent of the impact remains uncertain, policymakers are already working to head off a bigger disaster and ensure a stable and sustainable food supply chain for these economies.",

Since then, more than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nBut Israel's war needs have not conflicted with its defence supplies to India, the Israeli source and the senior Indian military official said. Israel's operations have created a growing need for ammunition, but not radars of the type it is exporting to India, the Israeli source said.\n\n\"We made sure our (military) exports to India are not impacted,\" he said. The Indian official said Israel had ensured a steady supply of weapons bought by New Delhi, which also include drone components.\n\nBoth sources spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject. India's foreign ministry and the Israeli embassy in New Delhi did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWith a strong presence at the Singapore Airshow, Israeli arms manufacturers are back at international events after an absence following the start of the war in Gaza. India is the world's largest arms importer, buying $37 billion worth between 2012 and 2022, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.\n\nIsrael is the fourth largest supplier of military hardware to India, which has bought weapons worth $21.8 billion from Russia, $5.2 billion from France and $4.5 billion from America in the last decade. India has been trying to reduce its dependence on Russian weapons by diversifying purchases to countries such as France and Israel, and boosting its nascent domestic arms manufacturing industry.\n\nIsrael's Elbit Systems partners with Indian conglomerate Adani group to manufacture some of its Hermes900 drones at a facility in southern India, which are exported back to Israel for its use.\n\n(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",

        "text": "New Delhi [India], February 23 (ANI): Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra strongly condemned the Israeli actions -- without naming Israel -- in the Gaza Strip, saying that the \"genocide\" has set a \"horrendous precedent\" and will go down as a \"great shame\" in the history of the human race.\n\nIn a social media post, the Congress general secretary cited the incidents of bombing on hospitals and alleged cases of torture against doctors in Gaza. She also raised concern over funding and arms being provided to the \"oppressive regime\" in Israel.\n\nThe ongoing Israel-Hamas war, which started after the October 7 attacks, has created rampages in the Gaza Strip, leading to a \"humanitarian crisis\" in the enclave.\n\nTaking to social media platform X, Priyanka Gandhi said, \"What the international community has allowed in Gaza will go down in history not only as a great shame for the whole of humanity, but as a turning point for the human race.\"She said that the world is 'blind' to the \"genocide\" being carried out in the Gaza Strip and no one is stepping in even when an 'entire nation' is \"begging for help\".\n\n\"Being blind to genocide as it is carried out with impunity, turning our backs to the merciless slaughter of thousands of innocent children, refusing to step in while an entire nation starves and begs for help, while hospitals are bombed, doctors tortured and humiliated, and patients allowed to die, enabling an oppressive regime by offering its ships our ports, fueling its inhumane rampage by providing it with more and more funding and arms - all this has now set a horrendous precedent,\" she further stated.\n\nPriyanka also said that everyone will have to pay an \"unimaginable price\" for this if voices are not raised against it.\n\n\"All rules of justice, humanity and international decorum have been broken. Humanity has been bled, and each one of us will pay an unimaginable price for this some day unless we raise our voices and stand up for what is right today,\" she added.\n\nNotably, the Congress party has consistently weighed strong support for the people of Palestine ever since the conflict erupted.\n\nIn October last year, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) passed a resolution supporting the rights of the Palestinian people and calling for a ceasefire in the region.\n\nThe party had also condemned the Hamas attack, stating that a solution can never be reached through any type of violence.\n\nThe conflict in Gaza escalated after Hamas carried out a massive terror attack against Israel on October 7, killing over 1200 people, taking around 250 people hostage and even committing sexual assault against civilians.\n\nIn response, Israel launched a strong counteroffensive targeting the Hamas terror units in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsraeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has said that the war will continue until Hamas is \"destroyed\", the Times of Israel reported.\n\n\"We're continuing the war to the end,\" Netanyahu said in a statement to the media. \"Until all the goals we set are met: destroying Hamas, releasing our hostages and removing the threat from Gaza.\"However, the Israeli air assault and ground operations has drawn frowns from rights groups and the Arab world over the mounting civilian death toll.\n\nAccording to Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, over 29,000 people have been killed in the Israeli attacks including more than 12,000 children.\n\nThe Israeli onslaught has displaced around 85 per cent of Gaza's population amid acute shortages of food, clean water and medicine, while 6 per cent infrastructure has been damaged or destroyed, according to the United Nations.\n\nUN experts have even declared Israel's actions in Gaza to be tantamount to \"crimes against humanity.\"Meanwhile, a case is also underway at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) where South Africa has accused Israel of \"committing genocide\" in Gaza.\n\nThe ICJ, although didn't order an 'immediate ceasefire', but did direct Israel to take \"every measure possible to avoid genocide\" while also ensuring humanitarian aid, Al Jazeera reported.

The sanctions represent the largest single tranche of penalties since Russia's invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.

During Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel, militants killed about 1,200 people and took some 250 hostages. Roughly half of the hostages were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November. About 100 hostages remain in captivity, in addition to the bodies of 30 others who were killed in the October incursion or died in captivity.

Nearly five months into the war that began with Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel, the hostages' relatives hold on to hope that they will be freed. But they're growing increasingly desperate for a resolution. After multiple failed rounds of negotiations, the hostages' relatives fret that both Israelis and the world are losing interest in their struggle. Roughly 250 people, including women, children and older adults, were taken as hostages on Oct. 7, and more than 100 have been freed so far. Of the 134 remaining hostages, Israel believes 100 or so are still alive.\n\nPrivate lander makes first US moon landing in more than 50 years\n\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.

Intuitive Machines' lander touched down Thursday, but left flight controllers scrambling before gaining better contact. Tension mounted in the company's Houston control center when there was no immediate word from the lander following the designated touchdown time. A faint signal finally was acquired.

Alexander Smirnov had been released with a GPS monitor ahead of trial. He was arrested during a meeting Thursday morning at his lawyers' offices in downtown Las Vegas. The arrest came after prosecutors asked a judge in California, where the case originally was filed, to reconsider Smirnov's custody status while he awaits trial. He is charged with making a false statement and creating a false and fictitious record.\n\nTrump's lawyers call for dismissal of classified documents case, citing presidential immunity\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump's legal team has filed multiple motions urging a Florida judge to dismiss the criminal case charging him with illegally retaining classified documents. They claim in part that presidential immunity protects him from prosecution -- an argument they have already submitted to the U.S. Supreme Court in his election interference case. Trump faces dozens of felony counts in federal court in Florida accusing him of illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them.

That alliance appears to be cracking just ahead of general elections in which Modi is eyeing a third consecutive term in power. Riven by internal rivalries, political defections and lack of agreements on seat-sharing, the opposition is disintegrating at a time when Modi's popularity has surged after he opened a Hindu temple in northern Ayodhya city, fulfilling his party's long-held Hindu nationalist pledge.

Trump faces dozens of felony counts in federal court in Florida accusing him of illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate and obstructing government efforts to retrieve them. The case is currently set for trial on May 20, but that date could be pushed back.\n\nAT&T says the outage to its US cellphone network was not caused by a cyberattack\n\nAT&T says the hourslong outage to its U.S. cellphone network appeared to be the result of a technical error, not a malicious attack. The Dallas-based company blamed the outage Thursday on an error in coding while it was expanding its network, without elaborating. It restored wireless coverage after the outage knocked out cellphone service on its network across the U.S. Outage tracker Downdetector noted that outages began at about 3:30 a.m. ET and peaked at around 73,000 reported incidents. AT&T had more than 58,000 outages around noon ET, in locations including Houston, Atlanta and Chicago. The carrier has more than 240 million subscribers, the country's largest. By 8 p.m. ET, the outage reports on AT&T's network were down to fewer than 1,000.\n\nCollapse of illegal gold mine in Venezuela lays bare feelings of abandonment in rural communities\n\nLA PARAGUA, Venezuela (AP) -- The collapse of an illegally operated gold mine in a remote area of central Venezuela has laid bare the sense of abandonment that plagues communities across the South American country. La Paragua is the closest community to the open-pit Bulla Loca mine, where dozens of men and women worked at any given time, and residentss repeatedly expressed frustration with the government as funerals for victims began Thursday. At least 16 people were killed in one of the worst accidents in Venezuela's poorly regulated mining industry.\n\nThe opposition alliance that aimed to oust Modi appears to be cracking just before India's elections\n\nNEW DELHI (AP) -- India's beleaguered opposition parties, which are beset with ideological differences and personality clashes, joined hands last year to unseat popular Prime Minister Narendra Modi and defeat his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's electoral juggernaut. That alliance appears to be cracking just ahead of general elections in which Modi is eyeing a third consecutive term in power. Riven by internal rivalries, political defections and lack of agreements on seat-sharing, the opposition is disintegrating at a time when Modi's popularity has surged after he opened a Hindu temple in northern Ayodhya city, fulfilling his party's long-held Hindu nationalist pledge. National elections in India are expected over a period of staggered voting in April and May.",

        "title": "Trapping The USA And Its Allies: A New Strategy Of Forcing Dispersed Fielding Of Forces - Bharat Shakti",
        "text": "Conflicts are raging in different continents and engulf the waters of various seas. While Ukraine finds no resolution, there is no method found as yet to douse the flames in Gaza, either. Meanwhile, the Houthis tie down disproportionate forces, even as Somali pirates strike repeatedly. In all these chaos, the US and NATO forces have intervened, testing their resilience amidst wide spread deployments. Is this all in accordance with a gameplan of a set of nations to stretch the west, and prepare to address their own larger objectives.\n\n..........................................................................................\n\nThe world is transiting through challenging times. After having faced the devastating impact of Covid-19, multiple regional conflicts are emerging with the potential to not only engulf the respective regions but also to spread beyond and cast a shadow on most parts of the world. Though appearing as unconnected dots, there is a deep-rooted strategy by some nations in instigating these conflicts and related events. Further, most of these conflicts have no end in sight. An analysis of relevant issues is called for.\n\nPost WW II, two super powers had emerged: the USA and USSR. These two countries, despite being on the same side in WW II, propagated two distinct philosophies that opposed each other. While the USA believes in the Democratic form of governance, USSR believed in the Communist form of governance. A Cold War continued between these two super powers with USA creating the NATO and USSR creating the Warsaw Pact military affiliations. The cold war state diminished in 1991 when USSR disintegrated and Russia emerged as its prime successor. However, the two super powers still continued in the form of USA and Russia. Gradually, the world turned UNIPOLAR and the USA emerged occupied the citadel.\n\nThe USA has been projecting its power in almost all parts of the world. It interjected its forces majorly in Afghanistan in 2001. It was after two decades in Afghanistan, that USA decided to withdraw its forces in a hurried manner on 30 Aug 2021 without adequate protection either for its own security forces, or the Government in power in Kabul which was on the verge of collapsing. Taliban expectedly advanced and assumed power on 15 August 2021.The faith that many nations had deposed in the USA as a nation capable of keeping the world stable, eroded.\n\nThe rivalry of USA and Russia kept sharpening with the USA trying to forge stronger ties with NATO countries whereas Russia, intent on assuming the role of successor of USSR, was also busy in expanding its influence; even annexation of territories in the odd case, Crimea in 2014 being one such act. China, another communist country, which had initially advocated a multi polar world as against unipolar or bipolar world, shifted its strategy and started making efforts to become the top super power globally. It had already taken steps to boost its economy, technological progress and militarily to be counted on the global stage.\n\nWhen Trump assumed presidency of USA on 20 January 2017, he started reducing the US footprints from different regions of the world guided by the policy of 'America First'. Withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan was a manifestation of this policy. This changed profile of US was closely being watched both by Russia and China. China also observed the emergence of Japan championing the cause of Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD), a grouping of four nations to include US, Japan, India and Australia. Incidentally, China has adversarial relations with all these four countries. It was time now for China and Russia to play their cards to dissipate the growing power of USA and its allies on the world stage.\n\nAs far as India was concerned, it was China that made the first move wherein it transgressed at a number of locations in the Eastern Ladakh in Apr-May 2020 totally disregarding all mutual treaties related to peace and tranquillity. Besides other reasons of this transgression, one of the prime reasons was putting pressure on India to distance itself from its increasing affiliation and tilt towards USA. China considers US as the number 1 opponent as it is only country in the world which can oppose China militarily to prevent annexation of Taiwan as an integral part of China. US has also been taking measures to keep India on its side as it knows for sure that it cannot checkmate China without direct support of India. By undertaking these transgressions and continuing with them till close to four years now, China has foreclosed any other option India may have exercised. The US, in any case, has no other option of strengthening its response against China but through Indian collaboration.\n\nIn February 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine due to its perceived security concerns. It was easy to observe the nexus between Russia and China at this stage wherein the 'special operations' by Russia were launched after conclusion of Beijing Olympics. It was at this point of time when 'No limit' friendship between Russia and China got connected with the unquestionable aim of weakening US and its allies. Though Russia-Ukraine war is continuing now for over two years and has resulted in serious inadequacies getting exposed of the Russian side as well, it has been draining the military and financial resources of USA and all its NATO allies substantially with no end in its sight.\n\nRussia-China game plan has been also gathered strength from the Hamas-Israel war which commenced on 7 October2023 and is continuing till date. USA has been supporting Israel and has started committing its defence and financial resources. In the process, US is getting trapped in newer conflicts without the earlier ones getting over. This canvas has widened with Houthi rebels based in Yemen attacking the merchant shipping passing through 'Red Sea' route, one of the busiest trade routes globally.\n\nThough US announced a coalition to respond to the security needs of 'Red Sea' transit route on 19 December 2023 it started launching operations only in January 2024. It's possible that Iran and other West Asian nations may join this conflict in some way or the other either to oppose Israel or USA, both of these conditions are favourable to Russia-China axis as they are successfully dissipating US and their allies. This traps do not appear to have been noted.\n\nHaving dissipated US and its allies forces from Europe to West Asia, Russia-China appear to have played their master stroke wherein North Korea has started its aggressive actions, apparently against South Korea, but primarily aimed at USA. The USA is bound to respond to protect South Korea due to its security agreements. If this happens, the dispersion of USA will be so far and widespread that it will lead to a status of 'Advantage Russia-China'.\n\nSuch conditions can then be leveraged by China to integrate Taiwan militarily. Taiwan's airspace and maritime control are being violated by China on a regular basis which are indicators of the events unfolding. The recent presidential elections in Taiwan have resulted in election of Lai Ching-te as the new president of Taiwan who is known for pro democratic and independent status of Taiwan. Given the statement of Xi Jinping in January2024, the possibility of forceful integration of Taiwan cannot be ruled out.\n\nIt is evident that from the year 2020 onwards, year after year, deliberate actions are being taken by Russia and China to weaken US and its allies with the aim of forcing them to disperse their power all over. The real test lies in the waters of Pacific; waiting to unfold.",

        "title": "IS THE THIRD WORLD WAR ALREADY UNDERWAY? - Russia News Now",
        "text": "The escalating frequency of global military conflicts, the flouting of international laws by various actors, the swift dissemination of information from battlefronts enabling ordinary individuals to virtually participate in conflicts on the other side of the world\u200a -- \u200aall contribute to heightening public apprehension about an imminent Third World War and a growing sense of its inevitability. However, in reality, such a war is already underway, whether in a covert or overt form.\n\nA retrospective analysis of world history reveals a pattern where shifts in socio-economic structures, driven by antagonistic contradictions between outdated industrial relations and emerging production forces, culminate in major wars. These wars typically follow a sequence of scattered local conflicts and events, mirroring historical precedents. For instance, Napoleon's 19th-century war, akin to a world war in its scale, was preceded by a series of \"revolutionary wars.\"\n\nSimilarly, the precursor to the First World War was a series of local conflicts, including the Balkan wars in Europe in 1912 and 1913. Stalin, in the lead-up to the Second World War, interpreted Britain's rupture of relations with the USSR in 1927 as the first signal. Despite the Great Depression delaying the conflict, Western industrial and financial elites are documented to have fostered Hitler's Nazism to curb communism and dismantle the USSR.\n\nThe onset of the Second World War saw the destruction of the Versailles-Washington system, and the signing of the Rome Pact equated defeated Germany with victorious nations. Violating the Treaty of Versailles, Germany re-established its navy in 1935 and remilitarized the Rhineland, its industrial hub, in 1936.\n\nFascism, initially nurtured by its creators, turned against them, leading the United States and Great Britain to unite with the Soviet Union to defeat Hitler. Despite this, plans for the nuclear bombing of Soviet cities were underway as the Red Army raised flags on the Reichstag.\n\nThe post-World War II Potsdam system of international relations began to deteriorate in the 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union and completely crumbled following the bombing of Yugoslavia. Calls for a new system governed by international law were repeatedly made by world leaders, including Putin's 2007 speech in Munich, but no concerted efforts were made to establish one.\n\nThe emergence of a unipolar world and the epoch of U.S. global dominance have dawned, supposedly casting the beacon of \"freedom\" across the entire planet. However, this flame has also sparked conflicts in ten countries during the initial two decades of the twenty-first century.\n\nThe events unfolding since the turn of the century, encompassing 9/11, the U.S. intervention in Afghanistan, the Iraq War, the Libyan bombing, the conflict in Georgia, the Arab Spring, Brexit, the coup d'etat, and the resurgence of Nazism in Ukraine, the global phenomenon of international jihad, the war in Yemen, and the ongoing pandemic, collectively appear to be ominous precursors of an impending Third World War.\n\nAs we reflect on the developments of 2023, compelling evidence suggests the emergence of new power centers amidst continuous global transformations, indicative of the waning influence of the unipolar world. The genesis of these power shifts not only incites but will likely perpetuate conflicts. The root cause of these tumultuous processes can be traced to the United States' unwillingness and incapacity to acknowledge the erosion of its once unchallenged global hegemony.\n\nLeading nations like Russia, China, Iran, and India, as well as regional influencers such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia, alongside the governments of Africa and Central Asia\u200a -- \u200acollectively referred to as the \"majority of the world\" in contemporary terms\u200a -- \u200aare no longer content with merely aligning with U.S. global interests outlined in Washington's doctrinal documents. Instead, they aspire to assert their independent voices in addressing international issues and demand acknowledgment of their national sovereignty. This inherent contradiction sets the stage for potential wars or a second, and hopefully decisive, wave of decolonization.\n\nThe ongoing conflicts are fueled by the competition for global resources and spheres of influence among these emerging power centers. Unfortunately, these conflicts have become the regrettable yet seemingly unavoidable means of addressing longstanding issues that persist despite the advancements of modern technology and AI. Even in this era, the resolution of matters unfortunately still relies on the application of military force.\n\nExemplifying this point is the conflict in Transcaucasia, as evidenced by the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh. Ongoing tensions also include the conflict between NATO and Russia in Ukraine, as well as the sustained hostilities between the Israeli army and Palestinian resistance forces in the Gaza Strip.\n\nAn illustrative case of persistent disregard for U.N. resolutions can be observed in Azerbaijan, where Armenian-Karabakh forces have maintained occupation of seven regions for over three decades. The non-implementation of the U.N. resolution, demanding the immediate, complete, and unconditional withdrawal of occupying forces, coupled with challenges in repatriating Azerbaijani refugees and a continuous deferral of addressing the core issue\u200a -- \u200athe status of Nagorno-Karabakh\u200a -- \u200ahas forced Baku, supported strongly by Turkey, to seek a forceful resolution to the Karabakh matter.\n\nThe West's consistent dismissal of Russia's concerns about increasing threats to its national security from NATO, along with Ukraine losing its neutral status after the 2014 coup orchestrated by the United States, prompted Moscow to initiate a special military operation, ultimately evolving into a conflict in the heart of Europe.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of the Gaza Strip, Israel's neglect of Palestinians' aspirations for their own sovereign state, the lack of substantial improvements in the enclave's conditions post the Abraham Accords, provocations at the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the forced displacement of Palestinian families from East Jerusalem, and Netanyahu's U.N. General Assembly speech in September\u200a -- \u200awhere he presented a map of the Middle East excluding Palestine\u200a -- \u200acompelled HAMAS to elevate the issue of establishing an independent Palestinian state to the realm of practical politics.\n\nAll the contradictions of the world\u200a -- \u200apolitical, national, financial, religious\u200a -- \u200aare concentrated and most clearly manifested now in the Gaza Strip. This is evident in the extensive involvement of all countries, global media, and numerous demonstrations worldwide in support of Palestine.\n\nThe contradictions inherent in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict can be deemed among the most profound. It represents a war of meanings, where extremities and fanaticism are pushed to their limits. The dichotomies of \"white\" or \"black,\" \"for\" or \"against,\" victory or death leave no room for a third option. Some are unable to forget anything since the Nakba of 1948, while others recall only October 7, 2023. The dilemma of the existence of the Al Aqsa Mosque or the construction of a Third Temple becomes an altar for the sacrifice of human lives, both Arab and Jewish.\n\nThe sin of anti-Semitism is severely condemned when directed against Jews, yet it is often overlooked that Arabs are also Semites. Transnational capital staunchly defends Israel's right to \"self-defense,\" sending Israeli soldiers, mobilized from around the world, to their deaths in HAMAS tunnels, all while meticulously calculating future profits from the development of the vast Leviathan gas field discovered off the coast of Gaza. Corporate media, which mourned extensively for five hundred children killed in two years of fighting in Ukraine, casually mentions over ten thousand Palestinian children who died under Israeli carpet bombing, not to mention those injured, trapped under rubble, or suffering from malnutrition.\n\nPro-Israeli journalists seem to ignore that in seven weeks, the IDF destroyed twice as many buildings in northern Gaza as were destroyed in three years of military operations in Aleppo, Syria. They are already gearing up to produce triumphant reports on the construction of a beautiful new kibbutzim on the shores of historic Palestine, where, alongside Jewish settlers from around the world, the ghosts of deceased Palestinians will supposedly live forever.\n\nHistorically, Israeli authorities supported the establishment of HAMAS, initially presented as a charitable organization focused on religious education and social assistance. Tel Aviv perceived the Palestine Liberation Organization, led by Yasser Arafat and encompassing both Muslims and Christians with the goal of national independence, as a greater threat to Israel. Consequently, HAMAS was created and empowered in the Gaza Strip by the CIA and Israel to splinter the national movement for the liberation of Palestine.\n\nEssentially, Netanyahu and the far-right Zionists he represents consistently needed an enemy to justify the demolition of Palestinian villages and the construction of new Jewish settlements in the occupied territories.\n\nSimilarly, in Syria, international jihad became an instrument of regime change policy in the fight against President Assad. The Ukrainian army was reformatted into a NATO proxy army in the war with Russia. In all three cases\u200a -- \u200awith HAMAS, ISIS, and the Armed Forces of Ukraine\u200a -- \u200atechnologies of radicalization of national and religious consciousness were employed. Perhaps the ideology of Zionism can also be included in this series, as Israel and its policy towards neighboring Arab countries are viewed as instruments of the West's colonial policy in the Middle East. Therefore, Israel is not at war with HAMAS; it is a war of the ideology of Zionism with the civilizations of Islam and Orthodoxy.\n\nThe New York Times has reported that President Biden is preparing to resume selling advanced offensive weapons to Saudi Arabia, despite facing opposition from Congress. This decision comes amid Riyadh's attempts to negotiate a permanent reconciliation agreement with the Houthis. The Biden administration's move appears to indicate a reluctance for successful peace talks between Saudi Arabia and Yemen, as it may contribute positively to the growing rapprochement between Riyadh and Tehran. This geopolitical shift, facilitated by China's mediation, challenges the long-standing enmity between the two, contrary to Washington's preferences, given Iran's perceived status as a primary adversary in the region.\n\nIsrael also seems disinclined towards the unification of its regional rivals. Against the backdrop of the ongoing Gaza genocide, there is a notable shift in the position of the leader of the Persian Gulf monarchies, who was on the verge of signing the Abraham Agreement just before October 7. A joint statement by China, Iran, and Saudi Arabia, following a trilateral meeting, emphasizes an immediate cessation of military operations in the Gaza Strip, sustained aid to the civilian population, and opposition to the forced displacement of Palestinians. The statement underscores the insistence that the future of Palestine must reflect the will of the Palestinian people.\n\nThese developments suggest that a world war is already underway in various arenas, encompassing not only informational battles but also real-world conflicts on land and sea. This global struggle unfolds between the hypothetical Global North (West) and Global South (East).\n\nIn the current scenario, the Houthis, erstwhile adversaries of Saudi Arabia, are now targeting merchant ships in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. This has led major logistics companies to cease supplying cargo through the Red Sea, a critical route for about 14 percent of global sea shipments, nearly 30 percent of container shipments, and approximately 5 percent of global oil transportation. International shipping is hampered, even in the presence of NATO naval groups operating in the region.\n\nThe actions of Yemeni rebels appear strategic rather than spontaneous, raising questions about the motivations behind their recent activities. Meanwhile, as Western ships circumvent the Cape of Good Hope, Russian and Chinese vessels navigate the Red Sea unhindered, adhering to the condition of avoiding Israel\u200a -- \u200aa consistent implementation of the \"One Belt and One Road\" initiative.\n\nWhile global attention focuses on Israel, the diversion aids the Kremlin's confidence in pursuing its goals, despite significant economic losses in Israel. The Israeli economy is already reported to have suffered preliminary damages of $55 billion if military operations in the Gaza Strip persist into 2024.\n\nAmid these developments, The Wall Street Journal reports that the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) allegedly provides weapons, including missiles and drones, to the Houthis. However, the rebels deny this, emphasizing the role of their own intelligence services.\n\nThe United States announces Operation Transparency Guardian, involving ten countries to ensure freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. However, some European nations decline to transfer their warships under American command, reflecting a broader geopolitical landscape.\n\nIn summary, the ongoing conflict, particularly with the Yemeni rebels blocking key maritime routes, forces of the Operation Transparency Guardian regularly bombing them, and with simultaneous movement of Israeli army units to the border with Lebanon aiming to clash with Hezbollah, poses a risk of escalating the local IDF conflict with Palestinian resistance forces into a broader, strategic global war.\n\nThe military conflicts observed since the commencement of the twenty-first century carry the potential to escalate from localized disputes to a global scale, potentially leading to the eruption of the third world war. A mounting concern revolves around the increasing number of nations expressing intentions to acquire nuclear weapons. Beyond the purview of military experts, ordinary individuals consuming news about countries withdrawing from arms control treaties may unknowingly harbor a sense of fear and anxiety. The perception that the world is becoming unhinged due to an unrestrained proliferation of weapons is amplified by a myriad of opinions and forecasts, not always of professional origin, circulating on the internet and social networks. Official news sources do little to assuage these concerns.\n\nFor instance, on the same day that the Russian State Duma passed a law annulling the ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, information surfaced on the internet about the U.S. Department of Energy reporting underground tests conducted at the Nevada test site, previously employed for nuclear weapons testing. Preceding this, the U.S. military declared its intent to develop a new nuclear bomb, surpassing the power of the one dropped on Hiroshima in August 1945 by more than 20 times.\n\nIndeed, the United States conducted examinations of the global monitoring system, equipped with seismic sensors capable of swiftly detecting indications not only of earthquakes and natural disasters but also of human-made disasters and emergency incidents. These tests aim to simulate a nuclear explosion, allowing for the anticipation and prevention of its potential consequences. It appears that the inaccurate information about the supposed nuclear test at the Nevada test site may have originated from such simulations. Had an actual test occurred, the global response would likely have been different, with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) playing a significant role.\n\nIn a similar vein, during the onset of the Ukrainian war last year, certain individuals in Russia, led by a controversial State Duma deputy, issued threats to the world involving an inflatable Sarmat rocket. More recently, Israeli Heritage Minister Eliyahu openly acknowledged Tel Aviv's possession of nuclear weapons, even suggesting the possibility of deploying a nuclear bomb on the Gaza Strip. When confronted with such news, an ordinary individual may perceive the looming inevitability of a nuclear catastrophe.\n\nRecently, the Turkish president has urged for the control of Israel's nuclear weapons \"before it is too late,\" thereby intensifying the discourse on the public acknowledgment of Israel's possession of nuclear arms. Erdogan's statement coincided with the U.N. conference on establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, held in New York. Regrettably, Israel remains indifferent to discussions regarding the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nNonetheless, there is a crucial ongoing dialogue aimed at fostering trust among the countries in the region. Initiated in 2018 under the auspices of the United Nations after years of unsuccessful attempts, this dialogue seeks to advance a ban on the use of weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. Achieving this objective is undoubtedly challenging without the active participation of Israel and the United States, both of which have repeatedly blocked the adoption of relevant resolutions in the U.N. Security Council. However, the difficulty of the task does not diminish its significance.\n\nThe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), a cornerstone agreement in the domain of international security and strategic stability, has effectively upheld peace for several decades since its inception in 1968. Currently, 190 countries are parties to the NPT, with noteworthy exceptions including Israel, India, Pakistan, and South Sudan. North Korea withdrew from the NPT in 2003, citing it as a protest against the violation of its sovereignty. Both Russia and the United States, inheriting their nuclear powers from the USSR, have ratified the NPT.\n\nHowever, recent developments have posed challenges to the commitment to non-proliferation. Russia, for example, withdrew its ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), while the United States has not ratified it at all. Moscow's decision was a response to the U.S. withdrawal from various bilateral treaties and the termination of the \"nuclear deal\" with Iran. Consequently, this has increased the temptation for other countries to pursue nuclear weapons. The core principle of the NPT, aimed at curbing the nuclear arms race, appears difficult to enforce. Nevertheless, this does not imply that the international community lacks mechanisms to mitigate such risks.\n\nBuilding upon the foundation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), over 93 countries signed and 69, constituting more than one-third of the world's states, ratified the Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone (NWFZ) agreement\u200a -- \u200athe Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in 2017. Under this treaty, signatory nations commit to \"never and under no circumstances\" develop, test, produce, or stockpile nuclear weapons. Additionally, they pledge not to use or threaten to use such weapons and are prohibited from hosting nuclear weapons of other states on their territories.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the members of the \"nuclear club\"\u200a -- \u200athe United States, Russia, China, Great Britain, France, India, Pakistan, North Korea, and Israel\u200a -- \u200achose not to engage in the creation of this document. In fact, the United States, Great Britain, and France collectively announced their intention never to become signatories to the treaty. Similarly, Russia abstained from signing, stating that it conflicts with the national interests of the country.\n\nUnfortunately, the sole dismantling of nuclear weapons will not suffice to tackle the challenges of global strategic security. Despite their formidable capabilities, it might appear paradoxical, but the possession of nuclear weapons by two major powers, the United States and the USSR, acted as a deterrent, playing a crucial role in preventing World War III in the 20th century.\n\nThe current international relations system is evidently driven not by trust and a sense of responsibility but rather by the demonstration of military strength and the fear of mutual destruction. Nonetheless, this reality should not discourage the exploration of mechanisms and concepts that can play a role in halting the nuclear arms race in the future. As nuclear powers, currently involved in reshaping spheres of influence, inevitably engage in negotiations, the discussions must center around defining the future structure of the world, the role of weapons of mass destruction, measures to deter their use, and, on a broader scale, the establishment of a global architecture of indivisible security.\n\nThe global populace's reaction, manifested through widespread protests numbering in the tens of thousands, stands as the sole factor capable of influencing the situation in Gaza. The collective sentiments, whether positive or negative, contribute to a general tension since we all inhabit the same interconnected energy space of the Earth, ultimately influencing events and the course of history.\n\nShifts in attitudes towards Israeli policy are also observable in the United States. Even before October 7, major corporate media outlets, traditionally seen as not entirely impartial, began adjusting their tone in discussions surrounding the Palestinian issue. Presently, Palestinian perspectives find space on the front pages of publications like \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post,\" and Palestinian voices are featured on television channels.\n\nGlobally, organizations with names akin to \"Not On My Name\" are emerging, predominantly comprising young Jews who are incensed by Israel's policies. It appears that following the conflict in Gaza, their ranks will likely swell. Over the past three to four years, prominent international human rights organizations like Amnesty International and The Human Rights Watch, alongside key Israeli human rights entities such as B'Tselem and others, have increasingly addressed the Palestinian issue. They have concluded that Israel is in violation of the international Covenant and anti-apartheid laws. These organizations have acknowledged that Palestinian refugees or exiles, residing globally and denied their internationally guaranteed right to return to their homes, are also victims of the crime of apartheid.\n\nThis acknowledgment has had a profound impact on public opinion within the media, among members of Congress, and among the clergy. The rise of the Jewish Voice for Peace movement is also noteworthy. It is currently the fastest-growing movement, boasting around 20,000 subscribers and approximately 300,000 regular supporters online, an unprecedented development that carries significant importance.\n\nThe Israeli Defence Forces' ethnic cleansing of the civilian population in Gaza has mobilized legal associations globally, forming an army of over 300 lawyers and human rights defenders. They are preparing to accuse the Netanyahu government of war crimes, a move mirrored by certain states.\n\nAmidst this, Palestinian Christians are urging their Muslim compatriots to unite and avoid turning the struggle for a national state into a religious war, recognizing the potential harm to their common cause. Within Israel, there are factions both in favor of and against the continuation of the war. Those advocating for a just and peaceful resolution for both peoples, calling for an end to the endless and senseless violence that is undermining the future of both Israelis and Palestinians, exist on both sides. The destiny of living side by side with mutual recognition of their human and national rights seems to have been overshadowed by a prevailing sentiment reminiscent of Cain, the biblical figure who was the first to shed his brother's blood thousands of years ago.\n\nNumerous countries worldwide endorse adherence to the UN resolution calling for the creation of two states and the return of Palestine to its 1967 borders. However, practical questions arise. Would Jordan and Egypt be amenable to altering their current borders in this scenario? Additionally, how would the more than 700,000 foreign settlers, residing in illegally constructed Israeli \"kibbutzim\" for decades, be addressed? Some Palestinians and Israelis suggest an alternative approach: establishing a single state, named the Holy Land, with Jerusalem as its capital\u200a -- \u200aa proposition that resonates with the shared heritage of three world religions.\n\nVarious entities, including Sunni Turkey, Shiite Iran, the Catholic Vatican, and Orthodox Russia, have condemned Israel's actions. Elon Musk, during an interview with Lex Friedman, expressed the view that killing one child in Gaza could potentially create several individuals who may join HAMAS and seek retaliation against Israelis. This perspective applies to victims on both sides, as each casualty can fuel a desire for revenge. Investigations in Israeli media outlets, such as Yedioth Ahronoth and Haaretz, have uncovered instances implicating Israeli security forces in harming Israeli settlers and festival attendees.\n\nUnfortunately, the cycle of hatred may persist, with Arabs and Jews passing it down through generations. This dynamic is not limited to specific nationalities, religions, genders, or social affiliations but can be cultivated intentionally and consistently.\n\nThe global resonance of the Palestinian issue extends beyond considerations of land, nationality, or religion. It has become a universal moral benchmark, emblematic of justice. The image of a child confronting an Israeli tank symbolizes Palestinian resistance and serves as a litmus test for human ethics. The prevailing sentiment often leans towards empathy for the child.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan rightly pointed out that remaining silent in the face of Israel's actions in Gaza could be interpreted as giving the green light to lawlessness elsewhere in the world. Impunity, he argues, breeds corruption.\n\n\"Gaza is not a humanitarian crisis; it is a crisis of humanity,\" stated China's representative to the U.N., a sentiment that holds true. Nevertheless, statements from right-wing politicians in the current Israeli government often imply that thousands of Palestinian children bear blame for their deaths during years of protests against the Israeli occupation and indiscriminate bombing.\n\nKilling, however, is not an easy act. The technique of dehumanizing the enemy has been employed historically, such as by the German Nazis against the Jews, the Zionists against the Palestinians, jihadists against \"kafeers\" (infidels), Ukrainian nationalists against Russian separatists, and reciprocally, by almost all Ukrainians against Russians and vice versa.\n\nDehumanizing another human being and cultivating a sense of superiority facilitates the killing process by eliciting the necessary emotions: hatred, thirst for revenge, and bitterness. However, murder fundamentally contradicts the ethics of humanism embedded in the national and spiritual traditions of any society. This contradiction is why the suffering of the Palestinians, representing global injustice, triggers deep and widespread protests worldwide.\n\nNevertheless, it is crucial not to let the passion that united millions in compassion for the people of Palestine and their desire for freedom become merely a vast but futile expenditure of human energy. The lack of results in the struggle for justice can breed feelings of helplessness and deep indifference among people, leading to the overall degradation of society.\n\nTherefore, there is an urgent need for a comprehensive overhaul of political elites, social systems, and norms of human existence in all societies, acknowledging that ideal states do not exist.\n\nFollowing any war, the rules are typically dictated by the victors. It is anticipated that the U.N., as the primary regulator of international life after World War II, will persist after the current World War III but will inevitably undergo reform. The new system of international relations should ideally incorporate the lessons learned from the 20th and 21st centuries and reassess the mechanisms for implementing international law, which currently face challenges.\n\nThe current inaction of the U.N. needs to be reevaluated, and the international organization should, in the future, play a definitive role in safeguarding the world against the outbreak of wars.\n\nFurthermore, there is an urgent call to restore and strengthen moral norms across all spheres of human activity, including international relations. Institutionalizing ethical values in politics is particularly important. The historical trajectory of human development will be shaped by the outcomes of the global transition to a new world. The choice lies between continuing on the path of hatred, profit, and war or opting for forgiveness, healing, and cooperation in the pursuit of peace.\n\nPS: Since October 7, Kazakhstan has evacuated 166 of its citizens and their family members from Israel and 126 from the Gaza Strip. Israel denied permission for 17 people to leave, citing alleged links to HAMAS. The Kazakhstan Foreign Ministry did not dispute this. Additionally, two Kazakhstani citizens were killed by Israeli bombardment in the city of Khan Yunis in mid-November: Julia Abu-Mealak and her daughter Elena. They do not resemble terrorists.\n\nAlso, on January 26, the International Court of Justice, the highest judicial body of the United Nations, concluded that there was substantial evidence suggesting Israel's potential involvement in genocide. As a result, the court issued \"preliminary measures\" mandating Israel to halt mass deaths. Simultaneously, Israel accused UNRWA, the primary UN agency responsible for Gaza's humanitarian aid, of complicity in the October 7 attack.\n\nThis accusation prompted the United States, Great Britain, and seven other European nations to suspend funding for UNRWA, jeopardizing the aid organization's ability to prevent further civilian casualties, including famine and disease.\n\nAccording to the U.N., from October 2023, over two years, at least 10,000 civilians, including over 560 children, perished in Ukraine, encompassing Russians in Donbass, with 18,500 individuals sustaining injuries. In parallel, Israel's bombardment of the Gaza Strip over nearly four months claimed the lives of more than 28,000 people, with 70% being women and children. These egregious acts against humanity demand immediate cessation, and Israel must be held accountable.\n\nSir Vincent Lyn assisted in the writing and editing of this article.\n\nWhen you donate to CovertAction Magazine, you are supporting investigative journalism.

        "title": "Does the US Army's future lie in Europe or Asia?",
        "text": "THE YEAR 1973 was a pivotal one for America's army. The force was battered and broken from Vietnam. In January the defence secretary announced the end of conscription; two months later the last combat troops left Vietnam. But the Arab-Israeli war which broke out on Yom Kippur in October planted the seeds of renewal. The lessons of that war, absorbed by American officers dispatched to Israel, helped reshape the US Army into the modern and professional force which would vanquish Iraq in 1991.\n\nTHE YEAR 1973 was a pivotal one for America's army. The force was battered and broken from Vietnam. In January the defence secretary announced the end of conscription; two months later the last combat troops left Vietnam. But the Arab-Israeli war which broke out on Yom Kippur in October planted the seeds of renewal. The lessons of that war, absorbed by American officers dispatched to Israel, helped reshape the US Army into the modern and professional force which would vanquish Iraq in 1991.\n\nToday's generals, who came of age during that transformation, are keenly aware of the resonance. \"There's a loose analogy between the early 1970s and the army of Desert Storm,\" says General James Rainey, who leads the army's Future Command, \"and the army which invaded Iraq in the early 2000s and where we need to be in 2040.\" Two decades of war in Afghanistan and Iraq wore out troops, equipment and ideas. A recruitment shortage remains unresolved. Now the rise of China and the lessons from the war in Ukraine have prompted introspection, renewal and reform.\n\nAmong army civilian and military leaders, there are three big unsettled questions, according to people familiar with those debates. One is whether profound shifts in the character of war, some evident in Ukraine, might render ground forces less important, if not irrelevant.\n\nA second is how to balance resources between Asia and Europe (Asia being the Pentagon's priority and Europe where Russia is rearming fast). The army can prepare for conflicts in both places but it cannot actually wage those wars at the same time -- and it is no longer asked to do so. The 2018 National Defence Strategy ended the \"two war\" standard, a change accepted by the Biden administration.\n\nThat leads to a third, and the most existential for the army. What, beyond the provision of logistics and air defence, would be the role of a ground force in a future war in the Pacific?\n\nWhen General Randy George, the army's chief of staff, was recently asked for book recommendations, he cited \"The Arms of the Future\" by Jack Watling, a young British analyst. The book describes how in recent rounds of Warfighter, a big annual exercise led by America, combat brigades facing increasingly good sensors and longer-ranged and deadlier munitions take huge losses, emerging with 20% combat effectiveness. Artillery devastates infantry and armour well before they can get within sight of the enemy.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has reinforced those findings. Some argue that the US Army, better trained and armed than Ukraine's, and with air cover above, would fare better. General Rainey nonetheless assumes the worst. \"We're going to fight under constant observation,\" says General Rainey, \"and in constant contact of some form. There is no break. There is no sanctuary.\" He says that American \"lessons learned\" teams were in place three days before the invasion to collect observations. They will have had some nasty surprises: American-made GPS-guided shells and rockets initially worked well; more recently, they have struggled against Russian jamming.\n\nThe army recognises that where it could once patiently muster its forces before launching a large-scale offensive -- as it did against Iraq in 1991 and 2003 -- it now has to prioritise dispersal, mobility and concealment. The drone attack which killed three soldiers in Jordan on January 28th was the first successful attack on American troops by aircraft since the Korean war. Katie Crombe, an army officer, and John Nagl, a professor at the US Army War College in Pennsylvania, point out in a recent paper that Ukraine's battalion command posts comprise seven soldiers who dig into the ground and move twice daily. \"That standard\", they warn, pointing to ingrained habits of hardened command posts, \"will be hard for the US Army to achieve.\"\n\nThe commanders of battalions (about 1,000 soldiers) and brigades (a few thousand), the core units of combat in Afghanistan and Iraq, would be consumed by this intense fighting in a way they were not during counterinsurgency missions. The army is thus reorganising so that more of the burden of planning, logistics, command and control and long-range firepower falls on divisions -- larger formations typically led by two-star generals which stand farther back from the front lines and have more time and space to orchestrate the frenetic battles of the future.\n\nWhat remains unsettled, says Billy Fabian, a former infantry officer and Pentagon planner, is how, precisely, the army's combat forces should be organised for future wars: the balance between firepower on the one hand, dominant in Ukraine, and so-called manoeuvre elements, such as infantry and armour, on the other. \"Fighting land wars is the army's raison d'\u00eatre,\" he says, \"and Ukraine raises tough questions that challenge deeply ingrained elements core to the army's self-conception.\"\n\nHanging over these reforms is the larger question of where the army will be asked to fight. National defence strategies published by the Trump and Biden administrations instruct the Pentagon to focus on China. In fact, the army grew its footprint in Europe after Russia's first invasion of Ukraine in 2014. It has since reinforced the continent with a corps and division headquarters, an infantry and armour brigade, a rocket artillery battalion and numerous other support forces. In contrast, relatively few new forces have flowed into Asia.\n\nFor many years, the US Army's principal role in the Pacific was to guard bases, provide air defence and handle logistics. To the extent it was a \"manoeuvre\" force, in military parlance, it was focused on North Korea. Other services have looked down their noses at it. \"The navy has a stranglehold on the leadership of Indo-Pacific Command,\" says Stacie Pettyjohn of the Centre for a New American Security, a think-tank in Washington. \"They see the army only in a supporting role in a maritime theatre.\"\n\nGeneral Charles Flynn, the commander of the US Army Pacific, vigorously rebuts such ideas, speaking to The Economist in his headquarters in Hawaii. \"Humans have this unique tendency to live on land,\" he says. \"At the end of the day, decisions are going to be made by the pointy end of a gun.\" The primacy of land is as true in Asia as it is in Europe, he argues, not least because the region's largest countries, like India and Indonesia, have military forces dominated by armies. The idea is that, by building ties to them in peacetime, the army can position itself to project military power westward.\n\nThe growing pace of exercises (more than 40 take place annually) is a core part of that. General Flynn points to the examples of Talisman Sabre in Australia and Garuda Shield in Indonesia. Both were once relatively modest army-to-army exercises. They have grown and now involve the navy and air force. Both also involved the army's Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center (JPMRC), in essence, physical and virtual training equipment that can be deployed around the region to do things which could only have been done at a large base in Louisiana. Such drills are morphing into a near-permanent presence: the army is deployed in the region for eight months of the year.\n\nAlongside that is a reimagining of how the army would fight. The premise is that China has optimised its forces to attack American satellites, ships and air bases. \"What it's not designed against\", says General Bernard Harrington, \"is to find, fix and finish land formations that are distributed, mobile and networked.\" That has prompted the creation of three experimental \"multi-domain task forces\", or MDTFs, the first of which is focused on Asia and commanded by General Harrington.\n\nEach MDTF has four battalions which can deploy small units along the first island chain which runs from Japan to the Philippines. The idea is that these can fight not just on land -- soldier v soldier, tank v tank -- but across domains. Imagine that America needs to target a Chinese ship. The MDTF's \"effects\" battalion might jam its radar and hack its networks; if that does not neutralise the ship, it makes it more likely that anti-ship missiles launched by a \"fires\" battalion will get through. The force's long-range hypersonic missiles, which arrived last year, have a range just short of 3,000km -- enough to reach from Japan to Taiwan, or from the Philippines to the South China Sea.\n\nInitial experiments with the MDTFs have shown promise, though some are sceptical that this high-tech vision of war would survive contact with reality. They have also yielded useful lessons. General Harrington says that an exercise in the Philippines last year was a reminder that HIMARS rocket launchers and intelligence equipment, full of delicate electronics, fare less well in the heat and humidity of tropical Asia than in the American proving ground where they were first tested. Two MDTFs are currently devoted to Asia, with a third for Europe. The original plan envisioned a total five, with an additional one in the Arctic and one for global tasks.\n\nAll this would seem to offer a definitive answer to the army's identity crisis: Asia first. Inside the Department of the Army, nestled within the Pentagon, there are doubts, though. One question is whether its own plans mesh with those of the armed services as a whole. \"The army still feels marginalised in the Pacific,\" says Ms Pettyjohn. Another is whether the army itself has pivoted ruthlessly enough. Its fleet of watercraft has shrunk dramatically in recent years, for instance. \"Watercraft are an absolute indicator of true commitment to the Pacific,\" says J.P. Clark, another Army War College professor. \"They are quite expensive, only really useful for that theatre, and absolutely essential.\"\n\nThe MDTFs themselves remain \"niche\" formations, argues Mr Fabian. The largest formation allocated to the region is the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii, he points out, a light-infantry division. \"It seems like the Army is trying to have it both ways,\" argues Mr Fabian. \"Talk about fires and air defence for the Pacific, but stay a combined-arms force organised for close combat like it's always been.\" The army hedges its bets, says an insider, because it rarely wages the war it expects.\n\nTrade-offs abound. Short-range artillery is vital for Europe; less so in Asia. \"I just don't know what you'd fire a 155-round at out in the Pacific other than the water,\" quipped a top Pentagon official recently. The army will have to make firm choices in the next year or two, say officials. In part that is because it is creating more units than it can reliably man. The army expected to finish last year short of 10,000 recruits, a 15% shortfall and the second consecutive year of under-enlistment. Much of that is down to America's tight labour market but it also reflects waning enthusiasm towards military service, and towards combat arms in particular.\n\nThe fall in the size of the \"individual ready reserve\" -- reservists not allocated to a particular unit -- from 450,000 in 1994 to 76,000 in 2018 worsens the problem. Ukraine shows how intense wars tend to chew up regular armies, requiring an infusion of citizens with military experience. Today's shortage of combat soldiers is tomorrow's shortage of reservists. Ms Crombe and Mr Nagl are among those who favour the notion of \"partial conscription\", an idea backed by just 20% of Americans. Now, as in the pivotal moments of the mid-1970s, the army finds itself wrestling with profound questions over its size, shape and purpose, ones that will eventually touch, as they did then, its relationship to American society.",

        "text": "For some time, it's been apparent that the world's nations are not meeting the growing challenges to human survival.\n\nA key challenge comes from modern war.\n\nOver the centuries, as military weapons have grown ever more destructive, war-related devastation has grown accordingly. World War II was the deadliest military conflict in human history, with an estimated 70-85 million people perishing from the war directly or through war-caused disease, famine, and other indirect factors. Most of the dead were civilians. In addition, many millions of people were wounded--blinded, crippled, driven mad, or otherwise ravaged by the vast carnage. Large portions of the globe had become a charnel house, with the battered survivors left to desperately scavenge for food amid the burnt-out rubble and ruin.\n\nAlthough some scholars have pointed out that warfare has declined since then, and especially since the end of the Cold War, there was a sharp turnabout in 2022, when the wars in Ethiopia and Ukraine contributed to more battle-related deaths than in any year since 1994. By late 2023, Russia's military invasion of Ukraine alone had produced an estimated 315,000 killed or injured Russian troops, while the number of casualties among Ukrainian troops and civilians, though unknown, is certainly enormous. Among these and the many other wars currently raging--in Sudan, Myanmar, Ethiopia, the Sahel, and Syria, to name only a few--the recent one in Gaza, with the fastest daily death rate of the 21 century, is particularly alarming, having already led to nearly 30,000 deaths and nearly 70,000 injuries.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's nuclear war, which emerged in 1945 with the utter annihilation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and which now has the capacity to end virtually all life on earth. Amid public threats from leaders of nuclear-armed nations to launch a nuclear war, the editors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists have set their \"Doomsday Clock\" at its closest ever to apocalypse.\n\nWar--particularly nuclear war--is probably the fastest way to extinguish the human race, but there are other crises underway that, on a longer-range basis, seem likely to accomplish the same task.\n\nThe most serious of these crises is environmental. In recent decades, there has been a rapid loss of biodiversity, with the sixth mass extinction of wildlife clearly accelerating. Pollution has grown dramatically. This includes pollution of land and water caused by chemicals and by plastic (which takes 400 years to decompose) and of the air caused by industrial, motor vehicle, and other emissions (leading to an estimated 4.2 to 7 million human deaths annually). Damage to the soil, caused especially by use of toxic chemicals and other pollutants, as well as by deforestation, has become particularly severe. The United Nations has estimated that some 40 percent of the planet's soil is now degraded.\n\nA key element in the environmental collapse is the growing climate catastrophe, caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels. Melting icecaps and rising sea levels, unprecedented hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, and ocean acidification are all well underway. Together with unsustainable farming practices, rising temperatures have produced growing food and water scarcity. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres declared that, unless immediate action is taken, there will be a \"global food emergency that could have long term impacts on hundreds of millions of adults and children.\" Furthermore, it is estimated that, by 2025, two-thirds of the world's people might face water shortages. Commenting on the deteriorating climate situation, Guterres declared gloomily in September 2023 that \"humanity has opened the gates to hell\".\n\nThe rise of rightwing nationalism provides yet another challenge to human survival. In recent years, rightwing political movements--headed by authoritarian demagogues such as Donald Trump (United States), Jair Bolsonaro (Brazil), Vladimir Putin (Russia), Narendra Modi (India), Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkey), Marine Le Pen (France), Benjamin Netanyahu (Israel), Viktor Orban (Hungary), and their counterparts in other lands--have transformed the landscape of world politics. Appealing to xenophobia, militarism, racism, and religious prejudice, they have made great strides toward stirring up longstanding hatreds in their ruthless quest for power. A key to their success along these lines has been their call to revive the ostensible glory of their own nations by purging their internal enemies and triumphing over other, ostensibly inferior, countries abroad. Redolent of the fascist movements of the 1930s, this Radical Right approach portends worldwide turmoil, violence, and destruction.\n\nOf course, it might not be too late to head off these developments. After all, in the twentieth century, humanity did manage to defeat the drive of the rightwing maniacs who established fascist regimes and launched vast wars to rule the world. In the aftermath of the chaos and destruction of World War II, humanity did manage to create the United Nations and to extend the range of international law. And, still later, as the planet stood on the brink of nuclear war, humanity did manage to roll back the nuclear menace and, for a time, halt the nuclear arms race and curb the prevalence of war.",

        "title": "Israeli lies about a 'land bridge' to the Gulf show the Yemeni blockade is working",
        "text": "Since the beginning of its genocidal war on Gaza, Israel's supply lines have been jeopardized. After Israel closed all its borders to imports headed to Gaza and struck the Rafah crossing to put it out of order, Hamas attacked the ports of Ashkelon and Ashdod, which were used to import oil and supplies used in the war machine, after which Israel had to halt port operations and shift ships to Eilat.\n\nAs the genocide in Gaza continued unabated, Yemen took part in the war by blockading Eilat's port, which forced Israel to relocate its supply lines to the port of Haifa on the Mediterranean Sea. Last month, Iraq announced an additional blockade on Israel in the Mediterranean, expected to be enforced in February if the ongoing rounds of negotiations between Israel and Hamas to end the war fail. Activists in Jordan are also calling for a land blockade on the border with Israel.\n\nThese blockades against Israel are causing consumer prices and business costs to go up in the country, deteriorating the trust in the Israeli economy and its financial markets. Amid this chaos, a not-so-successful Israeli company, Trucknet, has alleged that it has established a \"land bridge\" connecting the Gulf to Israel through Jordan, offering Israel the lifeline it desperately needs to navigate the negative impacts of the maritime blockades today and in the future.\n\nThis claim was quickly picked up by the \"Axis of Resistance\" media groups, followed by widespread criticism on social media accusing the UAE and Saudi Arabia of complicity in the war on Gaza and demanding the curtailment of \"the land bridge.\"\n\nYet a cursory investigation of the companies supposedly responsible for facilitating this \"land bridge\" calls into question whether it actually exists in the first place. Despite Israeli claims, there is very little evidence to show that there is an effective \"land bridge\" between Israel, Jordan, and the Gulf. Still, the reasons for the persistence of these claims have more to do with Israel's desire to promote its postwar normalization with the region in the long run, while calming investors and consumers in Israel in the short term and forestalling an Israeli economic crash. Furthermore, Israel is using this claim to undermine the Palestinian position in the ongoing negotiations over the conclusion of the genocidal war.\n\nThe story of the alleged land bridge originates with a failing Israeli tech company called Trucknet, which provides a digital platform to optimize shipments -- in other words, a data company, not a shipping company. On December 5, 2023, the company issued a press release reporting an agreement in principle for cooperation with a UAE-based company called Puretrans, allegedly working in cooperation with Dubai Ports and specializing in logistics, freight, and transportation brokerage.\n\nAs part of the agreement, both companies have ostensibly \"agreed\" to cooperate so that cargo shippers and transport service providers can use the Trucknet platform to optimize transportation between the ports of Dubai and Haifa. This will include the automation of cargo transportation and provide real-time tracking of trucks, CO2 emissions, and the status of shipments. But the company's claims don't add up.\n\nSeveral details emerge upon investigating Trucknet's original Hebrew press release and the circumstances surrounding Puretrans, Trucknet's alleged UAE partner, which show that these companies are not engaged in any shipping.* What's more, no commercial activities exist for a UAE company under the name of Puretrans.\n\nIn addition, it seems that Trucknet is involved in the financial manipulation of its stock, which appears to be a motivator for making the claim. A day before the announcement, the company's stock price was 127 NIS. By December 18, the price had doubled, reaching 256 NIS. The price has since returned to the pre-announcement price range, at 159 NIS. If the company is generating additional revenues due to increased business activity as a result of the land bridge, the price of the stock would not have plummeted so severely. Instead, the price would have increased to reflect the new financial gains.\n\nIn other words, it appears that the claims about the company's activities are fictitious. But despite the lack of firm evidence of the existence of a land bridge, the story has been widely shared by pro-Palestine activists as evidence of UAE complicity in the war by offering Israel a lifeline as it struggles to use the Red Sea to import necessary items from Asia. The UAE made no comments in response to these allegations. Jordanian public officials have denied the existence of such a land bridge, yet did not deny the existence of some trade between Jordan and Israel, as per prior economic and political agreements. Despite the slim evidence, the wide reaction to the inaccurate news has captured the attention of Israeli public officials.\n\nThe Israeli Minister of Transportation, Miri Regev, has sought to capitalize on the panic of the pro-Palestine activists to legitimize her government further as it is increasingly accused of damaging the Israeli economy, desiring to undermine the psychological effectiveness of the Yemen blockade on the Red Sea. On January 22, 2024, Regev posted on X claiming a team to enable the overland transportation of goods from Abu Dhabi to Israel had been established. On February 13, she published another post during a visit to India showing the alleged shipping docks for the goods shipped to Israel through the alleged land bridge.\n\nWhat Regev failed to mention is that the Yemen blockade on Israel already covers the Arabian Sea, which means any ship destined for Israel from India, even before it uses the presumed land bridge, will be struck as if it were passing through the Red Sea. A ship destined for India was already struck earlier this month by the Yemeni Armed Forces, demonstrating their ability to prevent any land bridge India may support through ships to the UAE.\n\nPrior to the minister's expression of intentions about formalizing the land bridge, there was no evidence of the existence of a UAE company called Puretrans. A company website was created under the domain \"puretrans.ae.\" The contact page on the site lists \"puretrans@alphoenixgroup.com\" as a company email. The mother company's website shows it was created in Tel Aviv. The website claims the company offers \"electric shipping\" across the Middle East, even though the relevant technologies do not exist yet, and no supporting evidence was provided to show the electric ships or vehicles allegedly used in this futuristic process.\n\nAdditionally, another company associated with the group, Puretech, was also created in Israel, whose founder, Abdo Qassem, is an Israeli citizen based in Haifa. His associate, Nadine Rohana, is also an Israeli.\n\nTaken together, the available information on Puretrans would indicate that Israel has invented a fake company in the UAE while manufacturing a narrative based on deliberately inaccurate information to create a false impression that such a land bridge is not only a possibility but also already in existence.\n\nThat said, there might be some low-volume truck movement for testing a future prospective land bridge, but such traffic would not even constitute a pilot program, let alone a vaunted land bridge.\n\nMost people think the idea of the land bridge is a result of this war. It is not. It is actually part of the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridors (IMEC), which were announced last year by the U.S. and its allies during the G20 meeting in September. The IMEC are planned economic corridors that aim to bolster the partners' economic development by fostering connectivity and economic integration through railways, clean energy, and data pipelines among Asia, the Persian Gulf, and Europe. Specifically, it is supposed to connect Greece to India through a land bridge that crosses the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Israel, with the ports of Dubai and Haifa operating as maritime shipping hubs. The vision for IMEC was used by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu during his speech at the UN in September 2023, which he represented visually as the map of \"a new Middle East\" from which Palestine would be erased.\n\nThis is the real land bridge, and it doesn't exist yet. The projected bridge is not supposed to be roads-based, but railway-reliant. The IMEC thus far isn't even a formal agreement, but an expression of intention, which was supposed to be followed by deliberations to take place within 60 days following the September G20 meeting. But October 7 threw a wrench in the talks, which is to say, the land bridge as of yet remains an idea.\n\nOnline videos showing trucks coming to Israel from Jordan are not actually linked to the alleged land bridge with the Gulf. Rather, this has been taking place due to preexisting peace agreements dating back to 1994. In 2021, trade between Jordan and Israel amounted to $430 million, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity, and included displays, cars, petrochemical products, foodstuffs, agricultural products, and energy supplies. Given the maritime blockade, this trade activity may have increased in volume, leading to the perception of a new, qualitatively different \"land bridge.\" Still, this movement in trade has already existed for decades, and even an increased volume in trade with Jordan cannot offset the losses from the maritime blockade.\n\nAs per the agreement, Jordan is not legally allowed to ban exports from Jordan to Israel or otherwise risk breaking the peace treaty and becoming a party to the current and future wars with Israel. Despite the state's official stance, many Jordanians took to the streets to demand stopping the supplies to Israel and cutting trade. This is not a new phenomenon in Jordan. Previously, Jordanians protested gas supplies from Israel and demanded their curtailment. The protests this time, however, are motivated by the desire to undermine Israel's ability to carry on its genocide in Gaza. Jordanians perceive current trade as complicity in the war.\n\nAs Jordanian protestors' demands for a land blockade grow in pursuit of disrupting Israel's war machine, Israel is not only actively promoting the idea of a land bridge from the same borders, but is pretending that it already exists. The question remains, why is Israel so invested in maintaining the charade?\n\nThe answer lies in Israel's campaign of psychological warfare, which is not only waged against the Palestinian people but also its own citizens in order to raise morale and bolster the war effort. The maritime blockade is currently exacting a heavy economic cost through inflationary pressures, which in turn has intimidated businesses, curtailed investments, and changed consumers' spending patterns. This precarious situation can easily spiral into an economic crisis as prices continue to skyrocket and Israel's supply chains remain unreliable. Amidst the panic, Israel might witness investor flight, and civil unrest could follow, which is already exacerbated by the deep political rift in Israeli society with respect to the current Netanyahu government.\n\nIn such a scenario, even a fake story about a land bridge might help calm Israeli consumers and businesses in the hopes of altering their behavior. What this means, in essence, is that the so-called \"land bridge\" is an Israeli PSYOP aimed at preventing an economic and financial crash, which can easily become a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nThe far bigger problem is not the land bridge, but the already existing trade agreement with Jordan. While Israel has used the land bridge story as a means of bolstering its own economy and promoting the prospects for an actual land corridor in the future, the key chokepoint in such a prospective corridor is Jordan. Jordan has a critical mass of Palestinian citizens, and yet it is the only country through which such a corridor can feasibly pass. Pro-Palestine activists in Jordan should therefore focus their efforts on severing Jordan's longstanding trade agreement with Israel, which might frustrate any potential economic corridor in the future while turning the screws on Israel in the present as it continues in its genocidal war.\n\n* First, upon analyzing the original press release in Hebrew, it is clear that Trucknet itself is not involved in any shipping except through tracking of certain indicators and offering data. Second, there is no need for trucks destined for Israel to reach Haifa port. A link to Haifa port means the cargo will be destined for export, not local consumption, and the alleged land bridge is meant to offset the maritime blockade on consumer goods. Hence, the claim is illogical, as trucks will unload sooner before reaching Haifa in the west of the country, even if there were such a bridge. Third, at the time of the press release, Puretrans, the alleged UAE partner, had no presence online.",

        "title": "Mint Primer | India and the Red Sea sharks: crisis without an end?",
        "text": "Houthi attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea, in reprisal for Israeli bombing of Gaza, continue unabated and the disruption they are causing is beginning to pinch. As the crisis enters its fourth month, Mint looks at the impact on India and the sectors that have been hit.\n\nThere are no signs at all of any improvement. On Tuesday, a British registered cargo ship, 'Rubymar', which was on its way to Bulgaria from the United Arab Emirates, was hit by two ballistic missiles fired by Houthi rebels. The damage was significant and, for the first time since the crisis broke out in November, a ship had to be abandoned and is now at risk of sinking. This, despite the US and Britain resorting to bombing Houthi positions in Yemen. Now, most shipping lines continue to avoid the Red Sea. Since mid-December, the number of crude carriers transiting through the Red Sea is down 60%.\n\nSlim at the moment. Houthis say the disruption to global trade will force the world to persuade Israel to halt hostilities and announce a ceasefire in Gaza. A Houthi spokesman posted on the social media platform X the need was for an \"urgent and comprehensive ceasefire\" in Gaza and not militarization of the Red Sea. The opposite is happening. The Israeli operation in Gaza continues. The US and Britain have started air strikes on Houthi positions in Yemen. The EU has launched a naval mission to protect ships. A swift resolution looks improbable considering the geo-political standings of various countries.\n\nFreight rates, be it for containers or for carrying crude, have risen sharply as ships take a detour around Africa. Experts peg the rise at 30-50%. Insurance costs have risen too. The transit time has increased by about two weeks on average. Containers leaving China are taking longer to return, triggering fears of another supply chain disruption.\n\nIt's beginning to bite -- almost 80% of all exports, as much as $8 billion a month, to Europe passes through the Red Sea. In fact, 25% of India's foreign trade uses this route. Sustained disruption could hurt India's merchandise exports in 2023-24. According to India Ratings & Research, freight rates for Indian companies have seen a jump of 150% in the last 45 days. Higher freight costs are making Indian players uncompetitive in select sectors, and they are losing out to competitors who are located closer to the buyer.\n\nSectors with significant exposure to Europe have been hit hardest. They include textiles, leather, spices, engineering goods and gems & jewellery. Importers are not reimbursing higher costs and are demanding faster delivery cycles to make up for longer transit time. A lot depends on the size of the players and the type of goods they export. Smaller players are losing out as they are unable to service the higher freight and carrying costs. Exporters of low value-add and large volume products are also hit.",

        "text": "During his second term as Brazilian president in 2010, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva visited Jerusalem's Holocaust museum with his Israeli counterpart Shimon Peres and said all world leaders should travel there to understand what happens \"when irrationality takes over\".\n\nThirteen years later, Israel's foreign minister chose the same spot to declare Lula, now serving his third term, persona non grata in the Jewish state until he retracted impromptu remarks comparing the death toll in the air and land offensive in Gaza to the Holocaust.\n\nFollowing Israel Katz's extraordinary step, Brazil rejected the Israeli minister's remarks as \"revolting\" and accused him of lying about Lula's comments, which had been made at an African summit.\n\nThe diplomatic row overshadowed a G20 foreign ministers' meeting chaired by Brazil in Rio de Janeiro this week -- with US secretary of state Antony Blinken saying he had a \"frank exchange\" with Lula on the matter.\n\n\"The Brazil-Israel spat is not merely a hiccup but a reflection of Israel's growing difficulties in making its case across the global south,\" said Oliver Stuenkel, associate professor of international relations at the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Get\u00falio Vargas in S\u00e3o Paulo. \"The global north and the global south diverge quite a bit on this conflict.\"\n\nMany nations with a history of colonial occupation have historically supported Palestinian aspirations to independent statehood. But the west's relatively muted response to the rapidly mounting death toll in Gaza -- in contrast to its immediate and repeated denunciation of Russian killing in Ukraine -- exposed what some developing nations see as hypocrisy and double standards.\n\nIn opening remarks to the G20, Brazil's foreign minister Mauro Vieira contrasted the nations of the North, tied by the Nato military alliance, with those of the south, which were \"covered by various layers and zones of peace and co-operation\".\n\nAs the Gaza death toll mounted, Brazil's Brics ally South Africa opened a case against Israel at the International Court of Justice last month alleging genocide against the Palestinian people, a charge the Jewish state strongly rejected.\n\n\"Some have told us to mind our own business. Others have said it was not our place,\" President Cyril Ramaphosa said after the ICJ handed an interim order to Israel to prevent its military from committing acts, which might be considered genocidal and to enable humanitarian assistance to Gaza.\n\n\"And yet it is very much our place, as people who know too well the pain of dispossession, discrimination and state-sponsored violence. We, as South Africans, will not be passive bystanders and watch the crimes that were visited upon us being perpetrated elsewhere,\" Ramaphosa added.\n\nAt the African Union summit in Addis Ababa where Lula spoke last weekend, leaders lined up to condemn Israel's offensive against Hamas in Gaza, which Palestinian authorities say has killed more than 29,000 people. Hamas's attacks on Israel on October 7, which prompted the war in Gaza, killed 1,200 people and 250 were taken hostage.\n\nMoussa Faki, chair of the African Union Commission, said Israel's offensive was the \"most flagrant\" violation of international law and accused Israel of wanting to \"exterminate\" Gaza's inhabitants. Azali Assoumani, outgoing chair of the African Union, condemned \"the genocide Israel is committing in Palestine under our nose\".\n\nNot all African nations have criticised Israel. Kenya, Ghana, Malawi and the Democratic Republic of Congo have voiced support, but they are in the minority.\n\nIsrael retains some other allies in the developing world, notably India's nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Argentina's libertarian president Javier Milei.\n\nBut experts say the heavy death toll in Gaza has triggered an unprecedented hardening of attitudes against the Jewish state in the developing world.\n\n\"What has been unfolding in Gaza and [Israeli president Benjamin] Netanyahu's intransigence has generated a pretty united picture in Latin America that goes beyond left and right politics,\" said Michael Shifter, former president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington think-tank. \"It's deeper than that.\"\n\nThe presidents of Colombia and Bolivia rushed to support Lula, while Mexico and Chile have asked the Hague-based International Criminal Court to investigate Israel for possible crimes against civilians in Gaza, even though Israel does not recognise the court's authority.\n\nClaudio Epelman, executive director of the Latin American Jewish Congress, raised the concern that the Brazilian government's \"aggressive\" position on the war in Gaza had provided cover for politicians close to Lula to take anti-Jewish positions.\n\nJose Geno\u00edno, a former president of Lula's party, alarmed Brazil's 150,000-strong Jewish community when he called last month for a boycott of Jewish-owned businesses \"to hurt economic interests\". Far from condemning his remarks, two of Lula's cabinet ministers supported him.\n\nModi's government in India has cultivated close ties with Israel since taking power in 2014 and has refrained from condemning the Gaza offensive. But it has lamented the loss of life, sent humanitarian aid to Gaza and reiterated India's support for the creation of a sovereign Palestinian state.\n\nUnions and a swath of Indian civil society, however, have voiced opposition. A union representing port workers last week said it would refuse to load or unload weapons to Israel \"in solidarity with a call by Palestinian trade unions\".\n\nThe ICJ case, meanwhile, burnishes South Africa's portrayal of itself as an alternative to a world order it sees as based on western hegemony. Ramaphosa led vocal denunciations of western vaccine nationalism during the pandemic, and has cast the recent expansion of the Brics grouping as a bulwark against western economic interests.\n\n\"They saw an opportunity to test the [international] system, and that's precisely what they've done,\" said Piers Pigou, Southern Africa programme head at the Institute of Security Studies.\n\nFGV's Stuenkel noted that the divergence between the west and the developing world over Gaza is mirrored in Ukraine; in both conflicts, many emerging powers have repudiated war and called for negotiations to find a peaceful solution.\n\n\"When you look at the two most visible global conflicts at this point -- Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas -- on both, there's quite a division between the global north and the global south,\" he said.",

        "title": "Two Wars Are Poisoning the Political Debate Everywhere - BNN Bloomberg",
        "text": "(Bloomberg) -- The divisions sown by the Israel-Hamas conflict and Russia's war on Ukraine were on full display this week in two political arenas an ocean apart.\n\nIn extraordinary scenes in London, the House of Commons broke down over a vote calling for a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas. Around the same time, Group of 20 foreign ministers meeting in Rio de Janeiro were at loggerheads over the desperate humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and Russia's aggression toward its neighbor, Ukraine.\n\nWhile the moments on different continents were different in nature -- the one domestic, the other at a multinational forum -- each reflects how entrenched positions are paralyzing decision-making. That's adding to the most charged geopolitical environment in decades, with once-unthinkable comments and unlikely scenarios playing out as almost half the world heads to the polls.\n\nIn the space of a few days, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva compared what is happening in the Gaza Strip to the Nazi extermination of Jews. US President Joe Biden called Russian leader Vladimir Putin a \"crazy SOB.\" And Donald Trump compared his legal woes to the death of Russian opposition activist Alexey Navalny.\n\nThe G-20 provided an opportunity to get US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in the same room at a pivotal moment. With the war about to enter its third year, Russian forces are back on the offensive, $60 billion of US aid for Ukraine is being held up by Republican opposition, and the Biden administration is weighing \"major\" new sanctions after the death of Navalny.\n\nLavrov used the forum to air a long and well-rehearsed diatribe against the \"West.\" At one point, India's G-20 representative urged his colleagues to avoid allowing the wars to soak up all of the meeting's oxygen, according to a person who was in the room.\n\nDiscussion of the wars in Europe and the Middle East still dominated the afternoon's proceedings. Lavrov defended Russia's continued presence in Ukraine. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron said it was \"clearly unacceptable.\"\n\nBack in London, a vote on the Israel-Hamas conflict had lawmakers walk off in protest and others refusing to cast their ballot. As Conservative prime minister, Cameron endured the humiliation of losing a vote in the commons over military intervention in Syria back in 2013. Tony Blair won his vote in 2003 to join the US-led campaign in Iraq, but it was arguably the moment that marked the beginning of his Labour government's decline and a decision which clouds his reputation to this day.\n\nThis wasn't about committing UK forces. The chaos in what the UK likes to call the mother of parliaments was in part a procedural flub, with the speaker apologizing for his role.\n\nBut at its root was a bitter fight within Keir Starmer's Labour Party over how to square its strong support among British Muslims with a push to shed accusations of antisemitism. Tipping its hand one way or another would risk upsetting voters and squandering its poll lead with elections looming.\n\nThe seeds for today's dysfunction were planted years ago. Russia was ejected from the G-8 back in 2014 after Putin annexed Crimea. But the US and its fellow G-7 allies were slow to realize that the world didn't necessarily share their desire to make a pariah out of Moscow.\n\nThe wake-up call came when just half the G-20 members chose to sanction Russia after Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. The subsequent expansion of the BRICS grouping from its core of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa was another signal of the growing challenge to the western order. Many nations, especially in Asia and Africa, are unhappy at being caught between the US and China's superpower rivalry.\n\nEven in US allies and across America itself, opinion is deeply divided over arming Ukraine and whether and how to rein in Israel.\n\nTwo years in, there is no foreseeable end to Russia's war in Ukraine, with some bracing for Putin to expand his aggression to perhaps take on NATO.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war is rippling out with all kinds of unintended consequences. Yemen-based Houthi militants are attacking cargo ships and disrupting global trade, prompting the US and its allies to send warships to the Red Sea. Groups backed by Iran have entered the regional chaos as they claim to be defending the rights of Palestinians.\n\nIn Europe, Russia's aggression raises existential questions about security and the future role of the US, while governments are faced with raising defense spending at a time when economies are weak and voters hurting.\n\nIn its 25-year history, the G-20 operated primarily as a vehicle of economic collaboration. It's ill-suited to provide answers to the current world's predicaments.\n\nThe United Nations is a busted flush in Israel's eyes, and the UN Security Council is in any case deadlocked. Brazil is calling for its reform.\n\nBrazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira struck a note that most can probably agree upon: \"Multilateral institutions are unequipped to handle global tensions,\" he said in Rio.",

        "text": "I am old enough to remember when it was considered a disgrace to even countenance the idea American could lose a war. Under Joe Biden, losing a war is a regular occurrence.\n\nVlad Putin took a victory lap in our latest defeat, the Ukraine War, by ruthlessly killing one of his few living Russian opponents -- Alexei Navalny. Joe Biden promised there would be reprisals if Navalny died back in 2021, but of course, that was an empty threat. Instead, buoyed by cynical regimes from China to India to North Korea willing to break international sanctions, Putin's terror state keeps on humming.\n\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\n\nUkraine's year-long offensive ran out of steam in the fall, just as I predicted. The Biden administration got way behind on weapon deliveries to Ukraine. There was already a huge ammo problem this summer when funds were supposedly in place.\n\nAll Biden's people have now is the ridiculous supplemental military aid package. This has billions of dollars more in \"humanitarian aid for Palestine\" as the price for helping Israel. No actions to secure our own borders, and just enough money to keep Ukraine fighting, but not defeating Russia, for another year. Long-requested weapons that once might have made a difference, from F-16 jets to ATACMS missiles, are still nowhere to be found.\n\nIn other words, our strategy is to fight another \"no-win war,\" much as the Democrats ran the Korean and Vietnam wars of the 20 century, or later, the Afghanistan War.\n\nBack in 2019, Donald Trump was impeached for wanting answers from Ukraine's new president about the corrupt payoffs to Joe Biden's family and briefly held up lethal military aid, to further this effort.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky tried to play it both ways; saying he had no problem with Trump, who unlike his predecessor Obama, was sending him massive amounts of weaponry to defend his country. But otherwise, not engaging on the issue.\n\nIn 2020, when the whole Hunter Biden laptop scandal broke, showing the scale of the Biden crime family's foreign payday racket, Zelensky was conspicuously silent.\n\nHad he stepped up back then and started talking about how Biden blackmailed Ukraine to fire Viktor Shokin, the highly-regarded man investigating Burisma, it would have destroyed Old Joe's presidential run.\n\nInstead, he kept his mouth shut while Biden was elected, leaving Biden to resume Obama's policy of delaying weapons shipments, encouraging Putin to think he could invade Ukraine with impunity, especially after Biden's insane comments about a minor incursion.\n\nThat didn't work out so well for any of them. Zelensky lost big chunks of his country; Putin's incompetent soldiers were shot to pieces, once U.S. aid belatedly arrived; and Biden had yet another fiasco to go with his growing collection.\n\nRecently, Speaker Mike Johnson took my advice on further military appropriations -- trade Ukraine money for real border security. This was absolutely the right strategy. Biden and his people have complete contempt for our country and cannot be allowed to simply wave along tens of millions of foreign freeloaders into our nation, as part of their Make America Lousy Again policy.",

        "text": "In this article, we look at 10 countries with the most military drones in the world. You can skip our detailed analysis on the technological advancements in this segment of military warfare and head over directly to the 5 Countries with the Most Military Drones in the World.\n\nThe wars between Azerbaijan and Armenia first in 2020, and then later involving Russia and Ukraine have been the kind of conflicts that western powers had been worrying about, and are now scrambling to prepare themselves for a future that already seems to be here. Demand for military drones have surged over the last few years with countries actively using their unmanned aerial vehicles for intelligence, reconnaissance, surveillance, and target operations.\n\nDrones were a prominent feature of the conflict in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, and have been clouding the skies in Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Borodyanka among other towns and cities in Ukraine, in what is being seen as the arrival of a new threat in the aerial defense space. These uninhabited aerial vehicles have made it difficult for enemy targets to move and hide on the battlefield with their aerial footages offering unprecedented birds-eye views of the war.\n\nThe Americans have been operating drones for about a century now, having deployed them first during World War II, between 1939 and 1945, and then more recently in the war against terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq. Defense experts believe the proliferation of military drones is a concern for US policymakers who worry about China taking a leaf out of Russia's book (strikes on Ukraine), and launching similar attacks against US interests in the Pacific. Moreover, US troops have also come under drone attacks from non-state actors in the Middle East in recent years - most notably from ISIS in Iraq and Syria.\n\nConsidering the rapidly evolving threat, the Americans are taking initiatives to stay a step ahead of their foes. In August 2023, the Department of Defense (DoD) announced to build 'attritable autonomous systems' in mass over the next two years. Moreover, under the Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, the US Air Force plans to develop drone wingmen to fly alongside its premier fighter and bomber jets - Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)'s F-35 and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)'s B-21 Raider.\n\nThese unmanned combat air vehicles will be used to perform several missions, such as surveillance, striking enemies and jamming their signals. The Air Force expects about a thousand CCAs to enter service by 2028, which will mean that they would be ready for deployment with the sixth-generation of fighter jets that are currently being developed under the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program.\n\nAccording to a report, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and General Atomics, are all vying for contracts for the classified CCA initiative. All of these companies have played a significant role in the development of the United States' current fleet of drones.\n\nNorthrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is the manufacturer of the RQ-4 Global Hawk, MQ-4 Triton and the RQ-180 fleets of drones operated by the US military. Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)'s RQ-170 Sentinel was introduced in 2007, and is operated by the Air Force for CIA missions. On the other hand, the MQ-9 Reaper built by General Atomics is one of the most potent drones operated by the US, and serves as the primary offensive strike uninhabited aerial vehicle of the Air Force.\n\nThe Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is currently overseeing the development of the MQ-25 Stingray drone, which will become the first unmanned aerial refueling vehicle that will be carrier-based and will extend the range of the US Navy's aircraft carriers. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) received a $805 million contract in 2018 for four MQ-25 Stingrays to be delivered by August 2024.\n\nAnother prominent defense contractor that builds unmanned aerial vehicles in the US is AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV). It is the manufacturer of the RQ-11B Raven, a small drone, that is the most widely used unmanned aerial vehicle in the world, with more than 19,000 units produced. While originally designed for the US military, AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV)'s RQ-11B Raven are used by air forces of several other countries as well now - including the United Kingdom, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Pakistan. According to figures released by The Center of the Study of the Drone at Bard College in 2020, about 60% of the American drone fleet comprises RQ-11B Raven.\n\nRecently, AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) reported a revenue of $180.8 million in its second quarter results for the fiscal year 2024 - up 62% year-to-year. Wahid Nawabi, the Chairman, President and CEO of the company shared the following remarks in AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV)'s Q2 2024 Earnings Call on December 5, 2023:\n\nWe're very pleased with our performance through the first half of this fiscal year, which included significant topline revenue acceleration and record EBITDA. We remain optimistic about our future exemplified by higher growth, improving operating results and enhanced value creation for our shareholders. As we said last quarter, this reflects not only near-term demand dynamics related to global complexity but also a long-term shift in military strategy to the more frequent use of intelligent multi-domain Unmanned Systems which are either use, highly effective and provide a compelling value proposition. Our differentiated portfolio offers the greatest breadth and depth of unmanned solutions to meet the growing demands of our country and allies.\n\nWe are an industry leader in contested environments as well as AI-enabled autonomous operations and governments around the globe are witnessing these unmatched capabilities effectively perform on real and highly contested battlefields. As a testament to the incredible effectiveness of our innovative solutions, we now have nine different unmanned platforms deployed in Ukraine, all receiving high levels of praise. We could not be prouder and more honored of how our solutions and team members are helping our customers successfully achieve their vital missions.\n\nCountries with the most military drones in the world are ranked in ascending order of their fleet size of drones.

Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet's now head over to the list of countries that have the most military drones.\n\nDrones: 412\n\nMore than half of Finland's large fleet of military drones consist of Orbiter 2-B manufactured by Israel's Aeronautics Defense Systems. These are lightweight unmanned aerial vehicles that are designed for military and security purposes, and are integrated into all eight brigade-level formations of the Finnish Army. Another potent aerial vehicle operated by Finland is Ranger, which was built as part of a joint venture between Switzerland's RUAG Aviation and Israel Aerospace Industries.\n\nDrones: 518\n\nSouth Korea is among countries with the most military drones in the world, with a sizable fleet of 514 unmanned aerial vehicles that are used for surveillance, reconnaissance, and intelligence gathering missions. Majority of the drones that are currently in operation of the South Korean military are locally produced, while some were acquired from foreign countries - including four RQ-4 Global Hawk UAV from the United States. These are manufactured by Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC).\n\nDrones: 557\n\nAustralia has a fleet of 557 drones used for military purposes, according to Power Atlas and The Drone Databook. These include 161 PD-100 Black Hornet and 350 Phantom, which are unarmed but used for military needs such as battle planning, surveillance, and intelligence gathering. The Australian Air Force also possesses between 12-16 MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles manufactured by General Atomics. Moreover, there are six MQ-4C Triton drones that are in use by the country's Navy.\n\nDrones: 591\n\nFrance is one of the countries with the most military drones in the world. Its fleet of uninhabited aerial vehicles include 210 mini Spy'Ranger UAVs developed by Thales, 11 Safran Patroller aircraft made by Sagem, and 12 MQ-9 Reaper drones it procured from the United States. According to The Center of the Study of the Drone at Bard College, France's Syst\u00e8me de Drones A\u00e9rien de la Marine (SDAM) program is working to develop an unmanned rotorcraft for frigates operated by the French Navy.\n\nDrones: 625\n\nNext up on sixth spot is India, which has a sizable fleet of 625 drones, at least. These include 600 Spylite, which were introduced in 2019, according to The Drone Databook. In addition to this, the country procured 10 Heron 1 drones from Israel for a deal worth $400 million in 2015. India also operates 15 Harop unmanned aircraft. All of the drones operated by India are of Israeli-origin.

        "title": "Indian youth duped into joining Wagner: The shadowy Russian group involved in proxy fight with US rival in Africa",
        "text": "Bengaluru: The plight of four Indian youths forced to join the Wagner Group and fight in the Ukraine war focuses light on the mercenary group funded and trained by the Russian government.\n\nThe youths, three from Kalburagi in Karnataka and one from Telangana, according to Times of India, were duped by manpower hiring agents under the guise of employment in Russia, were shanghaied into the Wagner Group, a mercenary group founded by the late Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman once close to president Vladimir Putin. They were sent to fight along with the Wagner fighters, who are engaged in combat with the Ukrainian forces along the Russian border.\n\nApparently, the four youths were misguided by recruiters under false promises of lucrative employment. The youths, who realized that they had been duped and sent into the cauldron of war, managed to contact their families, who have urged the Indian government to get them repatriated to India.\n\nThe two-year-old conflict between Russia and Ukraine has led to brutal fighting, with casualties estimated by US officials quoted by New York times, at about 5,00,000, including 10,000 civilians, a figure given by the UN.\n\nWith part of its army decimated on the battlefields, Russia, through the Wagner Group, has been trying to recruit freelance fighters for its weakened army, particularly from the developing countries like Nepal, and even India. The Indian government is allergic to its nationals fighting wars abroad, but recruiters have managed to lure as many as 15,000 fighters from Nepal.\n\nRussia has offered citizenship to foreign nationals who fight for it against Ukraine, and last month, Putin signed a decree making foreign fighters eligible to apply for Russian citizenship.\n\nThat is a hard-to-resist offer for many of the unemployed youth from developing countries, and the promise could have motivated even many Indians to be lured by Wagner recruiters, who would have promised non-military jobs, only to send the beguiled recruits to the frontline.\n\nThe fighters of Wagner Group, comprising former Russian soldiers, pardoned prisoners, volunteers and mercenaries recruited from various countries, have been in the front lines of the combat, and were instrumental in capturing the Ukrainian town of Bakhmut last May and Avdieevka last week.\n\nSome of the formations of the group, estimated to total 25,000, have been deployed in Belarus, and have been present in half a dozen African countries as military advisers and trainers. Some of the Wagner fighters have also been reported to be involved in fighting in Mali, which threw out French troops and replaced them with professional fighters from the Russian group.\n\nYevgeny Prigozhin was a former Putin confidante, and an entrepreneur with extensive business interests both in Russia and abroad, who is said to have made billions of rubles. Prigozhin, described as the western media as 'Putin's chef' as he had a catering contract with Kremlin who used his shadowy army, made up of volunteers, freed jailbirds and others to fight on the front lines in the Ukraine war. Prigozhin named his fighters Wagner Group, after the German composer, whose name was picked as the radio call ID of his deputy and close friend, Dmitry Utkin, a former air force officer, who organized the frebooting fighting formation.\n\nPrigozhin's mercenaries were in the thick of fighting in Ukraine, outside direct command of the military leadership, and his clout grew with the successes of his men, who fought with bravery and brutality, even as many of the regular military groups fell back in various sectors, thanks to bumbling tactics by the Defence command.\n\nPrigozhin became bold enough to taunt the Russian General Staff, Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Chief of Army Staff Valery Gerasimov for \"failures\" of strategy and tactics, and in June 2023, challenged Putin directly, as he set his men took over the city of Rostov and began driving towards Moscow, demanding replacement of the war leadership, and demanding more resources.\n\nPrigozhin was persuaded to negotiate with the Kremlin, with Putin promising change of military leadership, and a pardon for the rebels. As part of an agreement, Prigozhin was asked to go over to Russia's ally, Belarus, prior to further orders.\n\nTwo months after the aborted rebellion, Prigozhin was on a flight in a business jet from Moscow to St. Petersburg (formerly Leningrad), when the jet crashed, apparently because of grenades on the plane exploding. The death has not been explained, although western media has speculated that Prigozhin was lulled into a feeling of security, and was killed by the grenades planted on the plane. Utkin, Prigonzhin's trusted lieutenant, was among those killed.\n\nAfter Prigozhin's death, the Kremlin took his business empire and his fatherless fighters, and brought them under the command of the military. The formations of the group, divided into brigades, are engaged in the tough fighting.\n\nMany of the Wagner fighters, particularly senior officers, are deployed in African countries, particularly those in Francophone Africa that have seen army coups in recent years. They are assisting troops of Mali, Burkina Faso, Gabon and Niger, which have rebelled against the control by France, which is seen as exploiting their natural resources including Uranium and precious minerals, and manipulating their currency.\n\nRussia, which as the Soviet Union, used to have extensive influence with Africa's decolonized nations, is now trying to regain lost clout, and much like the west, is eyeing access to the natural resources. Part of Russia's offering of Wagner fighters to the African nations is Russian firms getting mining contracts.\n\nRussia's growing footprint in Africa would naturally worry the west, and the US has been trying to get a piece of the African cake. Central African Republic (CAR), which has been in the grip of a civil war, is one country where Wagner is entrenched, with the current president, Austin-Archange Touadera having invited the group to offer him 'advice' way back in 2015.\n\nThe US has been trying to get into countries where Wagner has been deployed, and CAR is one target. With the Russian group somewhat directionless after the death of its founder, a worried Touadera is reported to have decided to 'diversify' foreign military advisers, and is said to have been negotiating an American equivalent of Wagner, Bancroft Development Group. Bancroft is one of the five largest military contractors in the world, along with Wagner, Academi (formerly Blackwater of Iraq and Afghanistan infamy), Erinys, G4S Security, and the British Olive Group made up of former SAS personnel.\n\nThis, however, would mean coming into indirect conflict with the Russians, although both Russia and the west would like to be daggers drawn in the continent, and be drawn into fighting on behalf of one or the other of the forces involved in civil wars.\n\nUsing non-state military contractors by Russia and US in Africa, would give both countries influence in the resource-rich continent, while affording plausible deniability of the two countries being involved directly in the civil wars.\n\nBut it is their recruitment of poor youths from developing countries that is the cause for worry. With no guarantee of safety and security, the youth from poorer countries are being used as cannon fodder. Israel's recruitment of Indian youth from Punjab and Haryana, ostensibly for civilian jobs, is another area of concern that the government of India would do well to study closely.",

        "title": "Extremist anti-Bharat organizations make a beeline to get a standing in Canada's foreign interference inquiry against alleged interference by Bharat in Canadian elections",
        "text": "Even as Khalistani extremist leaders are repeatedly issuing open threats to Hindus in Canada and vandalizing Bharatiya consulates in Canada and Hindu temples, the Canadian government seems more concerned about the alleged foreign interference of Bharat in Canada's elections that putting a curb to anti-Bharat activities emanating from their land.\n\nKhalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun who is the leader of the banned Khalistani outfit Sikhs for Justice recently called upon protesting farmers of Bharat to \"use a bullet for a bullet\". He reportedly instigated farmers to take up bullets against the state in a video shared on social media and claimed that weapons were readily available at Kartarpur Sahib, Pakistan, and across the international border with Rajasthan. Even Pakistan got embarrassed by Pannun's inflammatory comments as the authorities were quick to dismiss his claims as \"a bunch of lies aimed at defaming Pakistan\".\n\nBarely a week back, Pannun had instigated Khalistani elements to infiltrate the farmers' protests and kill \"Modi's politics\" in another video that had gone viral on social media. Anti-Hindu hate sloganeering and threats to Hindus to either leave the country or face consequences are becoming a routine occurrence in Canada. The Canadian Organization for Hindu Heritage Education (COHHE) recently shared a video through its X handle. In the video, a Khalistani extremist can be seen using Hinduphobic slurs outside the Bharatiya consulate in Vancouver. The man is speaking in Punjabi in the clip, but as per the English translation, he is saying, \"Upcoming time is ours not Cow urine drinkers and dung worshippers\". The man can also be seen issuing threats to demolish the consulate and replace it with \"Khalistan embassy\".\n\nAmidst the alarming rise of Hinduphobia and anti-Bharat activities in Canada, not a single word of condemnation has come from the Canadian government. Instead, they seem to be giving further patronage and encouragement to such extremist anti-Bharat Khalistani groups operating from Canada, the US, and other western countries.\n\nSikh community groups have sought standing in the public inquiry into foreign interference currently in progress in Canada, as per various media reports. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service alleged that Bharat had potentially interfered in the country's election. The agency made the sensational claim in a recent report that the government of Bharat categorically denied. Canada had earlier accused Russia and China of interfering in its internal elections. Now, Bharat has been added to this list.\n\nIn September 2023, the government of Canada set up a Public Inquiry into alleged foreign interference in Canadian elections. Initially, the Foreign Interference Commission was supposed to conduct an inquiry into the alleged election interference by China and Russia. But it recently added Bharat to the list as it requested \"that the government of Canada's collection and production of document relating to paragraphs clause (a) (i0 (A) and (a) (i) (B) of its Terms of Reference include information and documents relating to alleged interference by India related to the 2019 and 2021 elections\".\n\nAs the Commission commences its inquiry, Sikh organizations claiming to represent diaspora groups have asked for a standing in the inquiry. The World Sikh Organization of Canada (WSO), Ontario Gurdwaras Committee (OGC), and British Columbia Gurdwaras Council (BCGC) have jointly applied for standing in the public inquiry in a letter addressed to Justice Marie-Josee Hogue, who is leading the inquiry, as per various media reports.\n\nThe World Sikh Organization of Canada, if one goes by their website, doesn't seem to have Khalistani affiliations as such, but they constantly accuse the Bharatiya government of defaming the Sikh community of Canada. In the \"Resources\" section of their website, there is a report titled \"India's Disinformation Campaign Against Canada's Sikhs\". The report accuses the Bharatiya government of running a coordinated disinformation campaign aimed at maligning the Sikh community in Canada and reviving a narrative of \"Sikh extremism\". The report accuses the Modi government of interfering in Canada's internal politics through a state-controlled network of media, think, tanks, and NGOs. The report also repeatedly emphasizes that the \"Sangh Parivar \", the parent organization of BJP has a history of oppressing minorities.\n\nIn yet another report, the World Sikh Organization of Canada targets the RSS. The report titled \"RSS Network in Canada\" insinuates that the existence of RSS in Canada is a threat to the pluralism and diversity of the nation, the standard woke rhetoric against the RSS and the Sangh Parivar.\n\nOverall, the World Sikh Organization of Canada, even though it doesn't seem to have any Khalistani affiliation as such, comes across as an anti-Bharat and anti-Hindu outfit. The website of the second organization that has applied for a Standing in the Public Inquiry against alleged foreign interference in Canadian elections, the Ontario Gurdwaras Committee lists a public report titled \"Indian Foreign Interference in Canada\" that it claims to have released jointly with the third organization that has asked for a standing in the public inquiry, the British Columbia Gurdwaras Council, that is. \"While there has been particular attention paid to China and Russia in the context of foreign interference, it is imperative that Canada pay even closer attention to supposed allies like India, who actively seek to manipulate public discourse and policy in Canada to secure their own policy objectives\", says the report.\n\nThe British Columbia Gurdwaras Council is known for its aggressive anti-Bharat posturing. The organization also seems to support the allegations that Bharat was behind the assassination of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The point is all these Sikh organizations that have reportedly applied for a standing in the Enquiry Committee against alleged foreign interference by Bharat in Canadian elections seem biased at the outset. The most important prerequisite of any inquiry committee is neutrality and lack of bias. If organizations and interest groups with a history of peddling anti-Bharat propaganda and venting out prejudiced rants against the country are given a standing in an inquiry committee, what will be the fate of that inquiry? It is anybody's guess.\n\nYet another rabid anti-Hindu and anti-Bharat propaganda group called Justice for all Canada seems to have applied for standing in the Inquiry Committee of the Canadian Foreign Interference Commission. The name of this organization is missing from the media reports that talk about various other Sikh diaspora groups applying for the standing. But the website of the Canadian Foreign Interference Commission has a section where one can download information regarding all organizations who applied for standing in the Inquiry Committee and whose application has been approved. Going by the document, it seems that the Justice for All Canada has been approved to have a standing in the inquiry committee against alleged foreign interference in Canadian elections by Bharat and others.\n\nThe 71-page document mentions the name of the \"Justice for All Canada' under the section of Diaspora groups. It says that \"Justice for All Canada (JFAC) applies for standing in the policy phase of the inquiry\". The document then briefly describes the organization and then says, \"I would grant JFAC standing in the policy phase of the Commission. I accept that it has a substantial and direct interest in the subject matter of the Inquiry and would provide a necessary contribution. In this respect, I note that there are no other Applicants that represent the Indian Canadian community. While JFAC is not an Indian-diaspora organization as such, it does appear to have experience working with that community. I believe that, if necessary, it could assist the Commission better understand impact of foreign interference on the Indian community in Canada\".\n\nFrom the document, it seems clear that Justice for All Canada has been indeed granted a standing in the Inquiry Committee. A cursory look at the website and the X handle of the organization reveals that it is an anti-Bharat coalition of Islamist and Khalistani forces. Their X handle is full of one-sided posts on the Israel-Palestine conflict accusing Israel of genocide and human rights violations. They seem to be taking a totally biased view of the situation and can thus be seen as further perpetuating antisemitism.\n\nWith regard to Bharat, their views seem to be full of extreme anti-Hindu hatred. They seem to be working hand in glove with the Bharatiya Islamists accusing the Bharatiya government of disturbing communal harmony and targeting Muslims by relentlessly razing mosques. The organization has also posted vociferously against the ban on leftist activist Harsh Mander and his NGO by the Bharatiya government.\n\nTheir anti-Bharat links become even more clear on their website. The organization has been running campaigns like \"Kashmir Action \"and \"Save India from Fascism\". The campaign Kashmir Action does vicious propaganda against the Bharatiya government's policy on Kashmir and instigates Canadians to ask their MP to demand Action from Canada on Kashmir. It's strange that organizations who are actively seeking foreign interference in Bharat's internal politics, on the contrary, accuse Bharat of doing so. It's intended as a cover-up for their own actions, it seems.\n\nThe other dramatic campaign called \"Save India from Fascism\" asks Canadians to \"Tell Prime Minister to Condemn Genocide \"and \"Tell Local MP To Raise Genocide Issue in Parliament\".\n\nAll this goes on to show the sorry state of affairs in Canada and how the state seems to be at the total mercy of the powerful nexus of Khalistanis and Islamists. These rabid anti-Hindu and anti-Bharat groups seem to have taken over the politics of Canada and the politicians of the country fail to raise their voice against any of this either out of fear or due to vote bank politics.\n\nIt's high time Bharat becomes proactive in countering anti-Bharat propaganda peddled jointly by the Canadian government and such extremist groups patronized by them. Rather, it's high time Bharat formally accuses Canada of interfering in its internal politics.",

        "title": "Does the American army's future lie in Europe or Asia?",
        "text": "T was pivotal for America's army. The force was battered and broken from Vietnam. In January the defence secretary announced the end of conscription; two months later the last combat troops left Vietnam. But the Arab-Israeli war which broke out on Yom Kippur in October planted the seeds of renewal. The lessons of that war, absorbed by American officers sent to Israel, helped reshape America's army into the modern and professional force which would vanquish Iraq in 1991.\n\nToday's generals, who came of age during that transformation, are keenly aware of the resonance. \"There's a loose analogy between the early 1970s and the army of Desert Storm,\" says General James Rainey, who leads the army's Future Command, \"and the army which invaded Iraq in the early 2000s and where we need to be in 2040.\" Two decades of war in Afghanistan and Iraq wore out troops, equipment and ideas. A recruitment shortage remains unresolved. Now the rise of China and the lessons from the war in Ukraine have prompted introspection, renewal and reform.\n\nAmong army civilian and military leaders there are three big unsettled questions, according to people familiar with those debates. One is whether profound shifts in the character of war, some evident in Ukraine, might render ground forces less important, if not irrelevant.\n\nA second is how to balance resources between Asia and Europe (Asia being the Pentagon's priority, and Europe where Russia is rearming fast). The army can prepare for conflicts in both places, but it cannot actually wage those wars at the same time -- and it is no longer asked to do so. The 2018 National Defence Strategy ended the \"two war\" standard, a change accepted by the Biden administration.\n\nThat leads to a third question, and the most existential for the army. What, beyond the provision of logistics and air defence, would be the role of a ground force in a future war in the Pacific?\n\nWhen General Randy George, the army's chief of staff, was recently asked for book recommendations, he cited \"The Arms of the Future\" by Jack Watling, a young British analyst. The book describes how in recent rounds of Warfighter, a big annual exercise led by America, combat brigades facing increasingly good sensors and longer-range and deadlier munitions took huge losses, emerging with 20% combat effectiveness. Artillery devastates infantry and armour well before they can get within sight of the enemy.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has reinforced those findings. Some argue that America's army, better trained and armed than Ukraine's, and with air cover, would fare better. General Rainey assumes the worst. \"We're going to fight under constant observation,\" he says, \"and in constant contact of some form. There is no break. There is no sanctuary.\" He says American \"lessons learned\" teams were in place three days before the invasion to collect observations. They will have had some nasty surprises. American-made -guided shells and rockets at first worked well; more recently, they have struggled against Russian jamming.\n\nThe army recognises that whereas it could once patiently muster its forces before launching a large offensive -- as it did against Iraq in 1991 and 2003 -- it now has to prioritise dispersal, mobility and concealment. The drone attack which killed three soldiers in Jordan on January 28th was the first successful attack on American troops by aircraft since the Korean war. Katie Crombe, an army officer, and John Nagl, of the Army War College in Pennsylvania, note in a recent paper that Ukraine's battalion command posts comprise seven soldiers who dig into the ground and move twice daily. \"That standard\", they warn, pointing to stubborn habits of more static command posts, \"will be hard for the Army to achieve.\"\n\nThe commanders of battalions (about 1,000 soldiers) and brigades (a few thousand), the core units of combat in Afghanistan and Iraq, would be consumed by this intense fighting in a way they were not during counterinsurgency missions. The army is thus reorganising so that more of the burden of planning, logistics, command and control, and long-range firepower falls on divisions -- larger formations typically led by two-star generals which stand farther back from the front lines and have more time and space to orchestrate the frenetic battles of the future.\n\nWhat remains unsettled, says Billy Fabian, a former infantry officer and Pentagon planner, is how, precisely, the army's combat forces should be organised for future wars: the balance between firepower on the one hand, dominant in Ukraine, and so-called manoeuvre elements, such as infantry and armour, on the other. \"Fighting land wars is the army's raison d'\u00eatre,\" he says, \"and Ukraine raises tough questions that challenge deeply ingrained elements core to the army's self-conception.\"\n\nHanging over these reforms is the larger question of where the army will be asked to fight. National defence strategies published by the Trump and Biden administrations instruct the Pentagon to focus on China. Yet the army increased its footprint in Europe after Russia's first invasion of Ukraine in 2014. It has since reinforced the continent with a corps and division headquarters, an infantry and armour brigade, a rocket artillery battalion and numerous other support forces. In contrast, relatively few new forces have flowed into Asia.\n\nFor years the army's principal role in the Pacific was to guard bases, provide air defence and handle logistics. To the extent it was a \"manoeuvre\" force, in military parlance, it was focused on North Korea. Other services have looked down their noses at it. \"The navy has a stranglehold on the leadership of Indo-Pacific Command,\" says Stacie Pettyjohn of the Centre for a New American Security, a think-tank in Washington. \"They see the army only in a supporting role in a maritime theatre.\"\n\nGeneral Charles Flynn, the commander of the Army Pacific, vigorously rebuts such ideas. \"Humans have this unique tendency to live on land,\" he says. \"At the end of the day, decisions are going to be made by the pointy end of a gun.\" The primacy of land is as true in Asia as it is in Europe, he argues, not least because the region's largest countries, like India and Indonesia, have military forces dominated by armies. By building ties to them in peacetime, the army can position itself to project military power westward.\n\nThe growing pace of exercises (more than 40 take place annually) is a core part of that. General Flynn points to the examples of Talisman Sabre in Australia and Garuda Shield in Indonesia. Both were once relatively modest army-to-army exercises. They have grown and now involve the navy and air force. Both also involved the army's Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Centre, in essence physical and virtual training equipment that can be deployed around the region to do things which could only have been done at a large base in Louisiana. Such drills are morphing into a near-permanent presence: the army is deployed in the region for eight months of the year.\n\nAlongside that is a reimagining of how the army would fight. The premise is that China has optimised its forces to attack American satellites, ships and air bases. \"What it's not designed against\", says General Bernard Harrington, \"is to find, fix and finish land formations that are distributed, mobile and networked.\" That has prompted the creation of three experimental \"multi-domain task forces\", or s, the first of which is focused on Asia and commanded by General Harrington.\n\nEach has four battalions which can deploy small units along the first island chain which runs from Japan to the Philippines. The idea is that these can fight not just on land -- soldier v soldier, tank v tank -- but across domains. Imagine that America needs to target a Chinese ship. The 's \"effects\" battalion might jam the vessel's radar and hack its networks; if that does not neutralise the ship, it makes it more likely that anti-ship missiles launched by a \"fires\" battalion will get through. The force's long-range hypersonic missiles, which arrived last year, have a range of nearly 3,000km -- enough to reach from Japan to Taiwan, or from the Philippines to the South China Sea.\n\nInitial experiments with the s have shown promise, though some are sceptical that this high-tech vision of war would survive contact with reality. Two s are currently devoted to Asia, with a third for Europe. The original plan envisioned a total of five, with an additional one in the Arctic and one for global tasks.\n\nAll this would seem to offer a definitive answer to the army's identity crisis: Asia first. Inside the Department of the Army, nestled within the Pentagon, there are doubts, though. One question is whether its own plans mesh with those of the armed services as a whole. \"The army still feels marginalised in the Pacific,\" says Ms Pettyjohn. Another is whether the army itself has pivoted ruthlessly enough. Its fleet of water craft has shrunk dramatically in recent years, for instance. \"Water craft are an absolute indicator of true commitment to the Pacific,\" says J.P. Clark, another Army War College professor. \"They are quite expensive, only really useful for that theatre, and absolutely essential.\"\n\nThe s themselves remain \"niche\" formations, argues Mr Fabian. The largest allocated to the region is the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii, he points out, a light-infantry division. \"It seems like the army is trying to have it both ways,\" he says. \"Talk about fires and air defence for the Pacific, but stay a combined-arms force organised for close combat like it's always been.\" The army hedges its bets, says an insider, because it rarely wages the war it expects.\n\nTrade-offs abound. Short-range artillery is vital for Europe; less so in Asia. \"I just don't know what you'd fire a 155-round at out in the Pacific other than the water,\" quipped a top Pentagon official recently. The army will have to make firm choices in the next year or two, say officials. In part that is because it is creating more units than it can reliably man. The army expected to finish last year short of 10,000 recruits, a 15% shortfall and the second consecutive year of under-enlistment. Much of that is the result of America's tight labour market, but it also reflects waning enthusiasm for military service, and for combat arms in particular.\n\nThe fall in the size of the \"individual ready reserve\" -- reservists not allocated to a unit -- from 450,000 in 1994 to 76,000 in 2018 worsens the problem. Ukraine shows how intense wars tend to chew up regular armies, requiring an infusion of citizens with military experience. Today's shortage of combat soldiers is tomorrow's shortage of reservists. Ms Crombe and Mr Nagl are among those who have floated the notion of \"partial conscription\", an idea backed by just 20% of Americans. Now, as in the pivotal moments of the mid-1970s, the army finds itself wrestling with profound questions over its size, shape and purpose: questions that will eventually touch, as they did back then, its relationship to American society. \u25a0",

Medium impact is seen on crude oil and pharma\n\nThe Red Sea crisis has deepened further since November after the attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on the international route, preventing shipping companies to carry on trade.\n\nIndia, which uses the Red Sea route through the Suez Canal to trade with Europe, North America, North Africa and parts of West Asia, exports $64 billion worth of items, including plastic, rice and garments that could get impacted in the Suez Canal crisis, according to a survey by the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO).\n\nAlthough India has registered a 3.1% rise in January in outbound shipments, but for how long can it sustain growth in the ongoing crisis needs to be looked at.\n\nIran-backed Houthis rebels have been attacking commercial vessels in the Bal-el-Mandeb strait between the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa since November in response to Israel's bombardment in Gaza.\n\nThe attacks escalated after the US used helicopters from its Navy warships to stop an attack by militants on a ship owned by Maersk, leading the Danish shipping line to pause all shipment, according to The Guardian.\n\nThe Suez Canal handles 12% of global trade, with half of the freight shipped through the canal is made up of containerised goods. The route is also an important passage for shipments of oil from the Persian Gulf to Europe and North America.\n\nFor India, trade through the Red Sea accounts for around 50% of India's exports worth Rs 18 lakh crore and about 30% of imports amounting to Rs 17 lakh crore last fiscal, according to Crisil Ratings.\n\nWith around 35% of Basmati production is shipped to Europe, West Asia, North America and Africa via the Red Sea route, Indian exporters are feeling the pressure of high freight costs due to which the rice are now being sold in the domestic market.\n\nDue to extended shipment timelines and high freight costs, high impact is also seen on fertilisers as India heavily depends on West Asia, especially Israel and Jordan, for it.\n\nMedium impact is seen on crude oil, pharma and shipping, according to Crisil. India depends on Russia (37%), Iraq (21%) and Saudi Arabia (14%) for crude oil.\n\nCrisil, however, said the Red Sea crisis will not affect the steel sector as 95% of the demand is met through domestic supply.\n\nIndia's tea sector also remained resilient with exports rising 6.92%, a three-month high, to $64.90 million in January 2024 despite the Red Sea crisis.\n\nIf the tensions continue in the Red Sea, shipping contracts, 80% of which are long term, can get affected.\n\nAccording to Israeli transport minister Miri Regev, a new route for goods to be sent to Israel from India bypassing the Red Sea could be used. Regev, who posted a video on X, was at the Mundra Port in Gujarat, and described the new route.\n\nThis route will allow goods to move from Mundra to ports in the UAE such as Dubai's Jebel Ali Port and land through Saudi Arabia and Jordan to Israel. A major part of the land transport will be carried out by trucks, she explained.\n\nIn an earlier post on X, Regev said the land route will shorten the transport period by 12 days, and significantly reduce the current waiting time.",

Neither will there be much of an impact on the trade front since most imports are from East Asia,\" Crisil said in its February 2024 research note.\n\nUnlike FIEO, Crisil sees minimal impact on India's textiles industry in the near term with about three-fourths of the sector oriented towards the domestic market and the crucial festive season behind us.\n\nAnother trade body that primarily represents small and medium exporters expects a relatively moderate impact versus FIEO as it sees outbound shipments amounting to $25 billion getting affected due to the disruptions and delays with freight companies taking the longer route around Africa to reach the west, or waiting at nearby ports for safe passage through the Suez Canal.\n\nEven India's tea sector remained resilient with exports rising 6.92 percent, a three-month high, to $64.90 million in January 2024 despite the Red Sea crisis.\n\nPK Bhattacharjee, Secretary General, Tea Association of India, says this is largely due to the government's intervention, which led to banks providing maximum credit limits and Export Credit Guarantee Corporation (ECGC) keeping insurance premium rates unchanged despite the spike in shipping costs.\n\nCost crisis\n\nAn unanimous impact of the Houthi attacks has been the rise in overall shipping costs.\n\nRerouting around the Cape of Good Hope due to the Red Sea crisis is delaying shipments by two to four weeks, which is extending delivery window dates and affecting cash flow.\n\nIn its survey, FIEO revealed that cotton yarn exporters are facing a 50-600 percent increase in costs for their shipments to Bangladesh, Europe, and Egypt.\n\nThe Drewry World Container Index, which serves as a composite measure of container freight rates, reached $3,786 per 40-foot container in the week up to February 8, up 90 percent when compared with the same week last year, and 167 percent more than average 2019 (pre-pandemic) rates of $1,420.\n\nSoaring freight and elongated transit times are trapping working capital, thereby increasing the demand for more resources when it comes to storage or inventory. The extended cycle, with higher costs and interest outlays, may ultimately reduce demand,\" FIEO noted in the survey.\n\nFor Indian exporters, the threat of order cancellations looms large.\n\n\"My company Ceekey Global Trading in Calicut was regularly supplying Basmati rice to a buyer in Glasgow at a normal freight of $1,400-1,600 from Mumbai to Felixstowe in the UK. Today the current ocean freight on the route is nearly $3,100-3,200. The buyer cancelled this order since he cannot afford the cost,\" Munshid Ali, Secretary, Kerala Exporters' Forum, told Moneycontrol.\n\nAs attacks on vessels traversing through the Red Sea, which began mid-November 2023, continue, exporters in India fear a prolonged crisis that runs the risk of escalating.\n\n'Give more support'\n\nGiven these concerns, there have been demands from the government to go beyond what has been offered so far in helping exporters manage operational costs, including, subsidies and low-interest loans as India faces comparatively higher interest costs than China.\n\nBhattacharya articulates this fear well.\n\n\"Despite the tremendous support from the government, tea exporters are frightened, if the Red Sea crisis, that is Houthi attacks, continues, the situation could worsen,\" he said.",

        "title": "Refusing evacuation, those who remain in Kiryat Shmona cling to home and brace for 'hell'",
        "text": "Examining the bombed-out fa\u00e7ade of the Center 8 shopping mall in Kiryat Shmona, Natali Eitan calmly lit a cigarette.\n\nA resident of an adjacent apartment building, she spoke to The Times of Israel on Tuesday while sitting on a bench overlooking the impact site of one of the hundreds of rockets that Hezbollah gunmen and other terrorists in Lebanon have launched at Kiryat Shmona since October 8, a day after the outbreak of war between the Hamas terror group and Israel in Gaza.\n\nHezbollah and other terrorists have killed 16 Israelis in a limited but escalating exchange of fire that has claimed the lives of about 200 Hezbollah members, according to statements by the terror group. On Thursday, a salvo of more than 20 rockets hit Kiryat Shmona, damaging multiple buildings. On Wednesday, a rare rocket attack on Safed killed one soldier and wounded eight others, triggering a relatively strong reaction by Israel, which struck deeper north in Lebanon than before, conducting airstrikes near the city of Sidon. Arab-language media attributed to Israel an alleged airstrike in Damascus on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe war has resulted in about 120,000 internally displaced people in Israel, roughly evenly split between southerners who left communities under assault by Hamas and other Gaza-based terrorists, and evacuees from northern locales targeted by Hezbollah terrorists and their junior accomplices in Lebanon.\n\nEvacuees on short trips back home were horrified by the reality of wartime in Kiryat Shmona, a once-vibrant city about a mile (2 kilometers) from the Lebanon border, that was turned into a scarred ghost town after the departure of 80% of its 23,000 residents. Yet, as in other evacuated cities, thousands remain, citing a mix of reasons, including wanting to receive the government's generous resettlement grant; emotional attachment; and ideological Zionistic convictions.\n\nEitan, a 45-year-old mother of three who immigrated, to Israel from Lithuania in 2001, stayed in Kiryat Shmona because her apartment is the only place she feels at home, she told this reporter on the bench, situated about 100 yards away from the explosion at the mall. The rocket shot clean through an external wall and the blowback ripped through a parked army truck, shattering the mall's glass fa\u00e7ade.\n\nThe backdrop didn't bother Eitan, she said.\n\n\"A rocket could hit you at any second here, but probably won't. I live with this knowledge so I'm not intimidated by the evidence for it,\" said Eitan, whose home was bombed during the previous round of hostilities with Hezbollah in the 2006 Second Lebanon War.\n\nMultiple evacuees, meanwhile, reported feeling too afraid to return yet to Kiryat Shmona, where they spoke to this reporter while stocking up on household items to take to their government-funded accommodations farther away from the border.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to be living here now,\" said Leah Singson, a 14-year-old junior high student who was in Kiryat Shmona with her mother Tuesday to fetch clothes and kitchen utensils for their apartment in Nof Hagalil, a city in the Lower Galilee.\n\nThe Singson family of seven - members of the Bnei Menashe Jewish community who immigrated in 2014 from eastern India - miss Kiryat Shmona, said Leah, who had attended the city's Chabad school for girls.\n\n\"I would've loved to just walk around here but everything's closed, no one I know is here. It's not fun right now,\" Leah said as she waited with her mother for an outbound bus.\n\nRicky Hadad, a mother of seven who evacuated to a hotel in Tel Aviv, stayed in town this week in an attempt to move back permanently.\n\n\"But I'm too scared, the rockets freak me out and I can't sleep. On some nights I ended up calling one of my children in panic to come get me out of here. So I'm returning to the hotel even though being there depresses me. I'm climbing up the walls,\" she said before asking for help moving a duffle bag to the central bus station.\n\n\"Stayers\" and evacuees alike said they felt abandoned, perplexed, or angry about the decision to evacuate or how it's being pursued.\n\nEitan, an assembly line technician at the Kiryat Shmona-based Electro Galil electronics factory, supports the decision to evacuate but laments insufficient provisions for workers rendered jobless. She's about to get her last unemployment payment next month, forcing her to either find a job in Kiryat Shmona - an unlikely prospect in a city and area whose economy the war has essentially shut down -- or join the evacuees and try to get work in the center, where her two daughters are living in government-funded accommodations.\n\n\"I'm being basically forced out because of government policy, or lack thereof,\" said Eitan.\n\nOfficially, she clarified, she is also an evacuee, registered as residing at an apartment hotel with her daughters in Bat Yam near Tel Aviv. Her son is a soldier serving on Mount Hermon. But she misses Kiryat Shmona, so she spends half her time here.\n\n\"I love it here. I love the quiet, the mountain air,\" explained Eitan, whose boyfriend is also staying in Kiryat Shmona, where he works.\n\nIsrael's northernmost city, Kiryat Shmona was a relatively impoverished community even before the war. The average monthly salary here was about NIS 10,000 ($2,772), 20% lower than the national level. This reality, coupled with the relative paucity of employment opportunities and other problems plaguing Israel's so-called periphery - the cities and towns outside its center - have impeded the city's development regardless of its security issues.\n\nSome locals described the government's measured response to Hezbollah's attacks on Kiryat Shmona as an extension of what they perceive as broader neglect by decision-makers of communities in Kiryat Shmona and other impoverished or remote places.\n\n\"We're on the periphery both when it comes to infrastructure like hospitals and schools, but it turns out we're also marginal when it comes to security,\" said Michael Mor, a 22-year-old resident of Kibbutz Gonen who works in Kiryat Shmona. \"They won't deter Hezbollah from sniping at us, and they won't even build us bomb shelters,\" said Mor, noting that hundreds of apartments throughout Kiryat Shmona are in old buildings without sheltered areas.\n\nThe evacuation, multiple residents said, will exacerbate problems because it's pushing many young, promising residents to leave for good.\n\nEitan's eldest, who is 27, \"isn't coming back to Kiryat Shmona. She has a new boyfriend in Tel Aviv. She found work there. The war has pushed her out and there are many young people like her,\" her mother said.\n\n\"The evacuation is a huge mistake,\" said Mor from Kibbutz Gonen, who is the only employee of the only open liquor store in Kiryat Shmona. One of his evacuated friends from Kiryat Shmona also found work in Tel Aviv, earning twice his Kiryat Shmona salary. \"So he's never coming back. The war just facilitated his move to the center,\" Mor said.\n\nLocals in Kiryat Shmona have become experts at identifying and localizing the thuds of war that constantly echo throughout the city.\n\n\"If there's a whistle before the thud, that's usually a Hezbollah anti-tank missile,\" Mor says in cataloging the noises. \"An echo and then a thud means our outbound artillery. And when a salvo hits, oh, man, you'll know it, there's no mistaking those noises.\"\n\nMost of the traffic on empty streets here is public transportation buses whose drivers diligently follow their pre-war routes and schedules even though the vehicles are typically empty, or transporting only a handful of passengers.\n\nOne of the residents who remained is Yuri Giller, an 82-year-old veteran of the Russian army who immigrated to Israel in the 1990s from Yekaterinburg with his two sons. Hamas terrorists murdered one of his sons, Yaroslav Giller, 28, at the music festival in Re'im. Yuri's elder son, Alex, is living in Haifa.\n\nGiller is struggling to cope with the \"very deep pain\" over his son's death, he said, but fear of rockets \"is not a problem\" for him, he said, adding: \"It's mostly a psychological weapon.\"\n\nYaroslav Giller was among some 1,200 people murdered by Hamas terrorists on October 7 in Israel. The terrorists abducted another 253 into Gaza, among other war crimes and atrocities. Of those, only about 100 have been released in a prisoner swap that ended in December. The Israel Defense Forces invaded the Gaza Strip on October 27 as part of a still-ongoing military campaign whose stated goals are to topple Hamas and retrieve the hostages.\n\nNearly 30,000 Palestinians have died as a result of the operation, according to unverified data from Palestinian sources, which do not differentiate between civilians and terrorists, of whom Israel says it has killed some 12,000.\n\nThinking of his late son, Giller sobs briefly. Asked about the practicalities of living in Kiryat Shmona - the availability of medical services, food and the supply of water and electricity - he regained his composure and stiff upper lip. \"Everything's fine. Life goes on. The clinic's open, there's a grocery store, there's water and power and there's also money from social security,\" he said, referencing the resettlement grant, which starts at about NIS 6,000 ($1,650) per household each month.\n\nThis was also the message coming out of a gathering Tuesday by more than 70 tech startups in Kibbutz Mahanaim in the war-hit Upper Galilee. Initiated by entrepreneur and investor Erel Margalit and his Kiryat Shmona-based Margalit Startup City Galilee business incubator, the meeting was about rehabilitating the region's budding tech scene and repopulating the area generally.\n\nMargalit told the startup crowd that unless Israel makes \"decisive choices\" about Hezbollah, it will \"falter in its ability to orchestrate a return to order here in the north and bring our people back home.\"\n\nSome locals here share Margalit's preference for a decisive move on Hezbollah, even if it means what one of them, Michael Mor, described as \"unleashing hellfire\" on Kiryat Shmona and beyond.\n\n\"We've let this monster grow on our border, and now the price for removing it will be very high,\" Mor said. \"But unless we pay up, we're done for everywhere. They'll come for us in Tel Aviv after they're done driving us out of the Galilee,\" he said.\n\nMor for one vows to remain one of Kiryat Shmona's \"stayers,\" even if full-scale fighting erupts and Hezbollah rains down thousands of rockets.\n\n\"Come what may, I'm not leaving the region. I'm not abandoning my home,\" Mor said.",

        "text": "The conflict in Israel remains in place, although that is unlikely to adversely affect the crude oil supply. However, the bigger development has been the US government's efforts to continue to target Iranian proxies in the Middle East in retaliation for a suicide drone strike in Jordan, said ICICI Bank Global Markets in its latest report.\n\nHouthi militants in Yemen continue to target shipping vessels in the Red Sea, despite US airstrikes, raising concerns about further disruptions to supplies from the region.\n\nAlso Read: IOC, HPCL, BPCL shares baking-in high margins, steep premiums, says CLSA\n\nThe crisis in the Red Sea shipping route began after Yemen-based Houthi rebels launched frequent attacks on commercial shipping vessels plying through the route in November as a fallout of the Israeli-Palestine war, which started in early October 2023.\n\nSo far, supply disruptions haven't materialised significantly, which is limiting the upside in Brent crude oil prices. However, two key risks persist potential disruptions in crude transportation through the Strait of Hormuz (20 mbpd) or the Suez Canal (5 mbpd), accounting for a combined 25% of total oil supply, and the involvement of major oil producers like Iran, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia in a conflict. Although the likelihood of such an event remains low for now, as stated by ICICI Bank Global Markets.\n\nAs far as global supply is concerned, ICICI Bank Global Markets said that there has been a notable drop in OPEC+ crude oil production in January, marking the steepest plunge in six months.\n\nHowever, the decline fell short of the approximately 700 kbpd in cuts pledged by the group for Q1 2024. In January, OPEC+ crude output witnessed a decline of 420 kbpd. Factors contributed to the production decline, including protests leading to the shutdown of Libya's Sharara oil field as well as voluntary cuts by Kuwait and Iraq.\n\nDespite agreeing to significant output reductions at the last OPEC+ meeting, both countries exceeded their quotas in January.\n\nAlso Read: Petroleum exports drop sharply as West tightens squeeze on Russia\n\nThe shortfall in January's production cuts, as per ICICI Bank Global Markets, may impact OPEC+ members' market share, especially amidst surging crude output from non-OPEC countries like the US, Canada, Guyana, and Brazil.\n\nOn aggregate, the global supply of crude dropped by 1.6 mbpd on a sequential basis in January, which was not enough to offset the decline witnessed in demand. The net result was an excess supply of 0.6 mbpd in the crude oil physical markets in January 2024, it stated.\n\n\"Our global demand-side projections for crude oil have remained unchanged from the past month and reflect our expectations of a global soft landing. We see demand picking by 1.1 mbpd in 2024 compared to 1.9 mbpd witnessed over 2023, reflecting sluggish global growth projections for 2024 of 2.8% YoY from earlier 3.0%,\" said ICICI Bank Global Markets.\n\nIt expects emerging markets (EMs) to drive the demand higher, led by India and China, and it projects US demand to pick up marginally, while demand in Europe is expected to remain flat.\n\nAlso Read: India oil product demand up 8.2% in January, says report\n\n\"The risks to the demand outlook remain fairly balanced at this point in time, depending on the materialisation of Chinese stimulus driving demand higher and the lagged impact of monetary tightening leading to a much more acute slowdown in global growth than we expect,\" it added.\n\nICICI Bank Global Markets has maintained its trading range for Brent crude prices between USD 75/bbl and USD 85/bbl. This is based on the expectation that physical markets will likely remain oversupplied by approximately 0.1 mbpd.\n\nTheir forecasts implicitly assume that OPEC+ members will extend production cuts beyond April 2024. If that does not happen, it would imply a higher net supply surplus, limiting further upside potential from current levels. It says that the ongoing geo-political tensions could continue to drive interim volatility, keeping prices elevated in the process.\n\nAlso Read: Government marginally raises windfall tax on domestic crude oil\n\nThere were also episodes of US commercial crude oil inventory drawing higher than expected, giving hopes that demand would normalise in the upcoming months. However, the upside bias has remained capped, reflecting expectations of an oversupplied physical market, as stated by ICICI Bank Global Markets.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations given in this article are those of individual analysts.

        "text": "Illustrative: This handout picture courtesy of the US Navy taken on October 19, 2023, shows the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Carney (DDG 64) defeating a combination of Houthi missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles in the Red Sea. (Aaron Lau / US NAVY / AFP)\n\nBy Saloni Salil 22 February 2024\n\nS. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, NTU Singapore\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nAt a time of increased tensions in the Middle East as the Hamas-Israel war in Gaza continues, this commentary delves into the escalating threats posed by Houthi attacks on shipping in the southern part of the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden/Arabian Sea. The Indian Navy's role as a net security provider in safeguarding vital sea lanes and critical choke points, as well as in preserving regional stability, becomes indispensable.\n\nCOMMENTARY\n\nThe Houthis, an Iran-backed rebel group, who \"declare themselves to be part of the Iranian-led axis of resistance against Israel, the US and the wider West\", has been instrumental in creating havoc in the Red Sea, disrupting global trade and threatening maritime security in the region.\n\nOn 19 November 2023, Houthi commandos landed a helicopter on the Galaxy Leader cargo vessel as it passed through the southern section of the Red Sea. The vessel was redirected towards Hodeidah port in Yemen and the crew seized.\n\nAs the crisis deepened, the number of Houthi attacks escalated to more than 30 ship attacks, approximately 13 of them by missiles or drones. The latest of these attacks was on 12 February 2024, when an American cargo vessel was struck causing it minor damage.\n\nThese incidents have had a double impact where, on one hand, they have led to significant disruptions in global trade, threatening global supply chains and logistics, increasing overall prices of energy, food and other commodities, and, on the other hand, causing heavy militarisation of the Red Sea.\n\nConcerns are now growing over Houthi threats to international internet traffic and financial data transmissions, with Yemeni telecom providers warning of the terrorist group's plans to disrupt Red Sea submarine cables. On 4 February 2024, Yemen's General Telecommunications Company, which is linked to the UN-recognised government, released a statement \"condemning the Houthis' threats to target international marine cables [where] approximately 17% of the world's internet traffic is carried along fibre pipes in the Red Sea\".\n\nThus, maritime security in the Red Sea is of grave importance and the absence of it comes with enormous consequences not only for the littoral states but globally. According to freight analytics firm Vortexa, the Suez Canal transported almost nine million barrels of oil per day in the first half of 2023. S&P reported that approximately 15 per cent of products imported into Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa arrived by sea from Asia and the Gulf. This figure includes 21.5 per cent of refined oil and more than 13 per cent of crude oil, making the Red Sea critical for global trade.\n\nThe Red Sea serves as a key maritime route connecting Europe to the Indian Ocean and the Indo-Pacific region. It also hosts the Suez Canal, one of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. Any disruption to traffic in the Red Sea, such as conflicts or blockades, can have significant implications for global trade which are now being felt.\n\nInternational Response to the Houthi Attacks\n\nThe international response to the current geopolitical environment in the Red Sea has been mixed. In December 2023, the United States declared Operation Prosperity Guardian, a multinational maritime coalition aimed at upholding freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. Over 20 nations, including the United Kingdom and Singapore, are participating, with Bahrain being the sole participant from the Middle East. The UK has deployed three ships to the area. The European Union is set to initiate a distinct maritime mission.\n\nOn 10 January 2024, while adopting resolution 2722, the United Nations Security Council condemned the Houthi attacks, demanded that they cease their attacks, recognised the right to freedom of navigation, and highlighted the arms embargo on the Houthis. China and Russia abstained, arguing that the US response risked exacerbating the Israel-Hamas conflict, which should instead be resolved by a ceasefire. Representatives from the UK and the US supported the measure.\n\nOn 11 January 2024, as reported in a research briefing by the UK House of Commons Library, the US and UK launched air and naval strikes on Houthi sites in Yemen, with further strikes on 22 January. Since 11 January, the US has also launched eight separate strikes against the Houthis.\n\nIndian Navy's Contribution to Regional Stability\n\nFor India, being a resident power in the Indian Ocean Region, ensuring unhindered trade via the Gulf of Aden is crucial. The Indian Navy has responded quite vigorously and effectively to a succession of pirate attacks, demonstrating an increase in the frequency of hostage rescues undertaken in comparison to previous years.\n\nAlthough India did not join the US-led task force in the Red Sea, which focused on attacks by the Houthis, it has deployed at least a dozen warships east of the Red Sea, its largest-ever deployment in the region, to deal with pirates and has investigated more than 250 vessels.\n\nIn December 2023, the Indian Navy deployed at least four warships, which were armed with BrahMos land attack missiles and surface-to-air missiles, anti-submarine warfare-capable helicopters, Sea Guardian drones, and P8I aircraft for surveillance.\n\nIn January 2024, the Indian Navy's INS Sumitra rescued 19 Pakistani crew members from a ship that was attacked by pirates off the east coast of Somalia. The same warship also responded to a hijacked Iranian vessel off Somalia, rescuing its 17 crew members. Additionally, the INS Visakhapatnam conducted a boarding operation on the Marshall Island-flagged Marlin Luanda, offering assistance to the 22 Indian and one Bangladeshi crew member on the tanker.\n\nGiven the recent attacks on merchant vessels, the Indian Navy has significantly increased its surveillance apparatus in the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden by deploying frontline destroyers and frigates. Aerial surveillance by long-range maritime patrol aircraft and remotely piloted aircraft has been enhanced to provide a complete maritime domain awareness.\n\nIn its role as a regional security provider, the Indian Navy is progressively demonstrating its capacity not only to safeguard its interests but also to instil confidence in neighbouring stakeholders by expressing its capability and readiness to assume regional responsibilities. With its strategic deployments, diplomatic standing, and commitment to regional security, the Indian Navy will continue to play a crucial role in the Indian Ocean Region.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ongoing hostilities between Israel and Hamas, and between the Houthis and international shipping in the Red Sea, could escalate beyond the region. If this should happen, the repercussions and implications for maritime security in the region and the global economy would be far-reaching. This underscores the need for sustained international attention and collaborative efforts to address the multifaceted challenges at hand. In this, the Indian Navy has an important role to play safeguarding vital sea lanes and critical chokepoints and contributing to regional stability.",

        "text": "Having failed miserably in the propaganda that the Ukraine war will kill Russia militarily and economically, the United States has shifted focus to Beijing and China's economic downfall. But the US would not talk of its escalating external debt that rose to an unprecedented level of $34.191 trillion in January 2024, with a monthly interest rate of 3.15%.\n\nMoreover, America's war mongering has brought European countries, as also the United Kingdom, into recession. Even US-supported Israel, having killed 28,775 people and injuring 68,552 in Gaza, is experiencing a downfall in GDP.\n\nThe US-led West excels in generating refugees by creating conditions in countries which they or their allies invade or subject to insurgency. Thereafter, bully countries to accept refugees for resettlement, ignoring the damage, destruction and bloodshed.\n\nHasn't this happened in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Libya and Lebanon? Isn't this the aim of the Israeli offensive in Rafah, to shove over a million refugees into Egypt? Shouldn't the propaganda blurring the lines between Hitler's extermination of Jews and Netanyahu's extermination of Palestinians in Gaza ring a bell in conscious minds?\n\nNot content with the ongoing wars, America is seeking new fronts to initiate conflict. United States Secretary of State Antony Blinken is poking his nose into Central Asia.\n\nMeeting Central Asian diplomats in Kazakhstan on March 1, 2024, Blinken warned that no country, particularly those that have traditionally been in Moscow's orbit, can afford to ignore the threats posed by the Russian invasion, including to the international \"rules-based order\" and the global economy.\n\nThe fact is that the Ukraine war is a war of the US against Russia using Ukraine as a proxy. This has been said umpteen times by US scholars, strategists and former military and intelligence professionals.\n\nThe latest is Jeffery D Sachs, American economist, professor at Columbia University, popular writer on international relations and special adviser to three UN secretaries general, who says the conflict in Ukraine was provoked by the US attempts to expand NATO.\n\nHe further says that the American foreign policy is a \"fraud based on corruption\" and the leaders of the European Union are subordinate to Washington and serve the US military-industrial complex.\n\nMoreover, how would Blinken explain this so-called \"Rules-Based Order\", when it is on record, besides other proofs, that the ISIS was created by the US, used them for operations, and ISIS casualties were being treated in Israel (\n\nIn fact, the CIA, MI6, MIT and Mossad created ISIS, involving Jordanian intelligence as well, to keep the Turkish and Israeli borders safe. Presently, ISIS cadres are reportedly being pumped into northern Afghanistan to pressure Central Asia and ensure ISIS does not help Hamas.\n\nDuring their last summit in San Francisco in December 2023, attended by a dozen officials from both sides, Chinese President Xi Jinping bluntly told the POTUS Joe Biden that Beijing will reunify Taiwan with mainland China. So, it is only a question of when and how. But the US, which has historically shown the propensity to wage war on countries that cannot hit back mainland America, is unlikely to get into direct conflict with China or Russia, no matter the rhetoric and muscle flexing.\n\nAt the same time, the US seeks conflict in the Indo-Pacific, including in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), to extract strategic and economic mileage, without getting directly involved and furthering its national interests. The apparent aim is to push regional powers, like India, into conflict.\n\nBiden's blue-eyed diplomat, Eric Garcetti, was posted to India as the US ambassador two years after he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during his confirmation that in India he would bring up human rights and discrimination such as via the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) as a \"core\" piece of his engagement rather than as an obligation. Also, in the backdrop of America's dismal human rights record, Garcetti was associated with the California Board of Human Rights Watch.\n\nBut on arrival in India as America's ambassador, Garcetti has spared no effort to ingratiate himself with officials, even meeting the Union Home Minister and offering help in the ethnic violence burning the border state of Manipur. What help did he have in mind, a Gaza type invasion?\n\nIn a recent development, the US House of Representatives has passed the 'Quad Bill' to facilitate closer cooperation between the Quad members - Australia, India, Japan and the US. The Bill officially calls to 'Strengthen US-Australia-India-Japan cooperation and directed the US State Department to submit a roadmap to increase engagements with Quad members.\n\nNotably, speaking at the Jaipur Literature Festival on February 4, 2024, Garcetti emphasised that India holds the leading role in the Quad, likening it to being in the \"driving seat,\" while the US occupies the seat next to it with the \"corrective steering wheel.\" He highlighted that it is India's responsibility to assertively delineate what we want to do with the Quad.\n\nGarcetti's message is implicitly clear - you be the forefront of Quad, we will tell you what to do and where to go? And, in the event of a clash with China, you fire, we will give you intelligence that suits us and of course we will supply you weapons at our price.\n\nSpeaking at the special session titled \"Strengthening Indo-U.S. Relationship in Amrit Kaal - Aatmanirbhar Bharat\" organised by the Indo-American Chamber of Commerce on January 30, 2024, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said that the capital and technological know-how from the US can help India achieve its goal of becoming a developed country by 2047, and India-US cooperation will act as force multiplier for \"rules-based world order\".\n\nHope the minister realises the trap being set up - how smoothly an India-China war can be triggered with India in the \"driver's seat\" and America sitting on the fence, Ukraine-style.\n\nConcurrently, there is news that the first spy satellite by a local private player (Tata Advanced Systems Limited - TASL) is being sent to Florida for launching aboard a SpaceX rocket by April 2024, which will be used by the Indian Armed Forces to get \"discreet information\". This should pose multiple questions. Is ISRO incapable of providing a rocket for this \"spy\" satellite?\n\nDoesn't using a foreign rocket violate the much vaunted Atmanirbhar concept? Have the basic security concerns been addressed? Or, is this simply to boost cooperation in order to promote the \"rules-based order\" as talked of by Rajnath Singh?",

        "title": "War on Gaza: Strategic aims of Israel? - Pakistan Observer",
        "text": "THE Israel Defence Forces (IDF) spokesperson has announced that the war on Gaza will continue until complete victory, a sentiment echoed by the Israeli Prime Minister. Throughout human history, there have been individuals who built their empires on human suffering. The Prime Minister of Israel appears intent on seeking strategic leverage in the Middle East by conquering Gaza and eliminating its population. The new offensive on Rafah is horrifying due to its disastrous dimensions. Under the pretext of hostages, Israel is prepared to kill and displace 1.5 million Palestinians. It's unfortunate that the world is not moving beyond lip service. However, when the tide turns, the victors are often made to pay for their atrocities, war crimes and genocidal actions. It's ironic that over the past couple of days, the US Administration has warned Benjamin Netanyahu against the Rafah offensive due to its horrific dimensions. It's further ironic that the US President is complaining that Mr. Netanyahu is not listening to the United States. The Foreign Office, EU and other nations are condemning Netanyahu's offensive policy, which amounts to nothing short of genocide, yet their efforts seem futile. There are voices of reason within the US itself, but they are not being heard.\n\nIt appears that Israel is determined and planning to establish illegal settlements in Gaza. The death toll in the Rafah area has increased significantly, resulting in massive casualties, sometimes exceeding 100 per day. The area is densely populated, with an estimated 1.5 million people residing there. Additionally, Israel has carried out a drone attack on Islamic Resistance, resulting in the death of three individuals. Consequently, Islamic Resistance has warned America that they will target military bases in Iraq and Jordan.\n\nOn the seas, Houthi attacks on commercial shipping have intensified despite US and UK airstrikes in Yemen. President Biden has announced they will give an appropriate response. At the same time, world pressure for a ceasefire is increasing. The Russian Foreign Minister has accused the United States of doing nothing and turning a blind eye to the atrocities being committed in Gaza. Mr. Sergey accused the United States of very irresponsible behaviour. Similarly, China has come out strongly against Israeli war crimes and is calling for a ceasefire. October 7, 2023, should not be used as an excuse to carry out genocide in Gaza. The International Court of Justice has also clearly branded Israeli actions as war crimes. Most recently, Israel has closed the Rafah crossing, resulting in the cessation of aid to the affected population of Gaza. By now, almost 29,000 people have died, and over a hundred thousand are injured. Ninety percent of hospital facilities are destroyed and 75% of the infrastructure is in ruins. It's time to end this madness. The deadline for the offensive on Rafah is March 10.\n\nSome US Senators are urging President. Biden to attack in response to the attacks of Islamic Resistance. Iran is warned that the implication of such an action will be horrendous and devastating for the region. It has blamed United States striking bases in Iraq. So far over 552 Israeli soldiers have been killed and 138 are still prisoners. Two hostages have now been rescued by the Israeli forces in Rafah area inflicting heavy casualties on the Palestinian unarmed civilians. Especially in the Nasser Hospital, it is non-functional now. It is as the Israeli strikes and unending heavy rains have also played havoc in the refugee camps all over Gaza. Medicines and food supply has virtually come to zero. UN Secretary General has warned of the impending disaster.\n\nMajor Powers, including Russia and China, urge the United States to recognize global sentiment as the war escalates, risking further regional entanglement. In an election year, President Biden faces pressure to support Israel despite growing calls for peace from the American public. Similar constraints apply to Trump's camp. Consequently, war crimes go unchecked, undermining global order and stability. The Middle East's evolving dynamics and threats to shipping lanes disrupt global supply chains, leading to increased insurance and freight rates, exacerbating inflation in Europe and America. Developing countries, already vulnerable, will suffer most from rising prices and oil disruptions.\n\nIsrael's grand strategic plan aims to occupy Gaza in various ways, including the completion of projects like a new canal from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, reportedly with US support. The strategic objectives include (a) occupying Gaza, (ii) expanding Israel's territory and (iii) gaining financial influence over Middle Eastern States. President Biden appears helpless as Netanyahu is not listening to anybody. Arab States, fearing Israel's financial and nuclear power, are reluctant to intervene. Israeli offensive actions are becoming more severe, particularly in the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia, where Israeli investment in industry, trade and real estate is increasing. The UAE is granting residential status to a large number of Israelis. With increasing hold on the trade and industry, it is feared that in the next 20/30 years, UAE will become another Gaza, or they will compromise their sovereignty. The impact of Middle East's changed scenario is going to be felt in South Asia as well as most of the labour and manpower comes from India, Pakistan Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. This will affect the jobs and trade of South Asian people. Similarly Gulf States investment in South Asia, especially Pakistan, where Indian ingress is increasing.\n\nThe conclusion, Israel will not stop its offensive planned in Rafah area and thus cause immense destruction both in human lives and infrastructure. As the Russian, Australian and other number of Foreign Ministers have warned the world it must not close its eyes. It is obvious and clear that the force can be stopped with force. Israelis will only learn a lesson when they are answered in the same coin. Further, Hamas role is also dubious?\n\n-- The writer is a senior researcher and analyst.

The UK has imposed sanctions on six managers of the prison colony where Navalny died.\n\nThe inclusion of Chinese and Indian companies comes as the EU and its G7 partners attempt to crack down on Russia's use of third countries and transit routes to evade existing curbs designed to hamper its war economy.\n\nBrussels had abandoned plans to sanction mainland Chinese companies under pressure from member states including Germany that were fearful of antagonising Beijing.\n\nBut Russia's continued ability to produce large numbers of drones, missiles, tanks and other weapons despite extensive western trade bans has put pressure on G7 capitals to step up their anti-evasion efforts.\n\nThe measures will target three companies in mainland China and one in India, alongside businesses in Sri Lanka, Turkey, Thailand, Serbia and Kazakhstan, according to documents seen by the Financial Times.\n\nThe targeted businesses will be hit by trade restrictions after being identified as helping to supply equipment, particularly electronics and microchips, used by Russia to manufacture weapons or other equipment used in its war against Ukraine . \"It is also appropriate to include on that list certain other entities in third countries that indirectly support Russia's military and industrial complex\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009by trading in such components,\" the sanctions proposal said.\n\nThe agreement by EU ambassadors on Wednesday will allow the measures to be formally approved ahead of the second anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion on February 24.

The EU has lifted sanctions against a small number of Russian businessmen and their relatives following legal challenges, though none had spoken out against the war.\n\nVolozh, who moved to Israel after Putin annexed the Crimean peninsula in 2014 and has not visited Russia since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, was placed under sanctions in 2022 for what the EU described as Yandex's complicity in the war, prompting him to resign as chief executive and transfer voting rights from his controlling stake to the board.\n\n\"Evidence against him was deemed weak, hence the delisting,\" said a person briefed on the matter. The European External Action Service did not respond to a request for comment. Volozh did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe lifting of sanctions would allow Volozh to help grow a group of internationally focused tech start-ups that are staffed by about 1,300 Russians who left the country after the outbreak of war. Yandex's Nasdaq-listed parent company agreed to spin off the companies as part of a deal to sell its Russian operations.",

        "title": "Sneaky ancient military tactic among special attractions at this weekend's Royal Canberra Show | Riotact",
        "text": "Charge! Photo: Australian Tentpegging Association, Facebook.\n\nIn the centuries before Christ, if you wanted to take an enemy camp by night, there was one surefire way to create havoc.\n\nThe Australian Tentpegging Association (ATA) describes the tactic as a \"military exercise whereby a group of mounted soldiers would ride through an enemy camp in a pre-dawn raid, removing the pegs which held the tents in place with the tips of their sharp spears\".\n\n\"Foot soldiers could then attack the enemy as they struggled to get out from under the collapsed tents.\"\n\nAt least that was the theory behind 'tent pegging', even if historians aren't entirely sure how often it actually happened in real-life battles. Or whether it originated in Arabia, Central Asia, or India. Or if similar tactics were deployed against war elephants.\n\nOver the centuries, it morphed into a calvary training exercise. For example, the Australian Light Horse Brigade practised the moves during World War I. From 1964, however, it became an official sport in Australia - the first local civilian tentpegging team was based in Deniliquin, NSW.\n\nCloser to home, it's been among the list of special attractions for the past three Royal Canberra Shows - following a decade-long absence - and it's back again this weekend when three Australian teams will show off their precise horseback skills.\n\nThe aim of the game is to pick up the wooden tent pegs with either a lance or a sword. Photo: Australian Tentpegging Association, Facebook.\n\nLong-time tentpegger Merv Membrey will be judging for speed, control of the horses and how well the competitors pull up the tent pegs.\n\nThe horses will set off at a gallop across the main arena at Exhibition Park at speeds between 35 and 40 km/h while their riders use a sword or a lance to pierce, pick up and carry away a small wooden tent peg from the ground.\n\n\"It's not a raggedy game,\" Merv says. \"It hails from the military, so it involves very precise movements.\"\n\nThe horses vary from ex-racers to Clydesdales. Photo: Australian Tentpegging Association, Facebook.\n\nMerv lives in Wakool, a seven-hour drive away in the western Murray region of NSW, and picked up the sport as a 32-year-old.\n\n\"I rode horses as a kid, but over a can of rum, when an old mate of mine asked me if I'd like to have a go, I decided to give tentpegging a go.\"\n\nMerv has since been privileged to represent Australia on the international stage three times over the years, starting in 1996 at the World Tentpegging Championship in South Africa.\n\nThere are teams in nearly every state and territory in Australia, and the International Tent Pegging Federation has 45 member countries, including South Africa, Namibia, India, Pakistan, Israel, Great Britain, the Netherlands, the US, Canada and New Zealand.\n\n\"It's massive in South Africa,\" Merv says.\n\n\"They make us look like outsiders. We in Australia don't have many members, unfortunately, due to the costs and - to be right up front - politics have really done us some harm.\"\n\nAs for the horses, some are ex-racers, but plenty of others are stock horses. Even Clydesdales, as it turns out.\n\n\"There's one rider who will be there at the weekend on a Clydesdale-Quarter cross and it is a beautiful horse.\"\n\nThe Royal Canberra Show's games will be attended by three teams in total: two from northern Victoria and a light-horse team from Tamworth.\n\nThe Tamworth team will be among the three competing in Canberra this weekend. Photo: Australian Tentpegging Association, Facebook.\n\n\"I love the sport,\" Merv says. \"I took it on as a challenge, but to have the privilege to be in the first Australian team in an international competition and hold the flag in another country - I tell you what - I know how those Olympians feel. It really shakes you up.\"\n\nThe Royal Canberra Show will be held at Exhibition Park in Canberra (EPIC) from Friday, 23 February, to Sunday, 25 February.\n\nOther major attractions include the BMX bike stunt show Airtime, Showmow lawnmower racing, the Grand Parade, woodchopping, the How Saw chainsaw shootout, and fireworks displays from 9 pm on Friday and Saturday nights.\n\nBuy tickets online ($13.27 to $68.37).",

        "title": "Biden's Early Errors on Iran Are Handcuffing Washington in Middle East and Beyond",
        "text": "Under the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, a total ban on Tehran's exports of missiles and drones expired in November. Last fall's failure to strike down the UN writ legalized Iranian arms deals with Russia, making it difficult for America to push back.\n\nPresident Biden's early mistakes regarding Iran policy are increasingly haunting Washington, and America is now struggling to put out fires in the Mideast and beyond as it plays catch up.\n\nDespite several American strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen and a reported cyber hit on the Iranian spy ship Behshad, and even as Europeans are planning to send a maritime strike force to the region, attacks on Red Sea commercial shipping are escalating.\n\nBeyond the slowdown in world commerce that results from these attacks, Iran's growing arms trade with Russia is complicating America's efforts to help Ukraine. The Islamic Republic is also tightening relations with Communist China, its largest oil buyer since enforcement of Iran export sanctions has lessened considerably.\n\nAn American drone was downed by the Houthis this week. Two anti-ship missiles were launched Tuesday night at the Sea Champion, an American-owned carrier delivering humanitarian aid to Yemen. The crew of the British-registered Rubymar was forced to abandon ship after it was hit Sunday. The extent of damage to the vessel is unknown, and it might have sunk.\n\nThe Iranian-backed Houthis seem undeterred by a spate of American military activity that followed last month's attack on a U.S. post in Jordan, where three American troops were killed. The Yemeni terrorists, who claim to aid Gaza, are all but blocking ship movement in the Red Sea, through which 15 percent of world commerce passes. Ironically, the economies of India, Egypt, and Europe are being hit harder than Israel's.\n\nOn Friday, the Department of State restored President Trump's listing of the Houthis as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group, after Mr. Biden, in one of his first acts as president, had removed the Iran-backed group from the terrorist list. Rather than devising a coherent policy on the Houthis, \"we're just back to 2021,\" an Iran watcher at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, Behnam Ben Taleblu, says.\n\nAmerica is attempting to achieve deterrence that was lost by early attempts to lure the Islamic Republic back to the 2015 nuclear deal that was abandoned by Mr. Trump in 2018. In the process, Mr. Biden declared a regional foe of Iran, Saudi Arabia, a \"pariah,\" and criticized its war, alongside the United Arab Emirates, against the Houthis.\n\nIran has armed the Houthis -- whose slogan is \"death to America, death to Israel, curse the Jews, long live Islam\" -- to the teeth. Now America and several partners are trying to deter the Yemeni group and its Tehran patrons from further disrupting Red Sea commerce.\n\nAmerica's attacks on Houthi targets and its redesignation as a terror group are welcome, \"but we didn't lose deterrence overnight in the Middle East, and we are not going to regain it overnight,\" Mr. Ben Taleblu tells the Sun. \"Why didn't the administration react more forcefully early-on to the Houthi threat, and what did waiting achieve?\"\n\nIn the Mideast, Iran's war through proxies consists of an anti-Israel \"ring of fire\" and an \"axis of resistance\" that acts against other regional enemies. Yet, allowed for decades to beef up its arms industry, the mullahs have now emerged as a top Russian partner, exporting and developing missiles and drones that help the assault on Ukraine, and may well show up elsewhere in Europe.\n\nIran has provided Russia with some 400 surface-to-surface missiles, Reuters reported Wednesday, based on Iranians sources. Those include the Fateh-110 family of short-range ballistic weapons, such as the Zolfaghar, which is capable of striking targets up to 435 miles away. Some of these missiles are shipped through the Caspian Sea, while others are sent via air.\n\nAdditionally, since the start of the Ukraine war Russia has purchased at least 6,000 Shahed-136 drones, and received extensive aid in setting up local production lines for the drones, Haaretz reported on Wednesday, based on a trove of leaked documents and emails from an Iranian defense industry firm. Moscow is partially paying for these deals with several tons of gold ingots.\n\nLast year Washington failed to trigger the \"snapback\" option of a United Nations Security Council resolution that legalized the 2015 nuclear deal. According to that deal, a total ban on Iran's exports of missiles and drones expired in November. Last fall's failure to strike down the UN writ legalized Iranian arms deals with Russia, making it difficult for America to push back.\n\nThe failure to revive a UN arms embargo long after the futility of Washington's Iran overtures were obvious to all is emblematic of how American global deterrence was lost. Mr. Biden's early, idealistic misconceptions about the power of diplomacy are likely to undermine America's interests long after they are replaced with more reality-based policies.",

        "title": "India and the Red Sea Imbroglio",
        "text": "India, with its traditionally close ties with Iran and its increasing influence in the region, may have a role to play in alleviating the present crisis.\n\nIn August 2022, given that there had been no incident of attacks on merchant shipping off the coast of Somalia since 2018, industries representing various sectors such as shipping, cargo, tanker, and insurance conveyed their position to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) concerning the removal of the Indian Ocean High Risk Area, effective January 1, 2023.\n\nIt did not take too long for the Houthis in Yemen to upend the decision. They started attacking merchant ships in the Red Sea, a global maritime trade route that connects the Indian Ocean with the Mediterranean Sea, and further to Europe, as retaliation against Israel's attack on Gaza following Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. These attacks have led to soaring oil prices, increased insurance costs, and detours of mercantile marine traffic resulting in a cascading effect on costs and the global economy.\n\nThis also puts the United States in a peculiar position, as its attacks on the Houthis in the region have had a negligible effect. The Houthis are aided and abetted by Iran, but the United States does not want to get into a direct conflict or confrontation with Iran, as this might lead to a wider conflict in the region beyond the ongoing Israel-Hamas war that continues to smolder without any end in sight. In this context, it is important to understand the relevance of Iran's support to the Houthis and the implications of continued strife affecting global shipping and trade.\n\nIndia, with its traditionally close ties with Iran and its increasing influence in the region, may have a role to play in alleviating this crisis.\n\nIran's continued support to Houthis as it attacks ships in the Red Sea could well be another attempt to continue the escalatory spiral between the West and Iran. This needs to be understood against the backdrop of transition day (when the U.N. sanctions of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal lapsed) and the quick imposition of new sanctions by Western countries, mainly led by the United States, in an attempt to target Iran's ballistic missile and drone programs.\n\nThe utilization of Iranian drones, particularly by proxies, is a low-cost option that affords plausible deniability with strategic ramifications in the region. Especially with the conflict that rages between all-weather U.S. ally Israel and the Palestinians in the Gaza strip, this is an opportune moment for Iran, with the United States wary of getting into a direct conflict in an election year. The message for the United States is loud and clear: The more it attempts to corner Iran internationally, first by scuttling the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and then by imposing additional sanctions on Iran's energy, financial, economic, and defense sectors, the higher Tehran will bounce back through its proxies in the region. This would ultimately help Iran further achieve its objective of widening the wedge between itself and Israel, and the larger Arab world.\n\nChina, for its part, smells an opportunity to be a security provider in the region given its close ties with Iran and its reluctance to condemn the Houthi attacks. China does not want to be a part of Operation Prosperity Guardian, the U.S.-led effort to defend shipping in the Red Sea region. Beijing, which has conveyed its support for the Palestinian cause, is more than happy to witness decreasing U.S. influence in the region while projecting itself as a power that needs to be reckoned with. It also does not want to be seen as being aligned with the United States, as would occur if it were to join the U.S.-led coalition to protect shipping in the region. Discrediting the United States, Beijing might want to pursue a more active role in diffusing the Israel-Hamas conflict by acting as an interlocutor with the Arab world, and this would indirectly reduce Houthi attacks on Red Sea shipping.\n\nThere is no denying the fact that India is a resident player that occupies nearly 40 percent of the strategic waters of the Indian Ocean. At the same, it is also true that New Delhi, on its own, lacks the capability and capacity to deal with any crises where the lines between state and non-state actors have blurred and shades of grey have emerged.\n\nTimes have changed, as today India continues to buy energy from Russia despite sanctions, while it stopped importing crude from Iran following the JCPOA when sanctions were imposed on Iran's energy and financial sectors. India, with its geopolitical influence and strategic location in the Indian Ocean Region, and possessing a large navy that has exercised with most countries within the region and beyond, can emerge as a major player to become a net security provider.\n\nThe 12th edition of the biennial multinational exercise, MILAN 2024, currently taking place from February 19-27 in Visakhapatnam, will see the navies of 50 countries, including Iran, participating. With its theme of \"Camaraderie, Cohesion, Collaboration\" the Indian Navy, with its partners, aims to work together, collaborate, and respond cohesively as a united and credible force in the region. These exercises help forge bonds with professional interactions as well as cultural, sports, and other activities during the harbor phase. That will go a long way in increasing the synergy between the participating navies toward large force multilateral operations at sea that can act as a deterrent to inimical forces like the Houthis.\n\nApart from the immediate economic fallout and consequential inflation for some parts of the world, the possible long-term implications of the Red Sea crisis may lead to a deteriorating security situation in the region. The need of the hour today is for like-minded countries to unite, collaborate, and operate in unison to ensure freedom of navigation on the high seas that does not adversely affect maritime trade and security in the region.",

World War II was the deadliest military conflict in human history, with an estimated 70-85 million people perishing from the war directly or through war-caused disease, famine, and other indirect factors.\n\nMost of the dead were civilians. In addition, many millions of people were wounded -- blinded, crippled, driven mad, or otherwise ravaged by the vast carnage. Large portions of the globe had become a charnel house, with the battered survivors left to desperately scavenge for food amid the burnt-out rubble and ruin.\n\nAlthough some scholars have pointed out that warfare has declined since then, and especially since the end of the Cold War, there was a sharp turnabout in 2022, when the wars in Ethiopia and Ukraine contributed to more battle-related deaths than in any year since 1994. By late 2023, Russia's military invasion of Ukraine alone had produced an estimated 315,000 killed or injured Russian troops, while the number of casualties among Ukrainian troops and civilians, though unknown, is certainly enormous.\n\nAmong these and the many other wars currently raging -- in Sudan, Myanmar, Ethiopia, the Sahel, and Syria, to name only a few -- the recent one in Gaza, with the fastest daily death rate of the 21 century, is particularly alarming, having already led to nearly 30,000 deaths and nearly 70,000 injuries.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's nuclear war, which emerged in 1945 with the utter annihilation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and which now has the capacity to end virtually all life on earth. Amid public threats from leaders of nuclear-armed nations to launch a nuclear war, the editors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists have set their \"Doomsday Clock\" at its closest ever to apocalypse.\n\nWar -- particularly nuclear war -- is probably the fastest way to extinguish the human race, but there are other crises underway that, on a longer-range basis, seem likely to accomplish the same task.\n\nThe most serious of these crises is environmental. In recent decades, there has been a rapid loss of biodiversity, with the sixth mass extinction of wildlife clearly accelerating.\n\nPollution has grown dramatically. This includes pollution of land and water caused by chemicals and by plastic (which takes 400 years to decompose) and of the air caused by industrial, motor vehicle, and other emissions (leading to an estimated 4.2 to 7 million human deaths annually).\n\nDamage to the soil, caused especially by use of toxic chemicals and other pollutants, as well as by deforestation, has become particularly severe. The United Nations has estimated that some 40 percent of the planet's soil is now degraded.\n\nA key element in the environmental collapse is the growing climate catastrophe, caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels. Melting icecaps and rising sea levels, unprecedented hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, and ocean acidification are all well underway.\n\nTogether with unsustainable farming practices, rising temperatures have produced growing food and water scarcity. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres declared that, unless immediate action is taken, there will be a \"global food emergency that could have long term impacts on hundreds of millions of adults and children.\"\n\nFurthermore, it is estimated that, by 2025, two-thirds of the world's people might face water shortages. Commenting on the deteriorating climate situation, Guterres declared gloomily in September 2023 that \"humanity has opened the gates to hell.\"\n\nThe rise of rightwing nationalism provides yet another challenge to human survival. In recent years, rightwing political movements -- headed by authoritarian demagogues such as Donald Trump (United States), Jair Bolsonaro (Brazil), Vladimir Putin (Russia), Narendra Modi (India), Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkey), Marine Le Pen (France), Benjamin Netanyahu (Israel), Viktor Orban (Hungary), and their counterparts in other lands -- have transformed the landscape of world politics.\n\nAppealing to xenophobia, militarism, racism, and religious prejudice, they have made great strides toward stirring up longstanding hatreds in their ruthless quest for power. A key to their success along these lines has been their call to revive the ostensible glory of their own nations by purging their internal enemies and triumphing over other, ostensibly inferior, countries abroad. Redolent of the fascist movements of the 1930s, this Radical Right approach portends worldwide turmoil, violence, and destruction.\n\nOf course, it might not be too late to head off these developments. After all, in the twentieth century, humanity did manage to defeat the drive of the rightwing maniacs who established fascist regimes and launched vast wars to rule the world.\n\nIn the aftermath of the chaos and destruction of World War II, humanity did manage to create the United Nations and to extend the range of international law. And, still later, as the planet stood on the brink of nuclear war, humanity did manage to roll back the nuclear menace and, for a time, halt the nuclear arms race and curb the prevalence of war.\n\nMoreover, there are a great many efforts underway -- by social movements and some far-sighted governments -- to address the contemporary crises. Peace, environmental, and political action movements have flourished and brought forth demands for sweeping changes in public policy. In addition, some social movements, recognizing the global nature of the problems facing humanity, have called for enhanced global governance to cope with the severe threats posed by war, environmental devastation, and violations of human rights.\n\nEven so, as the world once again veers toward destruction, it's clear that it's getting late -- very late -- to avert catastrophe.",

        "title": "Red Sea Crisis to Impact India's Capital Goods and Fertiliser Sectors: CRISIL",
        "text": "New Delhi: The ongoing Red Sea crisis is going to impact India's capital goods and fertiliser sectors the most, according to a CRISIL report released on Wednesday. It will have a medium impact on pharma, crude oil, and shipping sectors, the rating agency said.\n\nHouthi rebels in Yemen are attacking cargo ships plying the waters connecting Asia with Europe and the United States in a bid to stop Israel's offensive against Hamas in Gaza. As a result, traffic is being forced away from the Suez Canal and redirected around the tip of Africa. The disruption is causing delays and driving up costs at a time when economies around the world are already grappling with concerns of resurgent inflationary trends. The extent to which escalating shipping costs will reflect in consumer prices is still unclear. This is especially in Europe, where weak consumer demand means businesses will face pressure to absorb extra shipping costs.\n\nThe CRISIL report said that a sustained disruption in trade routes, particularly one causing delays in the timely delivery of goods, holds the potential to significantly impact players within the capital goods sector. The ripple effect of such disruptions extends to various facets of the industry, potentially leading to an undesirable inventory build-up. This accumulation can, in turn, exert pressure on the operational efficiency of engineering, procurement and construction companies operating in this sector. The intricacies of supply chain management become more pronounced as delayed deliveries may contribute to a slowdown in the crucial process of order conversions along with shooting up of logistics costs. Consequently, the sector could grapple with the dual challenges of managing excess inventory and a deceleration in the conversion of prospective orders, impacting the overall business dynamics and performance of these enterprises.\n\nThe Red Sea conflict has impacted Middle East's fertiliser exports to India. As per reports, the crisis has extended shipment timelines by nearly 15 days and hiked freight costs. Import of the key fertiliser, muriate of potash (MOP), from Jordan and Israel has been majorly affected. Israel constitutes 10-15% of MOP exports to India, while Jordan constitutes 25-30%. Though the Indian government has assured a sufficient buffer for fertilisers, MOP supplies from these countries will be affected if the situation persists for long.\n\nSome 50% of the Indian pharma industry's revenue comes from export markets, with the US and Europe contributing majorly. While the US and Europe contributed 50% of the overall formulation exports, Europe alone contributed one-third of the overall bulk drug exports between April and November 2023.\n\nOut of the overall exports, almost two-thirds of pharma exports are by sea; with the Red Sea being the shortest route connecting Asia with Europe and North America, there could be some turbulence if the situation persists in the long run. This may result in increased shipping surcharges and freight costs, which will eventually impact the margins of industry players. The delay in product deliveries may lead to an additional financial burden on them. Having said that, so far, the impact of this event is not pronounced.\n\nOverall pharma exports grew by a healthy 12.5% on-year (rupee terms) between April and November 2023. This growth was supported by the drug shortages in these two geographies and other factors such as exporters planning well in advance for the long year-end vacations in the US and Europe. Hence, exports to these two key markets happened well in advance to gear up for the peak season. However, from a broader perspective, considering India's dependence on the US and Europe for pharma exports, the current crisis, if prolonged, may lead to deterioration of margins, increased shipping/freight charges, and an additional financial burden due to delay in product delivery over the longer term\n\nIndia's overall import of crude depends on Russia (37%), Iraq (21%), and Saudi Arabia (14%). While the supply has largely remained unaffected, the current escalation has resulted in elevated freight and insurance costs. Furthermore, crude prices have started inching upwards consequent to the escalated geopolitical tensions. This is likely to impact incremental spreads observed by the oil marketing companies in the domestic market. Tighter shipping markets would further impact exports; Europe accounted for 21% of India's overall petroleum product exports in fiscal 2023. Incremental shipping costs are likely to reduce overall spreads of petroleum product exports, impacting the profitability of standalone refiners.\n\nCRISIL said that shipping freight rates have spiked of late because of geopolitical issues in the Middle East and attacks on vessels sailing through the Red Sea. While container shipping freight rates globally are now 2.5-3.0 times higher than in early December 2023, spot rates for vessels transiting through the Suez Canal -- particularly from Asia to Europe -- have surged nearly five-fold. Also, rates from China to the US have more than doubled.\n\nThe increase in global spot rates is also because of a shortage of available vessels at ports owing to unscheduled rerouting around the Cape of Good Hope, which is causing delays of up to two weeks. While 80% of the shipping contracts are long-term, their renewals can be affected if the geopolitical tension in the Middle East persists. That said, the additional cost for the detour may not be significant for the vessel operator when compared to the increase in freight rates. The operator could benefit from not having to pay the Suez Canal toll. To summarise, the overall impact of the situation has been positive to neutral on the shipping industry given the fact that the elevated freight rates have more than compensated for the incremental operating costs and additional risk borne by the operators.",

        "title": "Navalny's Death Highlights a New Global Division on Political Violence",
        "text": "The unexplained death in prison of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is a symbol of global attempts to shift the balance of power toward authoritarian elites everywhere.\n\nFive years before the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the world was shocked by another political murder: the dismemberment of Saudi opposition journalist Jamal Khashoggi in his country's consulate in Istanbul. While Khashoggi was less famous than Navalny, his brutal killing caused a major chill in relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia, especially when an investigation indicated that the hit had been ordered by none other than Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler.\n\nWhen bin Salman attended a G20 summit a month after Khashoggi's murder, most world leaders refused to meet with him. He did share a jovial handshake with Russian President Vladimir Putin, however. It was clear the two dictators wanted to pose in front of the cameras to show the world how little they care about the opinion of Western countries.\n\nHalf a decade later, nothing has changed. Not a single leader from a non-Western country has condemned Navalny's death in a Russian prison. Instead, the issue of whether political murders -- and political violence in general -- is acceptable if it's carried out in the interests of protecting a nation's sovereignty is becoming a new global dividing line.\n\nThe locations of gatherings in memory of Navalny were very telling. There were dozens of vigils in European and North American cities, as well as in Israel, Argentina, and even South Korea. But police broke up a gathering in Istanbul, while in Dubai -- which has the biggest Russian diaspora in Asia -- nothing took place at all. This is explained both by the typical profile of Russians who have moved to Dubai (wealthy and often apolitical) and by the local political system, which prohibits protests and demonstrations.\n\nThe post-Soviet space was just as divided: there were large vigils for Navalny in Armenia and Georgia, but nothing in Central Asia. There are quite a lot of anti-war, opposition-minded Russian emigres in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, but local authorities would be unlikely to allow demonstrations. They are not only afraid of angering their northern neighbor, but are also inherently similar to the Kremlin dictatorship, despite their multi-vector foreign policies. While they may court Western investment, they have zero sympathy for the dead Russian opposition leader.\n\nThe division of the post-Soviet space into a broadly pro-European Armenia and Georgia and neutral Azerbaijan and Central Asia reflects a global trend in which countries either accept Western political values or demonstratively reject them. This division is only becoming more stark: after the recent war in the disputed South Caucasus region of Nagorno-Karabakh, for example, Armenia replaced its long-time ally Russia with ideologically closer Western allies, while authoritarian Azerbaijan has seen relations with Europe deteriorate -- a trend it explains by the need to defend itself against threats to its sovereignty.\n\nIncreasingly, the capacity of a state to commit sovereign political violence is becoming a marker of the fight against \"Western neocolonialism.\" A growing number of regimes seem to believe that a state is only really sovereign if it can kill undesirable citizens -- including on foreign soil. As far as Russia is concerned, it's enough to recall the recent unsuccessful attempt by its authorities to extradite the rock group Bi-2 from Thailand, the attempted assassination of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the UK in 2018; and the killings of former Chechen rebel commanders in Berlin and multiple Arab countries.\n\nA similar approach is even being taken by some democratic states that appear to be drifting toward \"nationally oriented policies.\" India's security services, for example, recently killed the leader of Sikh separatists in Canada. Just as with Khashoggi, this has caused a deterioration in relations between the two countries.\n\nIn this context, Navalny's death is more than a consequence of an increasingly repressive Russian regime. As the epitome of political violence, it will become a symbol of global attempts to shift the balance in favor of the increasingly powerful elites of authoritarian countries. These people do not just see human rights activists as an obstacle in the battle for personal power, but as allies of foreign enemies who are easier to destroy than their distant patrons.\n\nIndeed, authoritarian elites view the entire concept of human rights in approximately the same way they do \"gender neutral toilets\" (an oft-repeated bugbear of Putin's): i.e., as an alien value that is promoted by Western propaganda and designed to exert a pernicious influence over people's minds. In a telling moment, the governor of Russia's western exclave of Kaliningrad recently criticized its most famous son -- the Enlightenment-era German philosopher Immanuel Kant -- as the ideological foundation of the current \"Western aggression\" against Russia.\n\nOf course, that is precisely the narrative peddled by Russian propaganda. But it's also how pro-Western opposition groups, human rights activists, and recipients of international grants are seen in Turkey, Hong Kong, and a growing number of Asian countries, including some former Soviet nations. If Navalny's supporters had gathered for a protest in Uzbekistan's capital Tashkent, Hong Kong, or Dubai, they would have been detained -- not so much out of solidarity with the Kremlin as for ideological reasons.\n\nOne of the main impediments to states seeking to reclaim their national sovereignty and throw off the fetters of neocolonial globalism is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that was adopted by the United Nations in 1948. The Russian regime is not only seeking to ignore this document, or indeed assert that it is secondary to Russian law. Instead, the Kremlin wants to trump it using Russian mob rules. It's mob rules -- not laws -- that explain the deaths of Navalny and the mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who died in a mysterious plane crash after his failed 2023 insurrection.\n\nA good analogy is Sharia law in Islamic countries where religious rules are considered to outweigh civil law. These ideas are a potent antithesis to Western influence: what is being rejected is not only international treaties, but the very principles of the rule of law.",

        "title": "Another big trouble for war-torn Palestinians, danger of starvation in Northern Gaza - India TV Hindi - hindustannewshub.com",
        "text": "Rafah (Gaza Strip): A great calamity has befallen the war-torn Palestinians. In fact, suddenly the food supply to northern Gaza has been stopped. Due to this, the Palestinians living in these areas are now at risk of dying of hunger. Palestinian citizens are troubled by this. The World Food Program (WFP) said on Tuesday it had halted food supplies to northern Gaza amid growing chaos across the region due to the Israel-Palestine war, raising the risk of starvation. A study conducted by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) warns that one in six children in northern Gaza is severely malnourished.\n\nTruck penetration has halved in the past two weeks due to the escalating war, according to UN data. UN officials and relief workers said Israel's failure to ensure the safety of trucks amid bombings and ground attacks has disrupted the arrival of trucks and the distribution of food. He said that Palestinians, who are facing starvation due to lack of security, often attack these trucks loaded with food. There is a danger of deepening the crisis in the area due to the interruption of the aid operation.\n\nOver the past two days, several airstrikes have hit areas of northern Gaza that the Israeli military said it had largely liberated from Hamas a few weeks ago. At the same time, the army on Tuesday ordered the evacuation of two areas in the southern part of Gaza city. After the attack by Israeli soldiers in Gaza, a large part of the city has been reduced to debris. At the same time, many lakhs of Palestinians are still deprived of aid. They are facing famine-like conditions as they and their families are getting food only once a day. Food supplies were stopped for the first time since a truck was attacked three weeks ago. However, attempts were made to restart it this week but convoys of trucks faced firing on Sunday and Monday. (AP)\n\nIndia and Greece reach new heights of friendship, Pakistan upset...China surprised\n\nWhy did Hamas terrorists who inflicted pain on Israeli hostages suddenly start delivering medicines?

        "title": "Biden Keeps Losing Wars",
        "text": "I am old enough to remember when it was considered a disgrace to even countenance the idea American could lose a war. Under Joe Biden, losing a war is a regular occurrence.\n\nVlad Putin took a victory lap in our latest defeat, the Ukraine War, by ruthlessly killing one of his few living Russian opponents -- Alexei Navalny. Joe Biden promised there would be reprisals if Navalny died back in 2021, but of course, that was an empty threat. Instead, buoyed by cynical regimes from China to India to North Korea willing to break international sanctions, Putin's terror state keeps on humming.\n\nUkraine's year-long offensive ran out of steam in the fall, just as I predicted. The Biden administration got way behind on weapon deliveries to Ukraine. There was already a huge ammo problem this summer when funds were supposedly in place.\n\nAll Biden's people have now is the ridiculous supplemental military aid package. This has billions of dollars more in \"humanitarian aid for Palestine\" as the price for helping Israel. No actions to secure our own borders, and just enough money to keep Ukraine fighting, but not defeating Russia, for another year. Long-requested weapons that once might have made a difference, from F-16 jets to ATACMS missiles, are still nowhere to be found.\n\nIn other words, our strategy is to fight another \"no-win war,\" much as the Democrats ran the Korean and Vietnam wars of the 20 century, or later, the Afghanistan War.\n\nBack in 2019, Donald Trump was impeached for wanting answers from Ukraine's new president about the corrupt payoffs to Joe Biden's family and briefly held up lethal military aid, to further this effort.\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky tried to play it both ways; saying he had no problem with Trump, who unlike his predecessor Obama, was sending him massive amounts of weaponry to defend his country. But otherwise, not engaging on the issue.\n\nIn 2020, when the whole Hunter Biden laptop scandal broke, showing the scale of the Biden crime family's foreign payday racket, Zelensky was conspicuously silent.\n\nHad he stepped up back then and started talking about how Biden blackmailed Ukraine to fire Viktor Shokin, the highly-regarded man investigating Burisma, it would have destroyed Old Joe's presidential run.\n\nInstead, he kept his mouth shut while Biden was elected, leaving Biden to resume Obama's policy of delaying weapons shipments, encouraging Putin to think he could invade Ukraine with impunity, especially after Biden's insane comments about a minor incursion.\n\nThat didn't work out so well for any of them. Zelensky lost big chunks of his country; Putin's incompetent soldiers were shot to pieces, once U.S. aid belatedly arrived; and Biden had yet another fiasco to go with his growing collection.\n\nRecently, Speaker Mike Johnson took my advice on further military appropriations -- trade Ukraine money for real border security. This was absolutely the right strategy. Biden and his people have complete contempt for our country and cannot be allowed to simply wave along tens of millions of foreign freeloaders into our nation, as part of their Make America Lousy Again policy.\n\nTheir bluff called, though, it looks like keeping the border open is all Democrats really care about. They won't compromise on that, even for their no-win war in Ukraine.\n\nThe Europeans, who could easily fund Ukraine if they wanted, are not coming through either. The lefties all cheered when Poland's Law and Justice party was defeated last year. But it still hasn't dawned on any of them that the conservative Poles were the best European allies Ukraine has. Under the current European alignment, Ukraine will now get plenty of lip service, but very little military support.\n\nOne hopes that sensible D.C. Republicans, if there are any left, are explaining to Zelensky, as distasteful as this is, that it's time to make a deal with Putin. Not a long-term one, nor one that recognizes border changes. Just some kind of cease-fire in place. Ordinary Ukrainians have fought and suffered enough. They don't have the manpower nor weapons to keep going. Putin is ruthlessly using human-wave attacks of his conscripts to gain ground. This human cannon fodder is not unlimited, but when alternated with Putin's regular army attacks, it can wear down the Ukraine lines, such as was done at Avdiivka.\n\nWhat worries me most now is not the lost war in Ukraine, nor a possible Putin move against NATO. His army is an empty shell; losses in men and equipment are staggering. His economy is a joke, as anyone who can do so is leaving, in an enormous brain drain. Nikki Haley can relax -- Russia has launched its last war of aggression for decades to come.\n\nWhat ought to concern everyone is the next war Old Joe is in the process of confecting and then losing, in the Middle East. Joe, along with Tony Blinken and company, think the best policy there is to keep appeasing Iran. Part of this is due to all the Iranian spies working for the administration. But most of it is due to the fact that these are the stupidest people to ever hold power in our national government. Just last month they made a show of reversing the terrorist designation for the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, but not to worry, U.S. taxpayer aid to Yemen keeps flowing through NGOs. The same switcheroo Hamas has pulled for years in Gaza.\n\nIran, through its missile shipments to Russia, has made Putin its junior partner in terror. Biden ended Trump's sanctions on Iran immediately after taking office and predictably, work on nuclear weapons has resumed in earnest. If serious sanctions cannot be imposed quickly or some kind of limited strike is not made on Iran's nuclear facilities this year, then the next real shooting war between Iran on one side, and the Gulf States and Israel on the other, will go atomic.\n\nLet's pray Team Biden is not around for another four years to lose that war.",

        "title": "America's Allies Often Misbehave When They Know They're Needed",
        "text": "As its rivals increasingly conglomerate to exert pressure against it, the West is often forced to ignore the flaws of its allies. Those allies in geo-strategically crucial zones get away with a lot more mischief than they should. Hungary and Serbia, for example, have somehow avoided punishment by Europe for pro-Kremlin excesses. India and Turkey ride roughshod over the rule of law daily with impunity. But there's nowhere more pivotal than Iraq, given Iran's hegemonic projections, and the attacks by Tehran's proxies on US troops - as the Iraqi parliament has again been debating various ways to expel the US presence in the country.\n\nAll of which makes the Iraqi Kurdish zone, despite its small footprint, that much more critical in the tectonic power struggles of the region. The Iraqi Kurds played a vital role as allies against ISIS. Before that, they served as allies during the second Gulf War. The Kurdish Region of Iraq (KRI) is a largely mountainous landscape dominated by tribal politics since time immemorial - and fractured by harsh terrain into pockets of separate power. All this is important, so stay with me. Iran dominates the eastern area near its border. In the mountains south of Turkey resides the PKK, a Marxist guerrilla community aligned against the Turks. And in the center is the Kurdish state capital of Erbil. I spent a good deal of time roaming the zone during the Gulf Wars, not least in Erbil, then as now dominated by the Barzani clan, who ran it as a fiefdom.\n\nThey still do, except now they do it via their political party the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) through updated institutional mechanisms like a parliament and presidency. Masoud Barzani, the patriarch, became first ever President from 2005 to 2017. His nephew now serves in that role. Officially, and somewhat nominally, those institutions govern the entire Kurdish zone - nominally because of the de facto distinct power zones cited above. And here's the rub. Turkey, Israel, and the West need the Barzani clan because it keeps the other Kurdish factions contained, especially the Iran-oriented areas, and it holds back the resurgence of ISIS. The Barzanis certainly don't want their power challenged. But sometimes there's a fresh little eruption of ISIS, or the terror group PKK infiltrates Turkey, or the Iran-backed Kurds make noises. Always, the Barzanis get renewed support from various Western allies. They expect it.\n\nSo that's the scene. Trouble is, the populace is restless, the provinces fractious, and the tribes growing - all equally expect patronage to flow their way in return for the Barzanis keeping their grip on power. We've seen this kind of phenomenon occur in the wider MENA region, the problems that come with tribal rule: corruption thrives, patronage replaces democracy and of the rule of law falters.\n\nFor a brief itemization of examples of these in the KRI, please see the notes at bottom.\n\nGenerally, patriarchal traditions dictate that chiefs propagate huge families and tribal numbers explode. Feeding them, keeping rivals placated and allaying family in- fighting become a full-time preoccupation. Other aspects of governance suffer - the rule of law, education, health care, employment, human rights - you get the picture. Here is a rather authoritative little glimpse into the Barzani-zone from the American Enterprise Institute that talks about the Kurdish media being \"strictly controlled\" and adding that the affairs of the clan can't be touched in print. It also says that Masoud Barzani has \"enriched himself and his family at the expense of the people\" and that, \"Corruption rivals that in Somalia, South Sudan, and Yemen.\"\n\nMoney-laundering, illicit oil from Iran, and other such shenanigans proliferate. Don't forget that during the time of the Islamic State, oil from there - ISIS oil - wound its way out via the Kurdish area to Turkey - even though the Kurds were busy fighting ISIS alongside the allies. So, we're talking that kind of Alice in Wonderland political landscape. Funds of all colors are always desperately needed. And so foreign investment becomes a priority. Recently, the Barzanis have unleashed a dog-and-pony show titled Invest Kurdistan to attract such funds. They rented a vastly expensive venue at Davos to bang the drum and rattle the tin - their dubious message being that their backyard could become another kind of UAE or Kuwait, as if the KRI is just a few billion away from sprouting skyscrapers, hotels and gin palaces for doing business or simply partying. After all, like the Gulf States, KRI also has oil and gas.\n\nSadly, there are several flaws in this picture. Firstly, the fossil fuel revenues keep grinding to a halt due to disputes involving Turkey, Baghdad and sundry oil producers in the region. Then there's the question of stability: the threat of ISIS plus malign Turkish and Iranian interest in the outer provinces would surely deter even the boldest of investors. Yet it could be argued that with security underwritten by the US and Europe, given a chance, neighbouring countries might allow a kind of neutral Swiss vibe to flourish where their silent money can go to hide and multiply. It's risky on the face of it. But with tacit American benevolence in the background, foreign emerging market types might be lured with guarantees from the Erbil government.\n\nBut according to the reports cited in the links, this scenario faces the ultimate fatal flaws: corruption, opacity and inadequate accountability. As the Barzanis travel around the West with their PR circus they don't mention the commercial partners who have lost money in Kurdistan. We're not talking minor oversights. We're talking massive legal disputes and one arbitral award in particular running into the billions. And the international community is starting to pay attention - in the last few days, I can exclusively report that a new website called Barzani Watch has launched which shines a spotlight on the clan's mischief.\n\nThe most high-profile example of foreign investors being shafted involves a joint venture headed by Sirwan Barzani - nephew of the former President of Kurdistan, Masoud Barzani, and cousin to the current President, Nechirvan Barzani. The doomed project saw French telecom giant Orange and Kuwaiti logistics firm Agility invest over $800 million into Korek Telecom, a Kurdish mobile operator headed by Sirwan Barzani, a former Peshmerga commander. After the joint venture imploded, The International Chamber of Commerce International Court of Arbitration (ICC) ruled in March 2023 that Korek Telecom and Sirwan Barzani had been part of a corrupt scheme to defraud the joint venture by bribing regulators at the Iraqi Communications and Media Commission, resulting in the joint venture losing its shareholding in Korek Telecom. Here is the full exhaustive legal document of the award. Here is a shorter summary with Korek's very brief response of 'disappointment' at the judgement and rejecting 'any allegations that it set out to decieve' etc.\n\nIn its final award, the ICC found that \"there was an unlawful means conspiracy pursuant to which [Sirwan Barzani] and his associates procured the CMC Decision with a view to using that decision to force the Claimant out of Korek\" As if this wasn't bad enough, the ICC tribunal also found Sirwan Birzani had defrauded the joint venture through self-dealing and sham loans, all of which breached the shareholders' agreement. Sirwan Barzani has not publicly acknowledged the ruling or the $1.65 billion award against him whilst the broader Barzani clan continues to portray Kurdistan as open for foreign investment, through its very glitzy Invest Kurdistan initiative. In today's straitened times, under these conditions, it's not clear how even the most venturesome non-state investor would consider sinking cash into this environment - with all the backstairs political intrigue, commercial mayhem and legal wrangling currently seen in Kurdistan.\n\n*Despite claiming to be a fully-fledged democracy, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) has held only five general elections in more than three decades. In 2017, the poll was postponed by one year due to the KRI's failed independence bid. In 2022, the parliament extended its term for a year before pushing the election back once more to February 2024 and now sometime between May 19-30th, 2024.\n\nHuman Rights Violations: The latest US State Department report on the state of human rights worldwide details how Iraq and the KRI continues to experience a decline in standards. For example, prisons in the KRI are 157% over capacity. Crime: The rate of violence and crime has increased due to intense factional rivalry among various Iraqi and Iranian-backed mafia-style groups. This crisis has had ripple effects on Iraqi Kurdish society and is one of the contributing factors to mass emigration and the 2021-22 migrant crisis on Belarus's border.\n\nSuppressed media freedoms: Suppression of media freedoms have spiked considerably in recent years. The Metro Center for Journalists' Rights and Advocacy published a report showing that 353 violations were committed against 260 journalists and media organisations in the KRI in 2021 alone.\n\nInstitutional corruption: Two of the Barzanis' California mansions have been connected to a conspiracy to defraud the Pentagon while supplying American military bases in Kurdistan, and the fuel contractor involved, DGC International, is said to have won its contracts through a secret contract with companies owned by Mansour Barzani. The Barzanis have reportedly facilitated the import of fuel from Iran across a KRG- controlled border crossing. Some of this fuel has been used to supply the U.S. military in a contravention of US sanctions, as companies commit to not buying Iranian fuel when taking on U.S. government contracts. Multiple articles claim that the source of Kurdistan's rich oil and gas industry is linked to Pentagon fuel purchases, especially Virginia-based logistics company, DGCI . As the links above to published articles show, for at least half a decade, DGCI has been the Pentagon's go-to fuel provider in Kurdistan and has been dogged by questions about its connections to Kurdish politicians. On one occasion, the DOD attempted to award fuel contracts to two other companies, but the Kurds prevented their deliveries, and the Pentagon ended up purchasing fuel from DGCI at even higher prices.",

        "text": "The Water Transport Workers Federation of India, which represents 3,500 workers has refused to handle all cargo ships transporting weapons to Israel. Image used for representational purposes/Reuters\n\nThe Israel-Hamas war continues to rage on; it's Day 137 and the casualties keep mounting with the Gaza Strip being reduced to dust owing to the widespread destruction. Country upon country has called for a ceasefire in the fighting, but Israel remains steadfast in its war against the Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\nAnd joining the call for a cessation of war and hostilities is an Indian trade union, representing employees at 11 major ports. The Water Transport Workers Federation of India has announced its decision to refuse to handle cargo shipments of weapons linked to Israel.\n\nWhat's going on? Why have these workers made such an announcement? Will it affect India-Israel ties?\n\n'Stand against the war'\n\nThe Water Transport Workers Federation of India (WTFI), which represents 3,500 workers and has representatives at 11 of the country's 12 major ports, has refused to handle all cargo ships transporting weapons to Israel. The union said it has decided not to handle military shipments for Israel at any port in the country.\n\nIt's important to note that the Water Transport Workers Federation of India is affiliated with the Centre for Indian Trade Unions, the labour wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).\n\nIts statement read: \"We, the Port workers, part of labour unions, would always stand against the war and killing of innocent people like women and children. The recent attack of Israel on Gaza plunges thousands of Palestinians into immense suffering and loss. Women and children have been blown to pieces in the war. Parents were unable to recognise their children killed in bombings which were exploding everywhere.\"\n\nThe statement further read, \"The Water Transport Workers Federation of India has decided to refuse to load or unload weaponised cargoes from Israel or any other country which could handle military equipment and its allied cargo for war in Palestine.\"\n\nThey also declared their solidarity with those who were campaigning for peace. \"We call upon the workers of the world and peace-loving people to stand with the demand of free Palestine.\"\n\nT Narendra Rao, general secretary of the Water Transport Federation of India (WTFI) later told The Wire, \"We not handle any weapon-laden cargo, which will go onto assist Israel to kill more women and children as we are seeing and reading every day in the news.\"\n\nHe was further quoted as telling Arab News that the working class organisation \"always opposes any war.\" \"Because if a war takes place, the main victims are the poor women and children. So we never want to have a war,\" he said.\n\n'Making a statement'\n\nThe stance taken by the WTFI has elicited reactions from many within the country. The All India Trade Union Congress, the oldest and second-largest trade union federation in India representing millions of workers, has also extended its support to the water transport workers.\n\nN Sai Bala Ji, an international relations expert and former student leader at Jawaharlal Nehru University, was also quoted by Arab News as saying, \"The whole world is turning a blind eye to what is happening in Gaza -- the mindless brutalities and genocide. The letter by the Water Transport Workers Federation of India gives us hope that the people are still fighting for justice and standing in solidarity with the hapless people.\"\n\nProfessor Apoorvanand Jha from Delhi University also echoed similar statements. Speaking to Arab News, he said: \"It is very heartening to see the workers of India joining the international working class in boycotting Israel and thus making a statement asking it stop the genocidal violence against Palestinians.\"\n\nIndia and Israel have been close partners, with Jerusalem being one of New Delhi's biggest and most dependable purchaser of weapons. Amid the ongoing war, New Delhi has maintained a balanced stance -- condemning the Hamas attack on 7 October last year, but calling for a ceasefire as well as calls for dialogue on a two-state solution between Israel and Palestine.\n\nOn the current stance, government sources have been quoted as saying that this will have no impact on the Indian ports. An official speaking to Business Standard explained that such supplies are made in containers, and most containerised cargo is shipped via ports running their terminals in public-private-partnership (PPP) mode.\n\nAdditionally, unions are not strong at these PPP terminals, as they're on the payroll of the private operator.\n\nOngoing Israel-Hamas war\n\nSince the assault began on 7 October 2023, Israel has launched a fierce assault in Gaza, vowing to wipe out Hamas. According to health ministry officials, more than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed so far.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, the United States, Israel's top ally, once again vetoed a draft United Nations Security Council resolution on the Israel-Hamas war, blocking a demand for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.\n\nUS Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield had signalled earlier that the Washington would veto the draft resolution over concerns it could jeopardise talks between the US, Egypt, Israel and Qatar that seek to broker a pause in the war and the release of hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"Any action this council takes right now should help, not hinder these sensitive, and ongoing negotiations. And we believe that the resolution on the table right now would, in fact, negatively impact those negotiations,\" Thomas-Greenfield told the council ahead of the vote.\n\nIn the meantime, the fighting has also taken a toll on Israel's economy . News agency AFP reported that the country's GDP had shrunk by almost one-fifth in the final quarter of 2023, compared to the three months prior. The country has also seen massive labour shortages and the collapse of the tourism industry since the outbreak of war.",

        "title": "Targeted assassinations now have a buffet of tech options -- flying Ginsu, drones, AI guns",
        "text": "Also Read: Ukraine has fired its military chief at the wrong time. Russia will exploit this instability\n\nThe Global War on Terror witnessed technologically advanced platforms and systems used for such operations. The 'flying Ginsu', or AGM-114R-9X, a CIA-developed variant of the Hellfire air-to-ground missile, became a weapon of choice in drone strikes against terrorist leaders. The Hellfire R9X was originally developed as an anti-tank missile, with variants featuring blast fragmentation and thermobaric warheads. However, to reduce collateral damage in counterterrorist operations, the explosive warhead was replaced with six stainless-steel blades that deploy just before impact with the target. The missile is extremely accurate with a lethal zone of 30 inches, serving the goal of minimising collateral damage.\n\nWith the development of newer technologies there has been a transformation in the conduct of such operations. For instance, a satellite-controlled machine gun with 'artificial intelligence' was reportedly used to assassinate Iran's leading nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, on 27 November 2020. Remarkably, the scientist's wife, who was sitting just 10 inches away in the same vehicle, was unharmed. The machine gun used in the operation was reportedly mounted on a Nissan pickup and was remotely operated using multiple cameras. Additionally, AI software was reportedly used to factor the relative speed of the two vehicles and the shaking of the truck when the bullets were fired. Thirteen bullets were fired when the vehicle carrying the scientist reached a U-turn, killing him and his guard. Israel, which has been blamed by Iran for the attack, has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement.\n\nIn the absence of any concrete evidence, this operation may seem to be in the realm of fantasy. However, rapid technological advancements may see a more frequent employment of such systems in the not-so-distant future.\n\nAlso Read: Gains from covert killing come with a big price tag. India can learn from Chile\n\nIsrael has unabashedly pursued a policy of neutralising 'terrorists' who have allegedly harmed its people or interest. The guiding principle of this approach was perhaps outlined in a July 1955 lecture by Moshe Dayan, then Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Titled 'Retaliation Operations as a Means of Ensuring Peace', the lecture to IDF officers sent a clear message: \"We cannot always prevent the murder of workers in an orchard or sleeping families, but we can set a high price for our blood. A price too high for the Arab settlement, the Arab army and the Arab government to pay. ... [Retaliation operations] are not for vengeance. It is an act of punishment and warning, that if that state does not control its population and does not prevent them attacking us - the Israeli forces will cause havoc in its land.\"\n\nWhat do countries hope to achieve from such operations? What are the objectives and the long-term consequences? Does the neutralisation of terrorist leaders lead to the demise of the organisation or even diminish their ability to conduct terrorist acts in the long run?\n\nThere are studies that suggest terrorist groups depend on the charisma of their leaders, making them seemingly irreplaceable. However, such studies may overemphasise the difficulties of leadership succession, as evidenced many times, including in the case of al-Qaeda. It has also been argued that the terrorist group is weakened when a leader with both operational and inspirational roles is eliminated. However, over time, terrorist groups have been observed to become functioning bureaucracies, with their own systems and processes, making them resilient to such attacks.\n\nSo, why do governments persist with such operations?\n\nAs Moshe Dayan said over six decades ago, a message needs to be sent -- either you control your people or we will be forced to do so, in the hope of reducing terrorist actions.",

        "title": "Cold War 2.0: The US-DragonBear standoff in a bifurcated global system",
        "text": "As the world navigates through Cold War 2.0, the interplay between the US and the DragonBear alliance will underpin much of the global and regional tensions and realignment\n\nIn the contemporary geopolitical landscape, debates are intensifying over the nature and trajectory of the global order. Some analogise the current situation to the precariousness of 1914, suggesting that the world is on the brink of a third World War. Others liken it to 1945, anticipating a new Cold War, primarily between the United States (US) and China. However, current tensions could be placed within the framework of Cold War 2.0, emblematic of a deepening rift between the US, on the one hand, and the DragonBear modus vivendi (China and Russia), on the other, amidst the bifurcation of the global system and the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR). Against this backdrop, Russia's military actions in Ukraine and the military conflict between Israel and Hamas are not isolated events but a manifestation of this Cold War 2.0. They reflect a broader geopolitical realignment, a division of the world that seems to deepen with each passing year. The year 2024 is poised to witness a new escalation in the Indo-Pacific region, where North Korea's actions and simmering tensions in the South China Sea and the Taiwan Strait, fuelled by China and Russia, will converge with the ongoing conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Russia's military actions in Ukraine and the military conflict between Israel and Hamas are not isolated events but a manifestation of this Cold War 2.0.\n\nIn the intricate embroidery of current global politics, the prospect of a direct military clash involving the US, China, and Russia is relatively low. This restraint stems not from a lack of capability or manifold conflictual interests but rather from a mutual understanding of the catastrophic consequences such a global conflict would entail. Instead, these major powers demonstrate a preference for strategic manoeuvring, engaging in a complex dance of diplomacy, geoeconomic pressures, and regional influence as we are currently observing in the crisis in the Red Sea, where the Iran-backed Houthi promised safe passage for Chinese and Russian ships. This approach allows them to advance their interests and assert their influence without crossing the threshold into open kinetic warfare. The strategic posturing, often playing out in proxy conflicts or through technological and geoeconomic competition over the access and control of critical resources and infrastructure, underscores a new era of geopolitical rivalry. It reflects a nuanced understanding that, in a world interconnected by global markets, digital industrial revolution, and shared ecological challenges, the costs of traditional warfare far outweigh the potential gains.\n\nIn the shadow of the looming Cold War 2.0, the spectre of nuclear weapons deployment, while present, remains an improbable outcome. The rationale behind this restraint is rooted in the mutual recognition of the devastating consequences of such actions, governed by the doctrine of mutually-assured destruction. However, this does not equate to nuclear complacency. On the contrary, the current geopolitical climate is likely to fuel an intensification in nuclear arms development and armament, signalling a resurgence of an arms race reminiscent of the mid-20th century but on a much bigger scale and scope. This trend will be marked by advanced technological innovations in nuclear weaponry, increased stockpiling, and the modernisation of arsenals. We might observe an emergence of new nations, like Iran, approaching the threshold of nuclear weapon acquisition. This escalation reflects a strategic posturing by major powers to bolster their deterrence capabilities and maintain a balance of power. Nevertheless, it also raises the stakes in global security, as the proliferation of nuclear weapons increases the risk of miscalculations and accidental engagements, thus adding a complex layer of tension to international relations.\n\nThe rationale behind this restraint is rooted in the mutual recognition of the devastating consequences of such actions, governed by the doctrine of mutually-assured destruction.\n\nThe contemporary global geoeconomic landscape is witnessing a continuous bifurcation, with trade, technology, and financial systems increasingly polarising along geopolitical lines. This trend, reflective of the broader tensions characterising the Cold War 2.0, is set to extend deeply into the realms of global finance this year. In response to this fragmented and fractured global order, notable shifts are anticipated from major economic blocs like the G20 and BRICS in 2024. These countries with the most vibrant economies are expected to actively explore and possibly implement alternatives to the US Dollar, which has long dominated international trade and finance. Such moves will signify a substantial reconfiguration of the global financial architecture, driven by the desire to mitigate dependency on a singular dominant currency and to foster a more multipolar financial world. This strategic diversification aims not only to reflect the changing geoeconomic realities and shifting global supplies but also to provide a buffer against geopolitical uncertainties and the economic dominance of any single nation.\n\nMoreover, the current geopolitical climate is markedly contributing to the irreversible disruption of global supply chains, a phenomenon that is reshaping international trade and economic dynamics. In this context of Cold War 2.0, a notable escalation in the competition for control over strategic global chokepoints is emerging. Vital maritime routes such as the Black Sea and the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait in the Red Sea are becoming arenas of intensified geopolitical contestation, as nations vie for influence over these critical junctures in global shipping. Concurrently, the North Sea Route will be gaining increased prominence as a pivotal link between Russia and China, offering a strategic alternative to traditional shipping lanes. This development is paralleled by the growing significance of land-based trade corridors. Initiatives like China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), and the recently proposed India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC) are increasingly central in facilitating cross-continental trade. These multimodal connectivity routes not only diversify the means of global trade but also reflect shifting alliances and economic priorities in a world where traditional supply chain models are being redefined by geopolitical realities. The outcome of these developments is a more fragmented and competitive landscape for global trade, with far-reaching implications for international relations.\n\nVital maritime routes such as the Black Sea and the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait in the Red Sea are becoming arenas of intensified geopolitical contestation, as nations vie for influence over these critical junctures in global shipping.\n\nChina's stance towards Taiwan, a crucial and sensitive issue in contemporary geopolitics, is characterised more by a strategy of attrition rather than the urgency of a full-scale military invasion. While the possibility of such an attack cannot be entirely discounted, it is not deemed the most probable scenario given the complex international repercussions it would entail. Instead, China seems to be employing a multifaceted approach that tactically combines enhanced military pressure with political infiltration and socio-economic coercion.\n\nThis methodical strategy aims to gradually undermine Taiwan's resistance and assert Beijing's influence over the island. Military manoeuvres in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea serve as demonstrations of power and intent, while political tactics are designed to sway public opinion and erode internal support for independence following Taiwan's election of DPP former vice-president Lai Ching-te. Economic measures, such as trade restrictions, are used to exert financial pressure. This nuanced approach reflects China's long-term 'death by thousand cuts' strategic approach to Taiwan, balancing its desire for unification with the need to manage the risks of direct conflict and international condemnation.\n\nThe Israel-Hamas conflict, a longstanding geopolitical issue, shows strong signs of persisting into 2024. While the possibility of this escalating into a larger regional war is currently assessed as low, the situation remains volatile, with potential de-escalation anticipated in the coming spring or summer. The enduring hope for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to be a subject of international discourse, although achieving this remains complex and fraught with significant humanitarian concerns. Complicating the regional dynamics are the spillover effects from other conflicts in the Middle East. Notably, the Iran-backed Houthi's attacks on commercial shipping in the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait have significant implications for global trade, prompting the rerouting of commodities shipping around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, a key BRICS partner. These incidents reflect the broader tensions in the Middle East, illustrating the complex web of cascading geopolitical effects that continue to challenge peace and security in the region and beyond.\n\nThe enduring hope for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to be a subject of international discourse, although achieving this remains complex and fraught with significant humanitarian concerns.\n\nAs we look ahead to 2024, the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine shows no immediate signs of resolution, with the likelihood of its continuation into the foreseeable future. However, there appears to be a glimmer of hope for diplomacy, as potential talks are speculated to emerge this autumn. These discussions, if they materialise, could mark a critical juncture in this prolonged war. In the interim, Russia is poised to face significant internal political challenges amid a presidential election campaign in spring, potentially leading to substantial political reshuffling in the upcoming years.\n\nMoreover, the prospect of Ukraine's territorial partition remains a concerning possibility. This risk is heightened by the absence of a unified strategic consensus among Western nations, particularly regarding the desired outcome of Ukraine's victory and the re-establishment of its borders as recognised internationally in 1991. This slow delivery of military aid and the lack of strategic vision on behalf of the European Union (EU) states not only complicates the diplomatic landscape but also adds to the uncertainty surrounding the future territorial integrity of Ukraine.\n\nAs the world grapples with the escalating tensions of Cold War 2.0, a new Iron Curtain appears poised to emerge, this time along NATO's Eastern Flank and Russia's West Flank. This geopolitical divide is expected to stretch from the icy expanses of the Arctic to the strategic waters of the Baltic, Black Sea, and the Eastern Mediterranean, encapsulating a vast region that includes Scandinavia, the Baltic states, Central and Eastern Europe, and T\u00fcrkiye, and once again create a bifurcated Europe similar to the first Cold War. This significant development in the global security architecture coincides with a momentous occasion -- the 75 anniversary of NATO, which will be commemorated with celebrations in Washington. This symbolic convergence of events underscores the shifting geopolitical landscape and the renewed significance of NATO in countering emerging threats and bolstering security along its northern and eastern boundaries. The formation of this new barrier is more than a mere physical demarcation; it represents a deepening ideological and strategic rift between the alliance and its adversaries, marking a profound transformation in the geopolitical order of the 21 century.\n\nRussia is poised to face significant internal political challenges amid a presidential election campaign in spring, potentially leading to substantial political reshuffling in the upcoming years.\n\nThe upcoming years are set to witness a pivotal shift in global dynamics, prominently marked by India's inevitable rise in both geopolitical and geoeconomic spheres. India, with its burgeoning economy and demographics, strategic location, and growing influence, is poised to play a more significant role on the world stage. This ascendancy is not just emblematic of India's own growth, but it also reflects a broader trend: The increasing importance of the Global South in shaping international affairs. This shift will be particularly visible in high-profile international forums such as the G20, set to be hosted by Brazil, and the BRICS Summit in Russia. These platforms will provide opportunities for countries in the Global South, led by India, to exert greater influence on global economic policies, development agendas, and geopolitical strategies. As these nations assert their voices and interests more forcefully, the traditional balance of power and decision-making in international politics is likely to see a significant realignment, marking a new era in global governance.\n\nLast but not least, the year 2024 is poised to be a landmark period in global politics, marked by what is being termed as an 'election supercycle.' This phase is distinguished by a significant number of electoral events around the world, and more notably, by a pronounced surge in populism across the political spectrum, from the left to the right. This rise in populism reflects a growing disillusionment with traditional political establishments and a shift towards more extreme, often nationalist, ideologies. The outcomes of these elections are likely to reshape policies and alliances, as political leaders will also pursue more protectionist and isolationist agendas. This trend could lead to increased unpredictability in international diplomacy, shifts in global trade and security policies, and potentially, a reconfiguration of long-standing alliances. The 2024 'election supercycle', thus, is a critical juncture, one that could redefine the contours of global politics in the years to come.\n\nThe Cold War 2.0 paradigm aptly captures the essence of current international relations, characterised by strategic competition, regional conflicts, geoeconomic and technological bifurcation, and the looming spectre of military escalation.\n\nIn conclusion, as the world navigates through this complex and evolving geopolitical landscape, the interplay between the US and the DragonBear alliance will underpin much of the global and regional tensions and realignment. The Cold War 2.0 paradigm aptly captures the essence of current international relations, characterised by strategic competition, regional conflicts, geoeconomic and technological bifurcation, and the looming spectre of military escalation. The resolution of these tensions, or the lack thereof, will undoubtedly shape the geopolitical contours of the 21 century.\n\nVelina Tchakarova is Founder of FACE and Visiting Fellow at the Observer Research Foundation.\n\nThe views expressed above belong to the author(s).

        "text": "This decision follows recent reports of Indian-manufactured drones being transported to Tel Aviv.\n\nThe Water Transport Workers Federation of India (WTWFI) issued a statement on 14 February declaring their stance to \"refuse to load or unload weaponised cargoes\" from Israel or any other country involved in the \"war in Palestine\".\n\n\"We, the Port workers, part of labour unions, would always stand against the war and killing of innocent people like women and children,\" a statement by the Union said.\n\n\"Women and children have been blown to pieces in the war. Parents were unable to recognise their children killed in bombings that were exploding everywhere,\" it added.\n\nThe Union, comprising over 3,500 employees at 11 government-owned ports in India, called for an \"immediate ceasefire\", while adding, \"Loading and unloading these weapons helps provide organisations with the ability to kill innocent people.\"\n\nMoreover, WTWFI's General Secretary, Narendra Rao, affirmed that the resolution aligns with the World Federation of Trade Unions, and the collective choice was made during a meeting with international trade unions in Athens at the onset of the war.\n\nRao stated, \"We decided then that we would do our bit and not handle any weapon-laden cargo, which will go on to assist Israel to kill more women and children as we are seeing and reading every day in the news.\"\n\nHe said the statement was issued 'to express solidarity with Palestine'.\n\nSince 7 October, Israel has been waging a devastating war on the Gaza Strip, resulting in tens of thousands of casualties, most of whom are children and women, in addition to an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe and a noticeable deterioration in infrastructure and properties, according to Palestinian and international data. This has led to Israel facing charges of violations of the Genocide Convention before the International Court of Justice.\n\nMNA/",

        "text": "New Delhi: According to the US military, a drone fired from Iran has hit a Japanese-owned chemical tanker located around 370 kilometres from the Indian coast off Gujarat, the BBC reported on December 24. Though the hit caused structural damage, no casualties have been reported and a fire aboard the tanker was put out. The Indian navy has sent an aircraft and warships for assistance, per the report.\n\nBBC reported that in a statement, the Pentagon said that the tanker - named \"Chem Pluto\", donning a Liberian flag and operated by the Netherlands - was hit by \"a one-way attack drone fired from Iran\". The AFP reported that per the statement, the US military is in communication with the vessel \"as it continues toward a destination in India\" from Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe incident occurred on December 23 (06:00 GMT), per the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO), which provides information on maritime security in the Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Arabian Sea. The UKMTO reported that it received news of an attack \"approximately 200 NM [nautical miles] South West of Veraval, India\", and that \"authorities are investigating\".\n\nThe attack comes at a time when drone and missile strikes by Houthi rebels - an Iran-backed group which controls a large part of Yemen - have been on the rise in the Red Sea, which is an important shipping route. According to BBC, the attacks began after the Israel-Hamas war, with the Houthis declaring their support for Hamas. Their means of showing this support has been by attacking cargo and commercial vessels bound for, or linked to, Israel.\n\nAs a result, many shipping companies have stopped going via the Red Sea, choosing to reroute their vessels south of Africa despite the longer route and higher fuel costs. The US, along with more than 20 countries, has set up a multinational naval task force to protect ship movements in the Red Sea.\n\nAccording to the AFP, it is the first time that the US has openly accused Iran, which is known to support Hamas, of directly targeting ships since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Per BBC, Iran has not commented on the drone attack on the vessel yet.\n\nLast month Israel had alleged that Yemen's Houthi rebels were responsible for the hijacking of an Israeli-linked cargo ship headed from Turkey to India via the Red Sea. The hijacked vessel had been in Korfez, Turkey, and was on its way to Pipavav, India, at the time of the seizure reported by Israel.",

The Brazilian G20 presidency said this month that the Gaza War as well as the Ukraine crisis would be the major focal areas at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting.'Not Sure if G20 Consensus on Ukraine Would Hold'Singh said that it would be \"dangerous to predict\" if the consensus on the Ukraine issue among G20 countries at the New Delhi Summit last September would hold under the Brazilian Presidency.While Moscow has said that it is open to negotiations to end the conflict, Kiev and its western partners have proposed a series of conditions to begin peace talks. The conditions have been rejected by Moscow.Expect Brazil to Focus on Priorities of Global South Like IndiaTrigunayat remarked that he expected the Brazilian G20 presidency to continue to focus on the developmental priorities of the Global South, much like India did during its G20 presidency.Trigunayat noted that being part of the G20 'Troika' along with Brazil and South Africa, India would jointly like to focus on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and advocate for reforming global governance.",

        "title": "Ukraine war has exposed the folly - and unintended consequences - of 'armed missionaries'",
        "text": "The evening before Russia invaded Ukraine, it seemed to many observers - me included - nearly unimaginable that Putin would carry through with weeks of a threatened military attack. As I wrote at the time, Putin is not as erratic or rash as he is sometimes painted.\n\nI had failed to take into account that Putin is, in the words of French statesman and revolutionary Maximilien Robespierre, an \"armed missionary.\" Writing in 1792, Robespierre explained, \"The most extravagant idea that can take root in the head of a politician is to believe that it is enough for one people to invade a foreign people to make it adopt its laws and constitution. No one likes armed missionaries; and the first advice given by nature and prudence is to repel them as enemies.\"\n\nThose words seem fitting as Vladimir Putin's disastrous war in Ukraine reaches a grim first anniversary on Feb. 24, 2023.\n\nPutin's decision marked the beginning of a year of massive destruction and death in Ukraine and of extraordinary costs - both economic and in lives lost - for Russia.\n\nIt was also a colossal blunder on Putin's part: It has weakened Russia significantly, solidified the NATO powers around the leadership of the United States and created a more unified, nationally conscious Ukraine than had existed before the war.\n\nImperial overreach\n\nAs a fading power, Putin's Russia has refused to accept its own limitations, both economically and militarily. In invading its smaller neighbor, Russia made a bid to upset the international system headed by the United States. It also sought to establish its own hegemony over Ukraine, and by implication, over much of the former Soviet Union.\n\nBut Russia's failure to \"decapitate\" the Ukrainian government, which in turn inspired heroic resistance by Ukrainians, proved a disastrous example of what might be called \"imperial overreach\" - when a state tries to expand or control other states beyond its own capacity to do so.\n\nIt has produced a weakened Russia - an isolated pariah state perceived as a threat to democracies and the rules-based liberal international security system.\n\nMeanwhile, Putin's diatribes against the West have evolved from complaints about the expansion of NATO to attacking the permissive culture of the West.\n\nPutin deploys rhetoric about dangerously subversive liberal, democratic values and practices - echoing right-wing politicians like Hungary's Victor Orb\u00e1n and Giorgia Meloni, the far-right Italian leader. It appears that a new \"International\" - just as ominous to the liberal West as the Communist International was - is being formed of illiberal and authoritarian states, with Russia a key member.\n\nThis view of the Ukrainian war as a cultural struggle plays in the Russian media as an emotional rallying cry to mobilize the basest fears of Putin's people.\n\nPropaganda disguised as news, social media posts and the screeds of government officials are being deployed to shape ordinary Russians' perceptions of the war.\n\nToward a multipolar world?\n\nThe consequences of Putin's miscalculation are not limited to the war itself, or to Europe. Rather, they have had reverberations far beyond the battlefields of Ukraine and the homes of Russians whose sons have been slaughtered or fled abroad.\n\nPutin's imperial aggression against Ukraine - implausibly proclaimed to be a defense of a united Russia and of Ukrainian peoples against Nazi usurpers - has a long genealogy.\n\nEver since his famous speech at the Munich Security Forum in 2007, Russia's president has railed against the \"unipolar\" military and economic dominance of the United States. What he wants is \"multipolarity\" - that is, the ability of other great powers to hold sway over their neighborhoods.\n\nIn such a multipolar world, Ukraine and Georgia would never join NATO and much of the former Soviet Union would fall under the umbrella of Russia. China would have paramount influence in East Asia, likewise India in South Asia. And perhaps this is Iran's ambition in much of the Middle East.\n\nTo countries hostile to the United States - and even to some friendly states - this multipolar rearrangement of the international order has considerable appeal.\n\nYes, the war in Ukraine has solidified the Western alliance around its idea of the rules-based international order that has been in place since 1945. But it has also awakened the aspirations of \"the Global South\" - those countries in neither NATO nor the former Soviet bloc, largely in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nCountries from Latin America and Africa to Pacific Island nations have urged a greater dispersion and sharing of international clout. The two most populous countries in the world, India and China, have expressed their support for a new multipolar international order and have not been openly critical of Russia's aggression against Ukraine.\n\nRedefining regional, global power struggles\n\nThe war in Ukraine has also had ripple effects on other global tensions.\n\nWith Taiwan as a potential flashpoint and saber-rattling by North Korea, Japan, South Korea and the Philippines are gravitating toward closer military cooperation with the United States in East Asia. China and North Korea are moving in the opposite direction, closer to Russia.\n\nThe Ukraine war is also reshaping the long-festering conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Both states desire sovereign power over the disputed region of mountainous Karabakh. But with Russia bogged down militarily and economically, Putin has been disinclined to aid Armenia, its one loyal ally in the South Caucasus. This is despite the fact that Azerbaijan has repeatedly violated the borders of its neighbor.\n\nAzerbaijan, by contrast, has been increasingly aided by its regional allies Israel - spurred by a shared hostility to Iran - and Turkey. Both have supplied Azerbaijan with advanced weaponry, giving the country an upper hand in the conflict.\n\nThe Ukraine conflict also has an effect on the great global power struggle to come: China and U.S. With EU states and regional rivals to China forging closer ties with Washington, Beijing may eye a growing threat - or even an opportunity to exert its influence more aggressively as regional power dynamics evolve.\n\nAmerican policymakers in both the Trump and Biden administrations have warned that the rise of China, economically and militarily, is a serious threat to the continued position of the U.S. as the strongest, richest state on the globe. To its competitors on the global stage, the U.S. also looks like an armed missionary.\n\nThe uncertainty of the Ukraine war, and the still uncertain ways in which it is reshaping geopolitics, will do little to dislodge those fears. Rather, it may encourage international relations scholars, such as Harvard professor Graham Allison, who believe in the \"Thucydides' Trap.\" Based on the ancient Greek historian's explanation for the origins of the Peloponnesian War, the theory has it that when an emerging power threatens to displace a regional or global hegemon, war is inevitable.\n\nAs someone trained to look to the past to understand the present and possible futures, I believe that nothing in history is inevitable; human beings always have choices. This was true for Putin on the eve of the Feb. 24, 2022, invasion, and it is true for policymakers around the world today.\n\nBut the decision to invade Ukraine underscores a clear danger: When statesmen perceive the world as a Darwinian zero-sum game of winners and losers, a clash between the West and the rest, or as an ideological conflict between autocracies and democracies, they can create the conditions - through provocation, threat or even invasion - that lead to wars with unintended consequences.\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation, an independent nonprofit news site dedicated to sharing ideas from academic experts.

        "title": "Crude Prices Settle Lower on Equity Market Weakness",
        "text": "Crude oil and gasoline prices on Tuesday gave up overnight gains and posted moderate losses. Crude fell back from a 3-1/2 month high Tuesday as weakness in stocks undercut economic optimism and was negative for energy demand and crude prices. Crude initially moved higher Tuesday after the dollar index dropped to a 2-week low. Also, oil prices have support from concerns about the possible escalation of the Israel-Hamas war to Lebanon and attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea by Yemen's Houthi rebels.\n\nWeakness in the crude crack spread is bearish for oil prices as the crack spread Tuesday fell to a 5-week low. The weaker crack spread discourages refiners from purchasing crude oil and refining it into gasoline and distillates.\n\nGlobal economic news Tuesday was mixed for energy demand and crude prices. On the negative side, U.S. Jan leading indicators fell -0.4% m/m, weaker than expectations of -0.3 % m/m and the fifteenth consecutive monthly decline. Conversely, Eurozone Dec construction output rose +0.8% m/m, the largest increase in 10 months.\n\nCrude prices are supported by concern that the Israel-Hamas war will widen to Lebanon after the leader of Hezbollah said it would retaliate against Israel and hit \"not just army sites\" in Israel after Israel attacked positions and killed civilians in Lebanon. Hezbollah and Israel have traded fire almost daily since the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct 7. Also, the U.S. and UK have engaged in airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen in retaliation for Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels have forced shippers to divert shipments around the southern tip of Africa instead of going through the Red Sea, disrupting global crude oil supplies.\n\nCrude prices also have support from Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries and oil storage facilities that have curtailed Russian fuel exports. On Feb 3, a drone attack by Ukraine damaged Russia's Lukoil PJSC facility in Volgograd, which processed 289,000 bpd of crude oil in January, or more than 5% of Russia's total crude processing volume. On Jan 25, a drone attack damaged Russia's Rosneft PJSC's major Tuapse refinery on Russia's Black Sea coast. Russia said on Jan 26 that the Tuapse refinery, which processed 180,000 bpd of crude in the first half of January, will be shut down through at least February. In recent weeks, several Russian oil processing and storage facilities have been targeted and damaged by Ukrainian drone attacks, increasing the risks of reducing Russian crude exports.\n\nA decline in Russian crude oil exports is supportive of crude oil prices. Tanker-tracking data from Vortexa, monitored by Bloomberg, shows Russian crude exports in the week to Feb 11 fell about -290,000 bpd from the prior week to 3.49 million bpd.\n\nStrong oil-product consumption in India, the world's third largest crude consumer, is bullish for oil prices after India's Jan oil-product consumption rose +8.3% y/y to 20 MMT, the most in 9 months.\n\nA decline in crude in floating storage is bullish for prices. Monday's weekly data from Vortexa showed that the amount of crude oil held worldwide on tankers that have been stationary for at least a week fell -19% w/w to 73.18 million bbl as of Feb 16.\n\nOn Nov 30, OPEC+ agreed to cut crude production by -1.0 million bpd through June 2024. However, a Bloomberg survey on Thursday showed the group cut production by only -490,000 bpd in January, less than the official -1.0 million bpd cut. Meanwhile, on Dec 21, Angola announced it was leaving OPEC amid a dispute over oil production quotas.\n\nSaudi Arabia said on Nov 30 that it would maintain its unilateral crude production cut of 1.0 million bpd through Q1-2024. The move would maintain Saudi Arabia's crude output at about 9 million bpd, the lowest level in three years. Russia also said it will deepen its voluntary oil export cuts by 200,000 bpd to 500,000 bpd in Q1 of 2024. OPEC Jan crude production fell -1.59 million bpd to 26.570 million bpd, a 2-1/2 year low.\n\nLast Wednesday's EIA report showed that (1) U.S. crude oil inventories as of Feb 9 were -2.1% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -2.2% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -7.9% below the 5-year seasonal average. U.S. crude oil production in the week ended Feb 9 was unchanged w/w at a record high of 13.3 million bpd.\n\nBaker Hughes reported last Friday that active U.S. oil rigs in the week ended Feb 16 fell by -2 rigs to 497 rigs, just above the 2-year low of 494 rigs posted on Nov 10. The number of U.S. oil rigs has fallen over the past year from the 3-3/4 year high of 627 rigs posted in December 2022.\n\nMore Crude Oil News from Barchart\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Weekly Briefing: How much does the Biden administration truly prioritize a two-state solution?",
        "text": "Brian Katulis\n\nSenior Fellow for U.S. Foreign Policy and Senior Advisor to the President\n\nNegotiations between Israel and Hamas to achieve a temporary cease-fire and release of hostages failed yet again this past week. The lack of diplomatic success prompted Israeli war cabinet minister Benny Gantz to threaten to expand Israel's ground offensive to Rafah, in southern Gaza along the border with Egypt, by the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, in the second week of March.\n\nThe Biden administration urged Israel to drop its plans for expanding the ground offensive into Rafah, where most of the Palestinians displaced in Gaza have moved since the start of the war more than four months ago. At the same time, the United States vetoed a United Nations resolution put forward this morning by Algeria calling for an immediate cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, and instead proposed an alternative measure with a different formulation aimed at sending a message about the risks of a Rafah military offensive.\n\nThe next three weeks are increasingly shaping up to be a crucial and defining period in the Gaza war and more broadly in the Middle East. Worries are growing that the ongoing war and simmering tensions across the region could spike substantially in March and April, when Muslim, Jewish, and Christian holidays are set to take place. Amid talk inside of the Israeli government about setting limits on Muslims' access to holy sites in Jerusalem, and with ongoing tensions in the West Bank and across the region, the Biden administration is worried about more flare-ups that could ignite a wider regional conflagration at a time when it has stepped up US military actions against Iran-backed groups in Yemen, the Red Sea, Syria, and Iraq.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of this short-term crisis management, the Biden administration is still dutifully working to advance a long-game agenda to support the idea of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel's current leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, have rejected this notion, saying it would be a \"huge reward for terrorism.\" Other key regional actors, namely Hamas and Iran, also reject the two-state solution idea.\n\nThis unfavorable landscape raises an important question for the Biden administration: How much does it truly prioritize progress toward a two-state solution between Israelis and Palestinians? After all, the combination of the grim realities on the ground plus political dynamics in the region make this a mighty tall order to achieve any progress anytime soon.\n\nWilliam Burns, President Joe Biden's Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director who has recently been a key figure in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas, wrote in his 2019 memoir, The Back Channel, that one mistake made in US foreign policy is to apply minimalist means to achieve maximalist ends. The crisis of efficacy in US foreign policy -- stating goals like achieving a two-state solution and then repeatedly falling short -- has a deleterious impact on America's ability to shape and influence events around the world.\n\nThe next few weeks are, thus, shaping up to be an important test of the Biden administration's efforts to achieve results and see some progress toward the goals it has set for itself in the Middle East.\n\nNasir Almasri\n\nGraduate Fellow, Program on Palestine and Palestinian-Israeli Affairs\n\nPrior to Oct. 7, Palestinian president and Fatah leader Mahmoud Abbas was already wildly unpopular, with over 90% of Palestinians desiring alternative leadership. Abbas was strongly disliked even among Fatah supporters, and the Palestinian Authority's (PA) legitimacy declined sharply among Palestinians more generally. The latter trend had become especially evident in the West Bank, where mounting violence -- including from the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade, a militant faction of Fatah that has gained independence -- was a serious problem for both Israel and the PA.\n\nThe 88-year-old president's limited response to the Gaza conflict and struggle to remain relevant throughout much of the war were finally broken when he visited Qatar this past week in an attempt to place himself at the center of negotiations over the post-war order in Gaza and to publicly pressure Hamas to accept a cease-fire and release captives. Though this has spurred public and private conversations about who might become the new Palestinian prime minister, it remains to be seen if the end of the war will bring an end to President Abbas' time in power. Indeed, his insistence on remaining in power is now complicating US reconstruction plans in Gaza that include the PA but likely exclude Abbas.\n\nHamas, on the other hand, appears to be in a relative position of strength politically when compared to Abbas, despite Israel's utter devastation of Gaza. Leaks from the highest levels of the Israeli military command suggest that eliminating Hamas is unlikely, and more recent Israel Defense Forces (IDF) intelligence reports indicate that Hamas will survive the war and maintain its popularity among Gazans.\n\nWhile news stories have surfaced that Hamas might be willing to join the PA in something like a consensus government and accept a two-state solution, others indicate only that it is willing to negotiate the future of Palestinian politics with Fatah and other groups independently of the United States and Israel. Indeed, Hamas called for elections and -- in coordination with other Palestinian factions -- released a statement rejecting \"day after\" discussions about Gaza. Moreover, it has demanded support from the League of Arab States, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and the United Nations to rebuild Gaza while providing Palestinians the autonomy to reconcile their differences and chart a path forward. Though elections seem a distant possibility, polls indicate that Hamas' Ismail Haniyeh would win a significant victory over Abbas, 78% to 16%. A power-sharing arrangement with Hamas also seems unlikely.\n\nYet it appears that Palestinians in the West Bank, the Israeli government, the US, and the Arab regimes involved in negotiations do not see continued benefit from Abbas. It remains to be seen if he can maneuver through this political crisis, if he can convince the US and Israel to enforce his hold on power, or if he will wither away instead.\n\nUp until a week ago it appeared that a widely foreseen post-election narrative was unfolding. Although Imran Khan's Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party's scoring of an election plurality had thrown things somewhat out of joint, Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) seemed poised to form the new government. Smaller parties and uncommitted independents anxious to be aligned with the winning side were predictably falling into line with the party of the three-time prime minister. The military, which had suffered a reputational blow with its unaccustomed failure to skillfully manipulate the election's outcome, seemed to be staging a comeback with its hand in the formation of a Nawaz-led coalition. Meanwhile, an imprisoned Khan seemed helpless to derail the establishment's prescribed political script.\n\nAnd then the political landscape swiftly changed, revealing the deep failings of Pakistan's electoral process and democratic order. Reports of ballot tampering have surfaced, casting doubt on the integrity of the election. The possibility of repolling looms as election officials acknowledge corruption within the electoral system and the country's top judiciary is contemplating intervention. Massive protest demonstrations, liable to result in violence, are in the making. And there are signs of discontent within the ranks over the military's handling of Khan.\n\nNew developments have further upset the possibility of a smooth transition of power. The commissioner of Rawalpindi, Islamabad's twin city and home to the Pakistan Army's headquarters, has publicly admitted to widespread rigging of the election. He alleges the involvement of Pakistan's chief elections commissioner and the country's chief justice, among others in the state bureaucracy. Charging the military as well with interference, Khan is challenging the election results in the courts in virtually all of the 85 contests lost by those who ran as independent surrogates for his banned party. Meanwhile, previous PTI loyalists who had broken from the party to run independently are reportedly thinking of returning to the fold.\n\nThe planned demonstrations by the PTI, along with other disgruntled parties, pose a significant risk not only to political stability but also to an already precarious economy. Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar ul-Haq Kakar has warned of \"hostile forces [...] trying to spread anarchy and disorder.\" Despite Khan's call that demonstrations remain peaceful, spokespeople for the PTI have warned that countrywide protests may see a repeat of the events of May 9, 2023. On that day, following Khan's arrest at the Islamabad High Court, demonstrations by PTI loyalists turned violent, and they attacked military installations with the believed intention of staging a coup against the Islamabad government.\n\nReflecting the complicated efforts to form a government, a deadlock has emerged in negotiations between the PML-N and the Pakistan People's Party (PPP), which had won the third largest number of seats in the National Assembly. The PPP in its demand for the country's presidency and for other constitutional positions has thus far been rebuffed by the PML-N. For its part, the PML-N now may be having second thoughts about forming a weak coalition government with the PPP. A disappointed PPP has left open the possibility that it might ally with the PTI. Though Khan has in the past rejected an alliance with either of the mainstream parties, his position seems to be softening. Speculation about the PTI returning to power has grown, especially since it announced Omar Ayub Khan as its stand-in choice for the post of prime minister; he is the grandson of Field Marshal Ayub Khan, the general who ruled the country for 10 years under imposed martial law in the late 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIf the momentum behind Khan continues to build, the possibility of forming a national unity government that includes the PTI may look increasingly attractive, even to the military establishment. But if the deadlock in forming a government persists, the courts, backed by the generals, could declare the election results null and void and direct the current caretaker system to stay in office until fresh elections can be held. Quite possibly, this action could trigger massive public resistance, leading the military to declare emergency rule or martial law.\n\nResearch assistant Naad-e-Ali Sulehria contributed to this piece.\n\nGerald M. Feierstein\n\nDistinguished Sr. Fellow on U.S. Diplomacy; Director, Arabian Peninsula Affairs\n\nAs India's prime minister, Narendra Modi has long lavished attention on his country's critical regional relationships in the Gulf. His visit to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates last week, Feb. 13-15, marks his 13th trip to the six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states since becoming prime minister a decade ago, including seven to the UAE, which had not received an Indian head of government in 34 years before Modi's first arrival in 2015.\n\nFor India, strong relations with the GCC are critical both for its foreign and domestic policies. The Gulf states are collectively India's largest trading partner, providing some 60% of India's oil imports. Qatar is its largest source of liquified natural gas. Similarly, the Gulf states are significant sources of foreign direct investment for the Indian economy. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman pledged that the Saudis would invest $100 billion in Indian enterprises when he visited in 2019, and the UAE has committed to provide $75 billion for India's infrastructure sector.\n\nCounter-balancing China's role as a Gulf economic player, India's growing presence not only as an economic but also as a defense and security partner for the Gulf states is increasingly important. The formation of the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) has the potential to compete with China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), while the I2U2 initiative (joining India, Israel, the UAE, and the United States) expands India's stabilizing role in West Asia. Meanwhile, last year's invitation to Saudi Arabia and the UAE to join the BRICS grouping (heretofore, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) adds to India's presence, strengthening the group of moderate, Western-oriented states in that organization.\n\nBy focusing his foreign policy initiatives on relations with the GCC, Modi also hasn't lost sight of the positive impact his relationship-building has at home. With some 9 million Indian nationals resident in the Gulf, nearly one-third of India's $90 billion in foreign remittances come from the region. At the same time, Modi's robust contacts with Gulf leaders enhance the status and security of the Indian population there. Notably, during his visit to Abu Dhabi, Modi took time to inaugurate the first-ever Hindu temple in the UAE. Given India's large Muslim population, strong ties to the Gulf are also an important policy initiative for that community.\n\nBolstering India's relations with the Gulf -- ensuring that India has alternatives to Russia for meeting its energy needs while moderating China's economic and political advances in the Gulf -- is also a critical element of the US strategy of confronting regional challenges from Moscow and Beijing. With Washington's regional position complicated by the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza, the growing links between New Delhi and the GCC states are likely to play a central role in the evolving US approach to its regional political, economic, and security interests.\n\nThe normalization of relations between Egypt and Turkey reached a new level with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan's visit to Cairo on Feb. 14, 2024. After years of friction, the two countries had started a normalization process in 2021, mainly on Turkey's initiative. The process moved slowly until the symbolic public handshake between the two leaders at the FIFA soccer World Cup in Qatar, in November 2022. The push for normalization stemmed from domestic and regional calculations on both sides and led to closer political and economic ties. Turkey's desire not to be isolated in the evolving regional order after the start of the normalization wave with the Abraham Accords and in the Eastern Mediterranean played a role. Egypt's economic needs and its quest to diversify its relations in the emerging regional order after the Abraham Accords were important factors in facilitating this shift as well. The narrowing of differences in the case of Libya, which had previously been a major point of contention, also had a significant impact. In particular, the shift in Egyptian policy from supporting Khalifa Hifter, the self-proclaimed head of the Libyan National Army who had failed to unseat the Tripoli government in the civil war, to reaching out to the Turkish-backed, Tripoli-based Government of National Unity opened up opportunities for rapprochement. As a result, in July 2023, the two sides appointed ambassadors for the first time in a decade.\n\nPresident Erdo\u011fan's recent visit focused on three areas of cooperation. First was the further expansion of economic ties, which have already benefited from normalization with $10 billion in trade and $3 billion in Turkish investment. Second was the possibility of increased cooperation in the defense industry, which has emerged as a new element in the bilateral relationship. Third, and more importantly, the visit took place in the context of the ongoing Israel-Gaza war. Cooperation with Egypt appears to be important for Turkey, which is seeking a role in the emerging post-conflict constellation by acting as one of the \"guarantors\" in any deal reached over Gaza. Thus, Erdo\u011fan's visit to Cairo marks a new phase in bilateral relations.\n\nMohammed Mahmoud\n\nSenior Fellow and Director of the Climate and Water Program\n\nEarlier last week, the United Arab Emirates, Azerbaijan, and Brazil -- respectively, the hosts of the recently concluded United Nations Climate Change Conference (28th Conference of the Parties, COP28) and the forthcoming COP29 and COP30 meetings -- announced that they would form a COP climate \"troika,\" principally to maintain the momentum for dedicated climate action set this past December at the climate summit in Dubai. Under the UAE's purview, COP28 saw progress on a number of fronts, such as on climate financing and a global commitment to transition away from fossil fuels. Even prior to the troika announcement, the UAE remained very much engaged in the COP process, as the country continues to retain the role of COP president until that responsibility passes to Azerbaijan at the start of COP29. And while it's not unusual for consecutive COP hosts to work together in the period between their respective climate conferences, much like what Egypt and the UAE did between COP27 and COP28, this is the first time that three COP hosts will closely coordinate their actions and agendas over the timeframe spanning their COP meetings.\n\nThis new approach offers several advantages. It helps Azerbaijan immensely, as its COP29 hosting duties were not confirmed until COP28, leaving Baku with a much shorter planning period than is usually the case for an upcoming COP host. Another advantage for Azerbaijan is that this troika will help prop up a climate conference saddled between two consequential COPs. Besides the slew of climate action announcements that came out of last year's meeting in Dubai, COP28 was also the highest-attended COP to date. COP30, in 2025, is similarly expected to be a high-profile meeting with ambitious objectives, given Brazil's (and President Lula de Silva's) commitment to the environmental and biodiversity side of the climate crisis. It is even Brazil's intention to host the meeting in the Amazon, in the city of Bel\u00e9m of Par\u00e1.\n\nFinally, this partnership allows for the progress achieved at COP28, and whatever additional measures come out of COP29, to carry through to COP30, limiting the likelihood of disjointed agendas and abandoned initiatives. But most importantly, this troika can conjunctively hold the global parties to the Paris Agreement accountable to meeting the COP commitments set forth regarding energy transition, climate financing, and adaptation so that the goal of keeping future global warming below 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius can still be possible. As 2023 -- the hottest year on record -- illustrated, the window for effectively curbing the current alarming trajectory of climate change is closing faster than we may have originally thought.",

        "text": "The Suez Canal's revenue has fallen by up to 50% this year due to attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said on Monday, the latest indication that the turmoil in the Red Sea is hurting Egypt's fragile economy.\n\nSisi said during a conference with oil companies that Suez Canal revenue has decreased 40-50% so far this year. \"Egypt must continue to pay companies and partners,\" he lamented, according to Agence France-Presse.\n\nThe remarks follow a similar assessment by the Suez Canal Authority last month. The authority's head, Osama Rabie, said then that traffic fell 30% from Jan. 1-11, while dollar revenues dropped 40%.\n\nThe decreased revenue is due to attacks by the Houthi rebels in Yemen on international ships in the Red Sea. The Iran-backed group has intensified attacks on ships in the strategic waterway, which connects to the Suez Canal, for years, since the start of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The Houthis say the ships they attack are connected to Israel, though many of them have no ties to the country.\n\nSeveral rounds of US and UK airstrikes have thus far failed to deter the Houthis. On Monday, the group hit the Belize-flagged carrier Rubymar with a missile.\n\nThe French Defense Ministry said on Tuesday it shot down two drones over the Red Sea overnight, originating from Yemen\n\nMany international shipping firms have been avoiding the Suez Canal by sailing around the African continent in order to evade the attacks.\n\nWhy it matters: The decrease in Suez Canal revenue could worsen Egypt's foreign currency shortage. The shortage has its roots in the COVID-19 pandemic, when tourism decreased. Rising oil and wheat prices following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine exacerbated the situation. The canal is another major source of foreign currency for Egypt, and revenue reached a record $9.4 billion during the fiscal year that ended last June.\n\nThe US credit rating giant S&P Global reported in January that Egypt's \"already constrained foreign-currency position is suffering from the reduction in traffic through the Suez Canal.\"\n\nSome Egyptian banks placed restrictions on foreign currency transactions in January due to the shortage, Bloomberg reported at the time, following similar moves in October.\n\nThe foreign currency shortage is not the only economic issue plaguing Egypt. Annual inflation hit an all-time high of 39.7% last August. Inflation has eased somewhat since then and was 35.2% in December.\n\nSisi announced several wage hikes for Egyptian workers last week in an effort to ease their economic burdens.\n\nThe Egyptian Central Bank has also devalued the pound three times since early 2022 in order to unlock a $3 billion aid package from the International Monetary Fund. One stipulation of the aid is a transition to a more flexible exchange rate.\n\nOne US dollar is currently worth 31 Egyptian pounds. S&P Global predicted in January that Egypt will devalue the pound further to make the official rate closer to the rate on the street of approximately 60 pounds to the dollar.\n\nKnow more: India and the United Arab Emirates pledged last week to further advance the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor. The shipping and rail network would establish a trade corridor from India to Europe via the Arabian peninsula and Israel, thus bypassing the Suez Canal.",

At a discussion at the Munich Security Conference, Jaishankar said the Hamas attack was \"terrorism...no caveats\", and that the return of the hostages was \"imperative\". He also said that \"...Israel should have been very mindful of civilian casualties, it has an international obligation to observe humanitarian law\".\n\nThe only regret is that India did not say this earlier. Indeed, before this, India had dodged several opportunities to take an explicit stand against the horrific human toll that Israel has extracted in Gaza as it used its right to \"self-defence\" -- the latest numbers are 29,000 killed, two-thirds of them women and children.

Parents were unable to recognise their children killed in bombings that were exploding everywhere,\" it added.\n\nThe Union, comprising over 3,500 employees at 11 government-owned ports in India, called for an \"immediate ceasefire\", while adding, \"Loading and unloading these weapons helps provide organisations with the ability to kill innocent people.\"\n\nMoreover, WTWFI's General Secretary, Narendra Rao, affirmed that the resolution aligns with the World Federation of Trade Unions and the collective choice was made during a meeting with international trade unions in Athens at the onset of the war.\n\nRao stated, \"We decided then that we would do our bit and not handle any weapon-laden cargo, which will go on to assist Israel to kill more women and children as we are seeing and reading every day in the news.\"\n\nHe said the statement was issued 'to express solidarity with Palestine'.\n\nSince 7 October, Israel has been waging a devastating war on the Gaza Strip, resulting in tens of thousands of casualties, most of whom are children and women, in addition to an unprecedented humanitarian catastrophe and a noticeable deterioration in infrastructure and properties, according to Palestinian and international data.

        "text": "March WTI crude oil (CLH24) this morning is down -0.33 (-0.42%), and Mar RBOB gasoline (RBH24) is down -3.80 (-1.63%).\n\nCrude oil and gasoline prices this morning gave up overnight gains and are moderately lower. Crude fell back from a 3-1/2 month high today as weakness in stocks undercuts economic optimism and is negative for energy demand and crude prices. Crude initially moved higher today after the dollar index dropped to a 2-week low. Also, oil prices have support from concerns about the possible escalation of the Israel-Hamas war to Lebanon and attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea by Yemen's Houthi rebels.\n\nWeakness in the crude crack spread is bearish for oil prices as the crack spread today fell to a 5-week low. The weaker crack spread discourages refiners from purchasing crude oil and refining it into gasoline and distillates.\n\nGlobal economic news today was mixed for energy demand and crude prices. On the negative side, U.S. Jan leading indicators fell -0.4% m/m, weaker than expectations of -0.3 % m/m and the fifteenth consecutive monthly decline. Conversely, Eurozone Dec construction output rose +0.8% m/m, the largest increase in 10 months.\n\nCrude prices are supported by concern that the Israel-Hamas war will widen to Lebanon after the leader of Hezbollah said it would retaliate against Israel and hit \"not just army sites\" in Israel after Israel attacked positions and killed civilians in Lebanon. Hezbollah and Israel have traded fire almost daily since the Israel-Hamas war erupted on Oct 7. The U.S. and UK have engaged in airstrikes against Houthi rebels in Yemen in retaliation for Houthi attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. Attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels have forced shippers to divert shipments around the southern tip of Africa instead of going through the Red Sea, disrupting global crude oil supplies.\n\nCrude prices also have support from Ukrainian drone attacks on Russian refineries and oil storage facilities that have curtailed Russian fuel exports. On Feb 3, a drone attack by Ukraine damaged Russia's Lukoil PJSC facility in Volgograd, which processed 289,000 bpd of crude oil in January, or more than 5% of Russia's total crude processing volume. On Jan 25, a drone attack damaged Russia's Rosneft PJSC's major Tuapse refinery on Russia's Black Sea coast. Russia said on Jan 26 that the Tuapse refinery, which processed 180,000 bpd of crude in the first half of January, will be shut down through at least February. In recent weeks, several Russian oil processing and storage facilities have been targeted and damaged by Ukrainian drone attacks, increasing the risks of reducing Russian crude exports.\n\nA decline in Russian crude oil exports is supportive of crude oil prices. Tanker-tracking data from Vortexa, monitored by Bloomberg, shows Russian crude exports in the week to Feb 11 fell about -290,000 bpd from the prior week to 3.49 million bpd.\n\nStrong oil-product consumption in India, the world's third largest crude consumer, is bullish for oil prices after India's Jan oil-product consumption rose +8.3% y/y to 20 MMT, the most in 9 months.\n\nA decline in crude in floating storage is bullish for prices. Monday's weekly data from Vortexa showed that the amount of crude oil held worldwide on tankers that have been stationary for at least a week fell -19% w/w to 73.18 million bbl as of Feb 16.\n\nOn Nov 30, OPEC+ agreed to cut crude production by -1.0 million bpd through June 2024. However, a Bloomberg survey on Thursday showed the group cut production by only -490,000 bpd in January, less than the official -1.0 million bpd cut. Meanwhile, on Dec 21, Angola announced it was leaving OPEC amid a dispute over oil production quotas.\n\nSaudi Arabia said on Nov 30 that it would maintain its unilateral crude production cut of 1.0 million bpd through Q1-2024. The move would maintain Saudi Arabia's crude output at about 9 million bpd, the lowest level in three years. Russia also said it will deepen its voluntary oil export cuts by 200,000 bpd to 500,000 bpd in Q1 of 2024. OPEC Jan crude production fell -1.59 million bpd to 26.570 million bpd, a 2-1/2 year low.\n\nLast Wednesday's EIA report showed that (1) U.S. crude oil inventories as of Feb 9 were -2.1% below the seasonal 5-year average, (2) gasoline inventories were -2.2% below the seasonal 5-year average, and (3) distillate inventories were -7.9% below the 5-year seasonal average. U.S. crude oil production in the week ended Feb 9 was unchanged w/w at a record high of 13.3 million bpd.\n\nBaker Hughes reported last Friday that active U.S. oil rigs in the week ended Feb 16 fell by -2 rigs to 497 rigs, just above the 2-year low of 494 rigs posted on Nov 10. The number of U.S. oil rigs has fallen over the past year from the 3-3/4 year high of 627 rigs posted in December 2022.\n\nMore Crude Oil News from Barchart\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Asplund did not have (either directly or indirectly) positions in any of the securities mentioned in this article.

        "text": "MIRAN SHAH, Pakistan -- Mohsin Dawar's campaign for re-election to Pakistan's parliament was almost cut short before it began in early January when his convoy was ambushed in a village just a few minutes' drive from his home in Miran Shah in Pakistan's North Waziristan district, near the lawless borderlands with Afghanistan. As his car came under attack from militants armed with automatic weapons, sniper rifles, and rocket-propelled grenades, he and his team were lured into a compound by residents who promised them safety.\n\nIt was a trap. Once the gates closed behind Dawar, the attack intensified. For almost an hour, he said, they were pinned down. Police and Pakistan Army backup finally arrived but not before two of Dawar's team had been shot and injured. The vehicle took more than 80 bullets, and the windows show just how accurate the attackers' aim was: Either one of the shots to the windshield or passenger window would have struck and likely killed him if he hadn't been protected by bulletproof glass.\n\nThe Jan. 3 attack on a popular, outspoken, liberal leader in one of the most vulnerable regions of a country fighting a growing insurgency by extremist militants hardly registered in Pakistan, where most believe the military attempted -- and failed -- to manipulate the Feb. 8 election in an effort to install Nawaz Sharif as prime minister for a fourth time and where media operate under tight government control.\n\nThe election wasn't quite the foregone conclusion that had been expected, with candidates aligned with the jailed cricket star-turned-populist leader Imran Khan winning more votes than each of the major parties -- the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party -- forcing them into a coalition to get the majority needed to form a government. PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif nominated his brother, Shehbaz Sharif, to become prime minister and his daughter Maryam Nawaz as chief minister of Punjab province, ensuring the dynastic line continues.\n\nCandidates across the country, not only those loyal to Khan, alleged that the results had been rigged against them and in favor of military-backed candidates. Two days after the election, with his seat still undeclared amid growing concerns nationwide about vote rigging, Dawar and about a dozen of his supporters were injured when security forces opened fire on them as they gathered outside the official counting room.\n\nAt least three people died of their injuries; What Dawar had believed was an unassailable lead, according to polling by his secular National Democratic Movement party, had disappeared. In the count that was listed as final by Pakistan's Election Commission, the seat went to Misbah Uddin of the Taliban-aligned Jamiat Ulama-e-Islam-Fazl party. Dawar is still recovering from a serious leg wound.\n\nDawar's hometown is, once again, the battleground of what he calls \"Project Taliban\" -- a war against the Pakistani state.\n\nThe Taliban's transnational ambitions are threatening security beyond the borders of Afghanistan, and nowhere is this more evident than in Pakistan's northwest, where the militant presence has been growing since the terrorist-led group came back to power in August 2021. Attacks on civilians, soldiers, and police have soared. The region bristles with checkpoints and hilltop outposts and is heavily patrolled on the ground and in the air by the Pakistan Army and armed border police. That's during daylight hours, Dawar told Foreign Policy. Once night falls, it's a different story.\n\n\"The Army checkposts you will only see during the daytime. Before sunset, they go to their barracks, and the people of Waziristan are at the disposal of the militants. Everyone has to secure himself or herself for their own protection,\" he said. \"It is militarized, and I believe it is a continuation of a proxy war that was started long ago. 'Project Taliban' is still continuing.\"\n\nThe roots of militancy and terrorism in Waziristan go back to colonial times, when the mostly Pashtun people here were characterized as fearless fighters and pressed into service for the British. The stereotype stuck; the region became a center of recruitment and training for young men to fight the Soviets after Moscow's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nAfter the United States led an invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 in retaliation for the 9/11 attacks, leaders of the Taliban and al Qaeda moved over the border and for the following 20 years enjoyed the protection of the Pakistani military's intelligence wing, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency.\n\nThe ISI wanted a tame Taliban-led Afghanistan to thwart the ambitions of archrival India to become the dominant regional power. The Taliban had different ideas. The group's return to power has inspired affiliated and like-minded groups worldwide, as the extremist regime provides safe haven for dozens of militant groups, according to the U.N. Security Council. They now openly use Afghanistan as a base to train fighters seeking to overthrow governments from China and Tajikistan to Iran and Israel. Among them is Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which, Afrasiab Khattak, a former Pakistani lawmaker and now a political analyst, said, is \"just Taliban, there is no difference.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the Taliban reiterated the group's stance on the international border between Afghanistan and Pakistan when the acting foreign minister, Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai, said the government doesn't recognize the Durand Line that has delineated the two countries since 1893. The line runs through the tribal regions, dividing ethnic Pashtun and Baloch tribespeople. Recent bilateral tensions have often focused on the border, with tit-for-tat closures impacting cross-border trade.\n\nIn comments that Pakistan's foreign ministry later called \"fanciful\" and \"self-serving\" -- and which underlined the simmering hostility between Pakistan and the Taliban it helped put in power -- Stanikzai said: \"We have never recognized Durand and will never recognize it; today half of Afghanistan is separated and is on the other side of the Durand Line. Durand is the line which was drawn by the English on the heart of Afghans.\"\n\nThe Security Council said in 2022 that the TTP had up to 5,500 fighters in Afghanistan. That number has likely risen, Dawar said, as neither country, mired in economic mismanagement and crisis, can offer its youthful population an alternative livelihood. Victory brought strength, Dawar said, and the Taliban \"can attract the youth because money and power is what attracts youth the most.\"\n\nThe simmering conflict threatens to return Pakistan's northwest to the wasteland of less than decade ago, when the TTP controlled the region: Dissenters were routinely killed. Terrorists turned the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), now part of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province after an administrative merger in 2018, into a death zone. Millions of people were displaced as those who could leave fled to peace and safety.\n\nThose who stayed lived in fear and poverty until the Army finally took action in 2016 and ended the TTP's 10-year reign by simply killing them, often in attacks that also killed civilians, or pushing them over the porous border into Afghanistan, where they joined Taliban forces fighting the U.S.-supported republic until it collapsed in 2021.\n\nThe TTP wants an independent state in these border regions. It broke a cease-fire with the government in November 2022 and has demanded that the merger of the FATA with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa be reversed. Attacks on the military and police have escalated alarmingly, presenting what a senior government official, who spoke anonymously, called \"not only an existential threat to the state but also to the common man\" -- a recognition that what Dawar calls \"Project Taliban\" not only threatens to engulf the northwest but, if not contained, poses a potential threat to a fragile and barely stable state.\n\nCaretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar disagreed, telling reporters before the Feb. 8 vote that the military had the upper hand in the region, by virtue of numbers alone. \"I don't see that they pose an existential threat to the state of Pakistan,\" he said, while nevertheless conceding it was a \"big challenge\" that could take years to dislodge.\n\nHe could be right. After the failure of peace talks, ironically brokered by the Taliban's acting interior minister, U.N.-listed terrorist Sirajuddin Haqqani, Pakistan stepped up pressure on the TTP. Asfandyar Mir, an expert on South Asian political and security issues, said this appeared to have made a \"marginal\" difference.\n\n\"For instance, we haven't seen a complex or suicide bombing attack by the TTP or one of its fronts for a couple of months now,\" he said. \"In that sense, it appears the Taliban is sensitive to pressure,\" though \"smaller-scale attacks and the erosion of Pakistani state authority in parts of the northwest continue.\" Things could change, he said, once a new government is installed and, perhaps, brings some stability to the political landscape.\n\nFor the people of Waziristan, struggling to survive unemployment, a lack of development, and government neglect of basic services such as roads, electricity, clean water, and education -- coupled with a downturn in vital cross-border trade with Afghanistan -- priorities have again switched to peace. \"The local people have learned through their own bitter experience of devastating war\" what a Taliban resurgence means, said Khattak, the political analyst. The security establishment is playing a dangerous game, indulging the TTP so that \"local people become so desperate they want the military to come in and help them,\" he said.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people have marched through the streets and bazaars of North and South Waziristan over the past year, demanding action against terrorism and an end to state violence. Yet it continues. \"No one is safe. Everyone is a target,\" said a man in his 30s as he rolled off a list of potential victims: politicians, business people, teachers, doctors, journalists, civic activists, women's rights advocates, anyone deemed \"un-Islamic.\" Even barbers are not immune from extremists who ban men from shaving: The day before the Jan. 3 attack on Dawar's convoy, the bodies of six young hairdressers were found in the nearby town of Mir Ali.\n\nAnother local resident pointed to a \"Taliban checkpoint\" on the road between Miran Shah and the bustling town of Bannu. The long-haired, kohl-eyed, gun-toting youths in sequined caps stand outside their roadside hut in the shadow of an Army post on the hill above. Around the clock, the resident said, they randomly stop vehicles to shake down the drivers. \"It's just for money,\" he said. \"Money and power.\"\n\nBut it's killing, too, \"on a daily basis,\" said a government worker who left Miran Shah with his family at the height of the TTP terror and visited in early February from Peshawar so he and his wife could vote for Dawar. The aim, he said, is \"to create an atmosphere of fear so that people leave and what is here is theirs.\"\n\nDawar said the turning of the Taliban tables on Pakistan \"was predictable.\" The Taliban \"are now a threat to Central Asia. They are now a threat to Iran, to Pakistan, and to even China. All of them thought we will control the Taliban after the takeover. The problem is it didn't happen,\" he said.\n\nIn 2011, then-U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton warned Pakistan's leaders that they couldn't keep \"snakes,\" as she called the Taliban, in their own backyard and \"expect them only to bite your neighbors.\"\n\n\"There used to be a time when people were sent from here to Afghanistan. Now they are coming around, they are biting,\" Dawar said.",

        "title": "Decoding Iran's Strike and Pakistan's Counter Strike in the Geopolitical Context - The Geopolitics",
        "text": "Iran's surprising missile strike in Panjgur, Balochistan, caught the entire nation off guard, especially at a time when Pakistanis harbored overwhelmingly positive sentiments towards Iran. The lack of comprehension regarding the rationale behind this outrageous act is exacerbated by the fact that both countries are victims of terrorism, with terrorists exploiting the vast and rugged border terrain between them. Adding to the perplexity, the attack coincided with joint naval exercises between the Pakistani and Iranian navies, and a meeting between the Pakistani Caretaker Prime Minister and the Iranian Foreign Minister at Davos during the World Economic Forum. This context renders the attack even more absurd and challenging for Pakistanis to make sense of.\n\nDespite the ongoing collaborations, including joint mechanisms at multiple levels to address cross-border terrorism, Iran chose to bypass these arrangements and opted for a unilateral aggressive response. This decision resulted in the tragic death of two children and injuries to three other individuals. The stark contrast between diplomatic engagements and military provocations further underscores the need for a coherent approach to regional stability and cooperation between Iran and Pakistan.\n\nIran's recent military move stands out as a significant strategic blunder, failing to achieve even tactical objectives, let alone any broader strategic goals. The unfortunate casualties, including innocent children and an injured woman, point to a botched operation marked by questionable intelligence, raising serious doubts about the effectiveness of Iran's intelligence apparatus. This assessment gains credibility when examining Iran's actions in Syria and Iraq, where reports indicate that innocent civilians were targeted under the pretext of being associated with Israel's proxies.\n\nThe decision to test the waters with Pakistan, perhaps influenced by years of such offensive acts in Syria and Iraq, appears ill-conceived. Considering Pakistan's domestic political instability, Iran might have considered it as an ideal time for such action but, evidently, it underestimated the gravity of its actions. A rational assessment, rooted in one of the basic principles of International Relations to jealously guard state sovereignty, would have anticipated Pakistan's strong response. The aftermath has left Iran not only with international disgrace but also a rapid loss of significant soft power in Pakistan, underscoring the consequences of impulsive military actions in delicate regional dynamics.\n\nA pivotal aspect of the recent offensive by Iran is the significant precedent it establishes. This marks the first instance since the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s that a foreign nation has conducted an overt military operation within Iranian borders. Over the decades, Iran has perfected the strategy of engaging in sub-conventional warfare through its proxies in the Middle East. This has presented a dilemma for countries facing such warfare, as determining an appropriate response has proven challenging.\n\nIn response to Iran's strikes, Pakistan has effectively carried out its own military operations within Iranian territory. This not only reflects a tangible reaction but also opens a gateway for other countries in the region and potentially beyond. The externalities of this action could potentially inflict more harm on Iran than any benefits gained from the initial strikes inside Pakistan. The established precedent sets a new dynamic in the region, prompting a reconsideration of responses to sub-conventional warfare, thereby complicating Iran's strategic calculations.\n\nIran's trajectory as a potential nuclear state has been marred by persistent allegations of fostering proxies in the Middle East, contributing significantly to regional instability. The international community has responded with sanctions and reprimands, highlighting Iran's role in exacerbating chaos in the Middle East through armed militias under its influence. Now, in a concerning turn of events, Iran finds itself in direct confrontation with one of its nuclear-armed neighbors, a move seemingly undertaken without careful consideration. This stark reality raises serious doubts about Iran's standing as a responsible latent nuclear state, particularly as it may wish to inch closer to nuclear weapon status in the future.\n\nThe implications of this irrational move extend beyond the immediate conflict, casting a shadow over Iran's diplomatic relations with neighboring countries. The fallout may prompt not only Pakistan but also other nations in Iran's vicinity to reassess their frameworks of engagement with the country. The repercussions of this aggressive act have set Iran on a challenging path, requiring extensive efforts and time if it aims to rebuild and restore positive relations with its regional counterparts. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the delicate balance a potential nuclear state must maintain in international relations, with each action carrying far-reaching consequences.\n\nSafeguarding Sovereignty and Sending a Clear Message\n\nIn the aftermath of Iran's unprovoked attack, Pakistan's decisive kinetic response reflects a fundamental principle in modern international relations -- each state staunchly guards its sovereignty. The breach of Pakistan's sovereignty demanded a robust reaction, showcasing not only the country's capacity but also its unwavering will to protect its territorial integrity.\n\nBeyond the immediate necessity of defending sovereignty, Pakistan's response carries strategic implications. A failure to react could have set a detrimental precedent, particularly for neighboring countries like India, known for such provocations, especially in proximity to elections, as observed throughout the recent history of the Modi-led BJP government. The strikes within Iran send an unambiguous signal to any nation harboring ill intentions against Pakistan, emphasizing that such provocations will be met with resolute force.\n\nAn interesting dimension arises in the context of India's response. Despite attempting to distance itself by terming the situation as \"a matter between Iran and Pakistan,\" the Ministry of External Affairs subtly acknowledged understanding the actions taken in self-defense. This revelation gains significance when viewed against the backdrop of Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar's visit to Iran just a day before Iran's attack on Pakistan. The implicit suggestion of India's nod to these actions should prompt Iran to reconsider the incorporation of Indian influence in its calculations regarding Pakistan-Iran relations. This nuanced geopolitical dance raises questions about the evolving dynamics in the region and the potential implications for broader alliances and alignments.\n\nPakistan, in a strategic move, has effectively recalibrated the situation by launching a counterstrike within Iran. This calculated response takes into account the vast disparities in resources and capabilities between the two nations, emphasizing that Iran lacks the capacity to escalate the conflict further. Given this, it is prudent to consider this matter as largely concluded.\n\nThe sense prevailed\n\nAfter the retaliatory strikes in Iran, Pakistan demonstrated responsible action by promptly restoring diplomatic ties, a move that was met with positive reception from the Iranian side. This decision reflected the prudent stance of both nations, considering the irrational nature of hostilities within Iran-Pakistan relations. Recognizing the potential exploitation of the situation by various state and non-state actors, both governments acted wisely.\n\nSubsequent to the announcement, Iran's Foreign Minister, Hossein Amirabdollahian, arrived in Islamabad on January 29th to engage in extensive discussions with his Pakistani counterpart, Jalil Abbas Jilani. These talks were deemed necessary following the recent upheaval. Tehran and Islamabad are actively working to de-escalate tensions which is required for a long-term solution to the mutual cause of concern between both neighbourly countries.\n\nWay forward\n\nBoth Iran and Pakistan share the common menace of terrorism, making any unilateral act counterproductive in the fight against this shared threat. Moving forward, a comprehensive approach is imperative, necessitating joint efforts to secure their borders. This involves not only a surge in troops but also enhanced surveillance measures on both sides to prevent the exploitation of rugged terrain by non-state actors against either country.\n\nThe focus should shift from a reactive stance to proactive measures that foster regional stability. Collaborative border security initiatives can not only mitigate the risk of terrorist infiltrations but also serve as a foundation for building trust and cooperation between Iran and Pakistan. In an era where non-state actors pose a significant challenge, joint efforts become indispensable to safeguard the interests and security of both nations. This nuanced approach goes beyond military actions, delving into long-term strategies that strengthen the resilience of the region against common adversaries.\n\n[Pakistan Myanmar Locator map, by Hogweard, via Wikimedia Commons]\n\nAkash Shah works as a Research Officer at Strategic Vision Institute, Islamabad.

        "text": "Watan-The labor union of 11 Indian ports announced the refusal of its members to handle or unload any shipments of weapons destined to or coming from Israel. This decision came amidst reports of Indian drones being shipped to Tel Aviv amid the ongoing war waged by the occupying army on the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Indian National Union of Water Transport Workers, representing over 3,500 workers in 11 government-owned ports in India, stated in a release that it has decided to reject the loading or unloading of weapons shipments to or from Israel or any other country involved in supplying military equipment for war in Palestine.\n\n\"We, as port workers, a part of the labor unions, will always stand against war and the killing of innocents such as women and children,\" they added.\"The women and children have been torn to pieces in the war. Fathers couldn't recognize their children who were killed in explosions that were happening everywhere,\" according to \"Middle East Eye.\"\n\nNarendra Rao, the General Secretary of the Indian National Union of Water Transport Workers, stated that the union refused to participate in any actions that would increase the suffering of Palestinians.\n\n\"We have decided that if any ship carrying weapons or ammunition or any weapon consignment to Israel, we decided to boycott. We will not cooperate with that,\" he added.\n\nHe clarified that the union hasn't encountered any ships loaded with weapons heading to Israel yet, and the union's statement was intended to be a preventive measure as well as a solidarity action with Palestinians in light of the destruction in Gaza.\n\nThe Indian National Union of Water Transport Workers is a union organization in 11 major ports owned by the government in India, including 13 ports in total. They do not operate in the Mundra port, managed by the Adani Group, which holds the majority stake in a joint venture with Elbit Systems, Israel's largest military manufacturing company.\n\nThe union's action comes just a week after reports emerged that the occupying army received 20 Indian-made drones of the Hermes 900 model, routinely used in the war on Gaza.\n\nNeither the Israeli nor the Indian governments publicly acknowledged the deal.\n\nHowever, a source at Adani Group, which manages 12 minor ports in several states, confirmed to \"The Wire\" that the drones had made their way to Israel.\n\nHuman rights activists and defense analysts say this development further implicates India in the ongoing genocide of Palestinians unfolding in Gaza.\n\nOn February 7th, Indian news channel TV9 India reported that the drones, manufactured in Hyderabad, southern India, would aid in meeting \"Israel's needs in the war.\"\n\nIndia is the largest buyer of Israeli weapons, accounting for approximately 46% of Israel's total arms sales to the world. Indian companies also participate in producing many Israeli weapons in factories across India.\n\nUnder Prime Minister Narendra Modi, relations between India and Israel have grown, entering into a strategic partnership since 2018.",

        "title": "Death of a Russian Liberal Patriot",
        "text": "The world doesn't know all of the details about the death of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in an Arctic prison last Friday, and we may never know the full story of what happened to him that day. But U.S. President Joe Biden and other world leaders quickly blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for Navalny's death.\n\nA paradox exists in the reactions to his demise: on one level, it came as no surprise given previous attempts on Navalny's life and the long string of deaths of other Russian dissidents over the past few years. Still, the news set off shockwaves around the world, including at the Munich Security Conference, where Navalny's widow Yulia spoke just shortly after hearing of her husband's passing.\n\nNavalny's death should serve as a wakeup call for the struggle for freedom in the world -- and a reminder that this struggle starts here in rebuilding the vital center of America's politics at home.\n\nA Russian leader fighting for a different type of Russian nationalism and foreign policy\n\nLike most political leaders around the world, Navalny wasn't the same person at the end of his public life as he was when he started. He fought against an entrenched, corrupt dictatorship in his own country that has used brutal repression at home and prosecuted expansionist neo-imperialist wars abroad in places like Georgia, Ukraine, and Syria to maintain its grip on power. Towards the end of his life, Navalny worked to advance a new type of Russian nationalism not rooted in xenophobia or opposed to the international system.\n\nNavalny appeared to evolve as a person and in his career as a political leader, eventually sketching out a form of Russian liberal patriotism, in four areas of his work and life.\n\n1. Navalny fought against entrenched, corrupt elites. Starting out as an activist fighting overdevelopment in Moscow, Navalny soon targeted his efforts against state-run energy companies like Gazprom and Rosneft. He used his anti-corruption organization as a platform to expose graft and corruption, including allegations against Russia's top leaders -- including Russian President Vladimir Putin. This group helped Navalny build a network that was useful in organizing his 2013 campaign for Moscow mayor and his thwarted attempt to run for president in 2018.\n\n2. Navalny sought to build a broader coalition inside of Russia. Navalny was a Russian nationalist, but his views and positions on how to define that nationalism evolved substantially over the years, as Masha Gessen detailed in The New Yorker in 2021. Navalny staked out anti-immigrant positions earlier in his career and some criticized him as being out of touch with working-class Russians. But his worldview evolved towards a more liberal perspective, the more that he battled with the autocratic forces inside of Russia and came into more regular contact with liberal voices in Europe and America.\n\nIn an interview in Moscow in 2018, Navalny told Trudy Rubin of The Philadelphia Inquirer that \"his goal was to reach 'blue-collar youth, not hipsters, youth who see no future' and convince them that elections didn't have to be hopeless, and that grassroots resistance was possible.\" In that regard, he seemed to understand that a key to successful political change in Russia was found outside of the elite, university-educated elite voices and with ordinary, working-class Russians -- even if Navalny's movement never fully realized its potential with that sector.\n\nA previous attempt to murder him by Russian authorities in 2020 -- detailed in Navalny, the must-see documentary film released in 2022 -- pushed him further into the international spotlight and perhaps made him even more dependent on international support at the expense of sinking deeper roots inside of Russia. This may have made him a bit na\u00efve about the tough odds he faced, as some observers have noted. Part of the playbook of dictators these days is to push dissident voices into exile and then allege these figures are operating as agents for other countries.\n\nBut Navalny had the courage to face down these difficult odds and took a great risk in going back to Russia in 2021, offering inspiration to others who seek to continue the fight for freedom in the world.\n\n3. Navalny opposed Russia's wars of imperialism. He was strongly critical of Russia's 2015 military intervention in Syria, saying that Russia should be fighting with the anti-Islamic State coalition assembled by the United States instead of reinforcing the Assad regime. Navalny opposed and criticized Putin's decision to invade Ukraine again in 2022, although Navalny's relationship with Ukraine and statements about it over the years were much more complicated, as David Herszenhorn, author of the 2023 biography of Navalny The Dissident, pointed out. Bottom line: Navalny's worldview about Russia's foreign policy wasn't the retrograde, aggrieved perspective that currently fuels Russia's efforts to gnaw away at the international system like a termite.\n\n4. Navalny built a life and family outside of politics. One thing made clear in the 2022 documentary film as well as testimonials from friends who knew him is that Navalny also had passions and joys outside of his political career, including spending free time with his wife and two children and playing the video game Call of Duty. He had a legendary sense of humor that he deployed, including in his final court appearance. The political cause he adopted started to consume and ultimately took his life, but he still found the time and space in his life to have a life and family, an essential ingredient for building a healthier approach to political life, as The Liberal Patriot's John Halpin has advised.\n\nFinding meaning in the loss of Navalny to inform actions supporting global freedom\n\nNavalny's death serves as a vivid reminder that the true systems of repression and oppression use death and destruction to stay in power. According to Freedom House's most recent \"Freedom in the World\" report, the global tides of freedom have ebbed for 17 years in a row. Things haven't been getting much better during the past year, with flawed elections and armed conflicts among the key forces undercutting freedom around the world.\n\nDespite these negative trends, the global picture also offers some hope -- especially when compared to the past. These days, nearly double the number of countries in the world are free compared to when Freedom House issued the first edition of its global survey in 1973. Democratic countries like those in America, Europe, and Asia have shown remarkable resilience, capacity to course correct, and generate strong security and prosperity for their own peoples, even in tough times.\n\nThere are many legitimate worries about the health of America's democracy and rule of law these days, but the system still has some ability to uphold laws and impose costs for those who don't. Navalny's death came on the same day that a judge in America ordered former U.S. President Donald Trump to pay hundreds of millions of dollars and placed severe limits on Trump's ability to run his companies, the first of several civil and criminal cases the former president faces.\n\nIn thinking about Navalny's courage against daunting odds he faced in the fight for freedom in Russia, it is easy to become pessimistic, particularly when we look at some of our political leaders here in America. Too many political voices and analysts have become cynical and defeatist about America's role in advancing freedom in the world.\n\nOn some parts of the left, there's a \"blame America first\" mentality -- many of these voices are stuck in a past when the 2003 Iraq war was linked to a \"freedom agenda\" by President George W. Bush. On some parts of the right, there's more of a nativist, anti-internationalist, gated community mindset that likes to pretend as if America can wall itself off from the rest of the world. As a result, there are more voices who voice a knee-jerk rejectionism about America's engagement in the cause of freedom in the world.\n\nInternationalists supporting a liberal patriot approach to foreign policy should consider three big-picture steps that could help reconstitute an ambitious agenda to turn around the negative trends for freedom in the world.\n\n1. Rebuild the vital center in the domestic politics of stressed democracies to protect democracy and freedom at home and in the world. In the messy cacophony of politics in America and many leading democracies today, it is easy to lose sight of an important strategic vulnerability open societies have today: autocratic adversaries and rivals exploit these internal divisions for their own strategic advantage. The backsliding of democracy and freedom in the world directly affects America's political system at home, as autocratic and illiberal forces overseas use sharp power tools to exploit and sow divisions in our politics and amplify illiberal voices on the left and right.\n\nThe longer-term effort of rebuilding healthier and more constructive politics in America is part of the effort to revive a U.S. foreign policy approach that recenters freedom in the world. Most of this work will take place in how politics is conducted by political leaders, but there's an important debate over ideas and ideology amongst thinkers and analysts that needs to be had as well. For example, the hot mess that qualifies as American conservative thinking these days includes a strange love for Putin and Putinism in some right-wing quarters. In some corners of the extreme fringe left of America, voices criticize what they call U.S. imperialism and interventionism, yet all too often conveniently ignore Russia's very deadly interventionism and imperialism.\n\nThere's an important debate to be had over the battle of ideas, and this is a key part of rebuilding a vital center in America.\n\n2. Construct international coalitions among those working to rebuild the vital center in other stressed democracies. The challenges to an inclusive nationalism in America are present in other key countries around the world, including Britain, France, Italy, Israel, and India. Some have started to think about ways to reconstruct the vital center in their own politics in an effort to contest those extremist voices, as Yair Zivan wrote about Israel in these two articles for The Liberal Patriot before the horrific attacks by Hamas last October.\n\nThe struggle for freedom in the world is very much linked to the health of the democracies, and building a coalition across countries and set of conversations to counter what The Economist recently called the growing peril of national conservatism, as well as the illiberalism and isolationism found on parts of the left, is essential for the next stage in the fight for global freedom.\n\nThose working to rebuild the vital center in strained democracies should look for ways to exchange lessons learned with each other and put forward strategies to advance freedom in the world during this complicated geopolitical phrase characterized by political warfare that knows no borders.\n\n3. Support those fighting for freedom and liberalism in places like Ukraine, the Middle East, and Asia. This includes winning current wars in places like Ukraine and the Middle East in ways that advance the interests and values of the United States -- but that also includes preventing future wars through strong deterrence and engagement in the world in key parts of Asia like Taiwan.\n\nHelping Ukraine win and Putin's Russia lose will keep Americans safer. The second anniversary of Russia's attack against Ukraine coming later this week comes at a difficult moment in Ukraine's fight to defend itself against Russia's aggression, with Russia claiming more territory as some voices on the right and left in America call for passive appeasement.\n\nThe current logjam in the U.S. Congress in funding proposals to support America's partners in the world facing threats is a self-inflicted wound that will only inflict more damage to the cause of freedom in the world and democracy at home over time. The voices on the right parroting or trying to explain away presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's statement encouraging Russia to attack NATO allies, as well as those trying to deflect blame for House Republicans' inaction on immigration, are rooting for America's decline.\n\nThese three big-ticket items aren't going to be fully resolved in 2024, but the outcomes of the November elections will have huge implications for whether America will have the resolve and capacity to remain a leader in the fight for freedom in the world.\n\nNavalny took the ultimate risk in fighting for freedom in his own country, and sadly the same can't be said for many political leaders in the United States. But the best response to a difficult situation is to redouble the efforts to change it, rather than to give in. In the 2022 documentary bearing his last name, Navalny was asked what his message would be to his supporters if he died, and he said:\n\nListen, I've got something very obvious to tell you. You are not allowed to give up. If they decide to kill me, then it means we are incredibly strong. We need to utilize this power to not give up, to remember we are a huge power that is being oppressed by these bad dudes. We don't realize how strong we actually are. The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good people to do nothing. So don't be inactive.\n\nThe best way to honor the memory of Alexei Navalny and the ideals he fought for later in life is to defeat corrupt politicians in our own system and give as much support as we can to those fighting existential struggles for freedom in their own homelands.",

        "text": "US President Joe Biden in front of a portrait of Abraham Lincoln at the White House in Washington, US. File image/Reuters\n\nIn 2024, would America let down the world? Looking at the disorder and chaos of 2023, it seems more than ever that American global leadership is indispensable.\n\nNonetheless, every year commentators and pundits utter the same shibboleths: That the post-World War II global system, which the United States built and sustained with its economic, military, and soft power, is now breaking up amidst regional challenges, chaos, disorder, and strife; and not least, the rise of China, its global ambitions, and its alliance with an aggressive and authoritarian Russia under Vladimir Putin.\n\nApart from raging global conflicts multiplying and proliferating, there is the developing crisis of debt incurred by poor countries, the threat of climate catastrophe, the crisis in the Middle East, and the Ukraine-Russia lose-lose war stalemate. And then there's the danger that Donald Trump might return to the White House, which would create havoc not only in the US but also rattle the world.\n\nMany countries, especially in the Global South, are questioning whether Western values and rules of engagement have any relevance, especially when the world faces tremendous challenges of poverty, unending conflicts, pandemics, and climate disaster. The poor state of global governance, especially in Latin America and Africa, is leading to a massive immigration crisis not only on America's southern border but also in Europe, leading to right-wing populism in many countries.\n\nDespite the decline of its economy and demographic challenges, China remains a formidable political and economic power. Its role in global affairs in shaping economic, technological, and geopolitical issues must not be underestimated. The recent Taiwan elections that affirmed the Taiwanese people's determination to be free and maintain the political status quo have not pleased China's leaders. Nor have China's overarching ambitions for establishing its dominance in the South China Sea and the Indo-Pacific region been diminished anyway due to its economic slowdown.\n\nThen there's the Middle East sitting on a powder keg. The shock and awe of the horrendous attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7, which resulted in the vicious killing and taking hostages of hundreds of people, including women and children, led to the Israeli ferocious retaliation with bombardments and the invasion of Gaza, which brutalised the Palestinian people.\n\nThe initial overwhelming sympathy for the Israeli victims that the horrific Hamas attack had aroused globally began to dissipate because of the daily media showcasing of the suffering of the people of Gaza. While the Israeli hostages are still suffering in captivity in Gaza under the control of Hamas, the war has killed more than 25,000 Palestinians, including children, women, and the elderly in Gaza.\n\nThe conflict has spread to Lebanon, the West Bank, Syria, Iraq, and most notably Yemen, where the Houthi rebels, supported by Iran, have been blocking the vital Red Sea Suez Canal artery for global trade. The Iranian missile attack on Pakistan's Baluchistan region and Pakistan's tit-for-tat retaliation against Iran for war against terrorists' hideouts in each other's country forebodes illness and creates apprehensions that the conflict might get wider and more dangerous.\n\nRussia's war against Ukraine enters its third year, and the fear of a long-drawn-out conflict continues in the minds of policymakers in Europe, the US, and other major countries around the world. While Europe and NATO are doing their best to prop up and support Ukraine's war efforts, in the US, political parties are squabbling about how much to fund and how long to fund Ukraine in its fight against Russia.\n\nThere's a growing section of people in the US and elsewhere who believe that a partitioned Ukraine along the existing lines of actual control may be a feasible solution for ending the conflict and maybe a lesser evil. With the prospects of Trump returning to power, the question has become very crucial, especially because Trump has shown an inclination towards favouring Putin's Russia. He also thinks that Europe should take care of itself, questions the relevance of NATO, and believes that Ukraine is Europe's problem.\n\nAmidst the mounting geopolitical challenges, there is the rise of generative artificial intelligence. The rapidly evolving and complex landscape of artificial general intelligence presents both transformative opportunities and significant challenges. AI serves as a powerful tool for enhancing productivity, disseminating information, and aiding decision-making, while simultaneously posing a potential threat as a conduit for misinformation and disinformation, particularly in sensitive areas such as the forthcoming US presidential elections.\n\nThe pressing issues include responsibly harnessing the power of AI, understanding the implications of ongoing technological trends for politics, and safeguarding democratic integrity in a digital information-driven era. The expanding capabilities of AI, efforts to regulate the technology wisely, and the dangers that unregulated AI could pose to the integrity of information and democratic processes are all critical challenges.\n\nDespite the global gloom and doom and the threat of political chaos that Trump's legal battles, most notably the January 6 insurrection case, might create, the US economy has been booming. As the Economist wrote recently, \"From an array of hard data, there is reason to think that people ought to be quite satisfied about the state of the economy: inflation has slowed sharply, petrol prices are down, jobs are plentiful, incomes are rising, and the stock market is strong. But survey after survey suggests that Americans are, in fact, quite unhappy. They think that the economy is in bad shape and that President Joe Biden is mismanaging it.\" Politically dysfunctional America is economically vibrant, but the question is: Can the Titan hold up the world order it established after World War II?\n\nNarain Batra is the author of India In A New Key: Nehru To Modi_.

        "title": "How the world has changed with the war in Ukraine",
        "text": "On February 24, 2022 the world suddenly looked very different for generations of young Europeans, yet the reason why is as old as time itself. War had returned to the Old Continent, a place it had ravaged for centuries, and after 77 years of peace, almost no one remembered it.\n\nBefore long there were images of modern cities being bombed, endless columns of armored vehicles, masses of soldiers advancing, retreating, or digging trenches among the urban ruins and in the fortifications of the battlefields. There were massacres of civilians, subway stations and basements full of families, long lines of refugees, and bloody images of wounded and mutilated soldiers and civilians in hospitals.\n\nEurope has always had wars: three decades ago the Balkans were torn apart by interethnic clashes, and there has been fighting in Ukraine's Donbas region since 2014, but these conflicts have been limited and even contained. A new kind of hybrid warfare has emerged. The world has seen asymmetrical terrorist attacks, invasions of entire countries with hardly any resistance, systematic aerial bombardments, selective assassinations, and the counterinsurgency of occupying powers against local guerrillas.\n\nBut the novelty of old-fashioned warfare that returned in the early hours of February 24, 2022, was something different, yet it was familiar and unrecognizable at the same time. It was unreal. One might even say it came from films and television in a mixture of old and new images of horror. And that is because its return has occurred on the continent where the most wars in human history have been fought, and perhaps the only place where war lay completely forgotten and discarded as an instrument of conflict resolution.\n\nThe figure of the ancient and ferocious warrior monster has returned. The notable philosopher Raymond Aron used this image in his pioneering 1951 book The Century of Total War in his study of the 20th-century conflicts. It is a hyperbolic war, dominated by industry and technology, and involves entire societies. It puts civilians on the front line in a brutal existential clash between two countries that wastes lives, wealth, and even the future. And political leaders get caught up in a bloody auction in pursuit of victory at all costs.\n\nThe unexpected arrival of this specter has struck fear into the hearts of the vast majority of the European generations born in the peaceful post-war period. They had become accustomed to subletting the burden of security to the United States, benefitting from social protection in the form of a powerful welfare state, and enjoying peaceful trade that enabled them to build prosperous economies. Europeans enjoyed the good life and were completely oblivious to the tribute in blood that had been demanded of young people until 1945.\n\nPerhaps the war caught even those who summoned it by surprise, believing that they could limit the brutality of the invasion to a quick and easy technical-military operation to neutralize the Ukrainian army, overthrow Zelenskiy's government, and trade Ukrainian democracy for an authoritarian client regime. Conclusive proof of the surprise was seen in the hasty escapes made by hundreds of Russian oligarchs, Putin's associates and accomplices, scattered across the Western world in their yachts, estates, and luxury hotels. They were not aware of the magnitude and significance of the failures of the Kremlin's military plans and the sudden rupture of Russian globalization, which was punished by sanctions in response to the aggression.\n\nWar is the greatest and most brutal engine of change. Everything has changed -- Ukraine and Russia, the most. The regional order has also changed. Europe has woken up from its dream of stability. And so too has the world order. A war is the first domino that tips the others. International institutions are largely paralyzed, as is the case with the United Nations. The organization prohibits war and ensures peace -- unfortunately only on paper -- and its Security Council has been stymied for two years by Russia's veto of any measure or statement that affects its action in Ukraine.\n\nThe army of a nuclear superpower -- recognized as the largest in the world at least until the day of the invasion -- provided a terrible and disheartening example of what the political power of a country can do when it is willing to use force to resolve its political difficulties or disputes with its neighbors. It is the type of war defined by Aron as the organizer of international relations, since it involves \"the existence, creation, or destruction of states\", in this case Ukraine, or as in the case of Gaza, Israel, and Palestine.\n\nPrecisely because the idea of an international order governed by law and multilateral cooperation is the basis of the European Union, only scandal and repugnance could spark a war on EU territory. For Europe, though, it is not only a question of setting the limits of the EU and NATO and the scope of the hegemonies of Moscow and Brussels. Nor is it really about the two models of society and the two ideologies, one that is democratic and another that is authoritarian. The clash is between two conceptions of the international order, one based on diplomacy, negotiation, and institutions for the resolution of conflicts, and the other that only believes that the strongest imposes its will by force over reason. In the end, it is a war against the very idea of Europe as a space for cooperation, peace, and prosperity.\n\nIt is not only the European order that the war has upset, but the entire international order. For the last 30 years, the United States has had hegemony, following four decades of bipolarity during the Cold War between Moscow and the United States. Now there are several powers of different calibers, but they all have margins to frustrate the old hegemonies and impose their own conditions. The current multipolarity is a regression to the old, disordered world, which only knew some rules within sovereign countries. And these functioned, with limited and recent exceptions, according to the law of the jungle.\n\nThe phenomenon is ancient. Thucydides described it in his History of the Peloponnesian War, the first compendium of the cruelest political realism: the strong do what they want, and the weak do what they must. It is the same old story, but it is also a new story, because this war, like all wars, is also changing the way conflicts are fought. Superimposed on the sepia images that come to us from the ruins where once there were cities, there are now the destroyed bodies, the hypersonic missiles, the guided suicide drones, and the mobile phones of cyber warfare.\n\nThe technologies of death do not change, but rather accumulate and amalgamate under new forms. Russian troops advance or get stuck, in images that look like they were taken from the 20th century world wars. But a potentially more decisive, invisible war is being fought in parallel in cyberspace, using satellites, geolocation, artificial intelligence, bot farms, and hacking into the enemy's information systems.\n\nWhen the peaceful avenues of politics and diplomacy are exhausted, one party decides to take the middle path. It is the least certain way, but also the most effective in destroying the reality that it is trying to change. Instead, violence and chance will decide. Hence this bid in which each side throws everything they have at hand: their youth, their populations, and their resources. They dedicate themselves body and soul to destroying their adversary not only on the battlefield, but also at home, in the economy, supply lines, trade, and alliances, until there is nothing left to destroy.\n\nThe total war that has returned with giant strides is like those of the past but worse, because now it is also global. It is the first global war of the 21st century, with the ability to spread in the immediate environment and across the planet as a whole, due to the imbalance that it has unleashed on the precarious world order, and because of the new alignments and divisions that it causes in the world.\n\nPutin criticizes the Western nations that have coalesced around the United States as the enemy attacking Russia through the interposed force of Ukraine. A new anti-Western axis is taking shape between Moscow, Tehran, and Pyongyang, with Beijing approaching and then stepping back. Another party that has not aligned with the West or that appears to be in search of balance is the Global South. Countries like India, Indonesia, and Brazil are beginning to carry more weight in a future world order in which the United States and its partners will no longer be able to rule as they have until now.\n\nFor the moment at least, NATO has been strengthened. The mutual defence organisation has expanded with the addition of Finland and Sweden, and its doors are open to Ukraine. In this way Zelenskiy has already won his first victory over Putin, who invaded Ukraine to prevent that from happening. The war has also modified the European Union, which strenthened its area of chronic weakness. For the first time the EU has improvised financial mechanisms to provide weapons and ammunition to Kyiv. It has negotiated Ukraine's entry into the European family, and has included aid for the war-torn country of \u20ac50 billion (about $54 billion) in their strategic budgets for the next seven years.\n\nWar calls for war, with or without reason, especially when there is no longer a single superpower to prevent it. If Russia can unleash war against Ukraine, so can Azerbaijan against Armenia, and Israel against Gaza. It could even be Venezuela with Guyana, China with Taiwan, or North Korea with South Korea. Each war escalates on its own and constitutes a widespread danger of escalation. The interdependencies of globalization have changed meaning, in which security was tied to the prosperity of all, which have been converted into instruments of threat and even siege today.\n\nThe return of the warrior monster has called for an arms race and widespread rearmament, especially where investment in weapons had declined the most, as is the case in Europe. In these two years, stocks of weapons and ammunition have been exhausted. The call for investment by the manufacturers of death has been colossal. It is flourishing everywhere, and especially in dictatorships like Iran and North Korea, whose factories are making up for Russia's industrial weaknesses. But Europe's factories are also stepping up production, with governments alarmed by the isolationist reflex that drives the United States to abandon its transatlantic commitment, especially if Trump wins the presidential election this year.\n\nThe economic effects go beyond the military industry. They disrupt supply chains and increase prices. Famines threaten poor countries that depend on Ukrainian wheat, while rich countries can no longer rely on cheap energy from Russia. Civilians have been displaced en masse, sometimes due to the advances of one of the belligerents, and are turned into weapons of globalized war. The business is not only in weapons, but in any technology, product, or service. Just as there is an internet of things, now the there is a war of things: everything can be used as a weapon.\n\nThis global war unleashed by Putin is also an appeal to nuclear proliferation. Russia has invaded Ukraine under the protection of its atomic arsenal. Putin has wielded it on several occasions to intimidate Kyiv's allies and force a prudent and gradual supply of war material -- artillery, tanks, and aircraft above all -- and also limit the war to the territory of Ukraine. The value of the nuclear weapon, never deployed since 1945, lies in its use as an aggressive deterrent. The warrior monster is destroying the present, but at the same time is signaling its sinister intent to settle among us for a long time into the future.",

        "text": "The unexpected missile attack on a second India-bound ship carrying Russian crude, just three weeks after the first, has complicated matters for domestic refiners.\n\nIndia now counts the Vladimir Putin-led nation as its biggest oil supplier, according to Paris-based market intelligence agency Kpler, and these attacks come on top of US sanctions since December, where vessels that bring crude to India are facing heightened scrutiny.\n\nPanama-registered Pollux, which loaded crude at the Sheshkaris oil terminal in the Russian port of Novorossiysk on January 24, was scheduled to deliver the medium, sour Urals grade to Paradip port on February 28.\n\nAccording to United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations and the US State Department data, the tanker was struck northwest of Yemen's Mokha port in the Red Sea. The rebels had targeted the long-range 2 (LR2)-type tanker carrying around 628,000 barrels of Urals, with at least three missiles, and one had struck the vessel on the port side, according to a post by US Central Command (Centcom) on X (formerly Twitter). Officials then said there were no casualties, and the vessel had continued its trip to India's east coast. On Sunday, a Kpler official said the vessel had not transmitted a signal over the past day, likely due to being hit by a missile.\n\nState-owned refiner Indian Oil has a 300,000-barrels-per-day refinery at Paradip, with Russian state-owned Rosneft being the oil supplier, showed Kpler data.\n\nIf the attacks continue, Russian vessels may have to go around the Cape of Good Hope, increasing transit time by weeks and sending costs north, Indian refining officials said, expecting Moscow to intervene with Tehran to sort the issues.\n\nFor all cargo types, the decision to take longer and safer routes has resulted in higher trade costs for shipping and insurance, according to the UN Conference on Trade & Development (UNCTAD).\n\nThe incremental cost of diverting a tanker around Africa costs nearly $1million more per voyage. For an Aframax tanker, similar in size to an LR2, costs surged by 110 per cent, according to LSEG Shipping Research.\n\nA Mumbai-based refining official said there were no frantic calls from suppliers and no panic in the market on Saturday. Russian oil is still crossing the Suez, he added.\n\nThis was the second such attack in less than three weeks on a Russian oil vessel. Late last month, the Achilles, a crude oil tanker managed by India's Gaurik Ship Management, was sailing to Sikka on India's west coast carrying Russian Urals when it was attacked. The missile missed the vessel, and ship-tracking data showed that the cargo was delivered on February 1 at Jamnagar oil terminal.\n\n\"It is likely that the Houthis have no intention of attacking non-Israeli-related commercial shipping and that this was a one-off (incident),\" said Tilak Doshi, a London-based energy expert. \"It is not in their interest to do so, as their benefactors in Iran -- allied to Russia and China in global geopolitics -- do not gain by such actions either.\"\n\nThe Houthis continue to target Israeli-, American-, and British-linked shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. So far in February, they have targeted five vessels, including Pollux, according to UK-based Ambrey, a maritime security agency. Pollux had minor damage from the attack, Ambrey said.\n\nRussia has good relations with Iran and can manage the Iran-backed Houthi rebels, said a state-run refining official. Government officials said that India's support for Israel had turned the Hamas and the Houthis against India, a reason why they were targeting ships employing Indians and carrying goods to India. India has since tried to strike a balance in the Israel-Palestinian conflict.\n\nAn industry official said some tankers, including Russian, carrying crude to India via the Suez do not show their destination as India. But the Houthis are also looking at vessel ownership, and not just where they are headed, he added.\n\nAffiliations with mainland China, Iran, and Russia have not completely negated attacks either, Ambrey said, referring to attacks on Achilles and a container ship owned by a Chinese company.\n\nThe uncertainty is taking its toll on freight costs and insurance, which may make Russian oil uncompetitive unless Moscow absorbs the higher costs and maintains existing discounts of $3-4 per oil barrel, a state-run refining official said.\n\nIndia boosted its share of Russian crude imports to around 39 per cent of total purchases in 2023 from 16 per cent in 2022, despite warnings from Washington over potential sanctions violations. Imports averaged 1.53 million barrels per day (b/d) in January, and 1.58 million b/d in February till February 18, shows Kpler data. Imports have averaged around 1.5-1.6 million b/d since August after exceeding 2 million b/d in July owing to lower discounts, enhanced Western policing, output cuts by Russia and now the Red Sea conflict.\n\nWashington has stepped on the sanctions pedal since October, targeting vessels that carry Russian crude, trading over the $60 per barrel cap imposed by the G-7 group of nations. This has resulted in sanctions on Sun Ship Management in December and other entities in January and February. While India has no issues buying Russian oil, it will not accept such fuel transported on sanctioned vessels to Indian ports, officials said.\n\nSource: Business Standard",

        "title": "Indian Port Workers Refuse to Handle Israeli Weapons | Novara Media",
        "text": "Workers at Mundra port in the Indian state of Gujarat. Reuters\n\nAn Indian trade union representing more than 3,500 workers at 11 ports has called on its members to refuse to handle military equipment being sent to Israel amid the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nIn a statement from 14 February, the Water Transport Workers Federation of India said it will \"refuse to load or unload weaponised cargoes\" from Israel or any other country which could handle military equipment for the war in Palestine.\n\nThe union said that the port workers \"would always stand against the war and killing [of] innocent people like women and children.\"\n\nThe attack on Gaza by Israel had \"plunged thousands of Palestinians into immense suffering and loss,\" said the union, and that \"loading and unloading these weapons helps provide organisations with the ability to kill innocent people.\"\n\nIn refusing to handle weapons, the dockworkers join a growing list of workers heeding the call made on 16 October by Palestinian trade unions for the international labour movement to \"stop arming Israel.\"\n\nPrime minister Narenda Modi has shifted India towards an increasingly pro-Israeli stance, with the country among those that abstained on October's UN resolution for a \"humanitarian truce\" in Gaza.\n\nAccording to Workers in Palestine, an organisation formed by Palestinian trade unions, India is one of the \"foremost weapons importers\" of Israeli arms, importing an estimated $1bn worth of weapons every year. The \"growing arms trade\" between the two countries has \"intensified repression within India, particularly impacting the Muslim population.\"\n\nAdditionally, the production of vital components for Israel's major military companies have been outsourced to India, with publicly-owned companies like HAL and Bharat Electronics producing parts used in weapons by the Israeli military.\n\nIt's not only military cooperation between the two countries that has been strengthened. As Houthi attacks on commercial vessels passing through the Red Sea continue, Israel has been forced to seek out alternative supply routes.\n\nLast week, Israeli transport minister Miri Regev posted a video on X outlining a plan to bypass the Red Sea by transporting goods from India through the United Arab Emirates, along the Dubai-Saudi land corridor.\n\n\"We are now at the Mundra port, the largest port in India,\" Regev said. \"All these shipments go to the Emirates, and from the Emirates are transported by land to Israel.\"\n\n\"The state of Israel is like an island and all the goods arrive by sea. Unfortunately the Houthis took over the Red Sea and targeted ships which arrive to Israel. That's why we need an alternative supply route.\"\n\nWhile governments across the world have continued to provide military support and diplomatic cover for Israel, trade unions have sought to disrupt the shipment of arms and Israeli war effort.\n\n\"We need three things from the US: munitions, munitions, and munitions,\" the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a group of local government officials last December.\n\nIn Belgium, transport workers' unions ACV Puls, BTB, BBTK and ACV-Transcom issued a call last November to their members to refuse to handle military equipment being sent to Israel.\n\nThe same month, 1,200 stevedores at Barcelona's port represented by the Spanish OEPB union announced that they would refuse to handle any Israeli military equipment.\n\nAlso in November, dockworkers from the independent union Colletivo Autonomo Lavoratori Portuali took action at Italy's northern port of Genoa. Aided by students and community groups, the workers blockaded the San Benigno border checkpoint to stop the loading of cargo onto a boat operated by Israeli shipping line ZIM.\n\nIn the UK, both Elbit Systems and BAE Systems factories have been hit with blockades by protestors who oppose the use of UK arms in the current genocide against the Palestinian people.\n\nAlongside direct action, the labour movement has mobilised around the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement (BDS).\n\nIn the UK, the UCU has condemned the Universities Superannuation Scheme's (USS) refusal to review its investment links with Israel.\n\nThe USS told the UCU that it would continue to \"consider our legal duty to invest in the best financial interests of the scheme's members and beneficiaries.\"\n\nIn America, rank-and-file members of DC 37, a municipal union representing 239,000 City employees and retirees, are calling on New York City's largest public pension system to \"divest from all Israeli bonds and holdings in industries that fund and benefit from the ongoing violence in Palestine.\"",

        "title": "Inside WhatsApp Groups Of Housing Societies Where Muslim Hate Is Real | BOOM",
        "text": "Three years ago, 38-year-old Zee (name changed) was alarmed to see hateful messages inundate her Gurugram housing society's WhatsApp groups. Fueled by a section of mainstream media's focus on Tablighi Jamaat members as Covid spreaders in 2020, these messages triggered nightmares of her home being attacked.\n\nThe relentless onslaught of discriminatory messages took a toll on Zee's mental health, leading to a diagnosis of clinical depression. Faced with overwhelming fear and anxiety, she made the difficult decision to relocate from Sector 56 Gurugram to a densely populated, Muslim-dominated neighborhood in Delhi, seeking solace and a sense of safety amid the turmoil.\n\nWhen asked about the trigger for her decision to leave the society and move to a Muslim-dominated locality, Zee explained that while her mental health had been deteriorating over the years due to such messages, the final straw was a particularly alarming message: \"Get rid of the covid spreaders and not just the Covid.\" This message marked the onset of her nightmares, prompting her decision to move away a couple of months later.\n\nZee's experience is not isolated. Decode spoke to dozens of Muslims residing in cosmopolitan societies across Delhi NCR, Mumbai and other parts of India who echoed similar sentiments. They revealed that discriminatory and hateful messages against Muslims have become commonplace, circulating not only on random internet pages but also on housing societies' maintenance WhatsApp groups, as Zee's story exemplifies.\n\nDespite the lack of significant research or data to quantify the intensity and volume of such messages, the consensus among those interviewed underscores the pervasive nature of this issue. Many asserted that the intensity of these messages escalates with rises in Islamophobic narratives fueled by fake news or disinformation, as well as in instances where Muslim organisations are implicated in terrorist activities worldwide.\n\nMany of the people Decode interviewed said that there was a sharp rise in such messages last month on January 22, 2024, coinciding with the inauguration of the Ram Mandir on the demolished site of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya.\n\n40-year-old documentary filmmaker Abid (name changed), who lives in a housing society in Noida, told Decode that among those congratulating each other for the inauguration of the temple, the messages had a tone that took a dig towards Muslims for not being happy about the construction of the Ram Mandir.\n\n\"Even though there were messages loaded with a religious tenor, which should not be there in a society's WhatsApp group, there were also messages such as 'Please burn crackers with caution since there will not be a Burnol available in the market,'\" he said.\n\nAbid emphasised that the use of words like \"Burnol\" depicting a cream used against burns, was employed as a metaphor to imply that Muslims in the group would need to be kept in check on the occasion.\n\n\"We have internalized and accepted the religious messages and messages promoting right-wing Hindutva organizations. This does not impact us anymore, but messages like this, which particularly target us based on our political and religious views, leave trauma and have a reason to disturb us and make us feel insecure,\" he said.\n\nIn another society in the Viman Nagar area of Pune, a 48-year-old fashion designer Ambreen Khan (name changed) was astonished to come across a message in her society WhatsApp group that read, \"Everyone in the group should chant Jai Shri Raam to celebrate Ram Mandir, and those who do not do so are traitors to the nation.\"\n\nThe message triggered her so much that she started to worry about the security of her school-going daughter, who lives in the apartment with her.\n\n\"Even though someone within the group objected to that message and the message was subsequently deleted, the idea of someone inside the apartment group ready to label us as traitors was terrifying,\" she told Decode.\n\nAmbreen and Abid claim that these messages are circulated on a daily basis even if they are not directly targeting the Muslim community, and somehow these groups have become a breeding ground for a politics that has become synonymous with hatred towards a community.\n\n\"The intensity and volume of these messages are overwhelming. Almost daily, our housing society's WhatsApp group is inundated with members posting statuses like 'Jayte Jayte Hindu Rashtra' (long live Hindu Rashtra) and urging votes for certain leaders to ensure the prosperity of Hindus in the country. Although these messages don't directly target Muslims, their emotional impact on us is profound,\" said Abid. He said that the misuse of the housing society WhatsApp groups, which should ideally focus on maintenance issues, diverts from their intended purpose.\n\nThis recurring pattern was recounted by I. Rizvi, a 42-year-old teacher living in a residential society in Sector 121, Noida. Rizvi notes that every time there is a global incident involving Muslims attack by a Muslim organization anywhere in the world, there's a flurry of such messages in the WhatsApp group. Recently, following an attack by Hamas on Israel, the volume of such messages in these WhatsApp groups surged.\n\n\"Several messages were circulating in my society's WhatsApp groups on the day of the Hamas attack on Israelis. These messages directly or indirectly demeaned us, with some labeling Muslims as Jihadis living in the housing societies of Noida.\n\nOne message read, 'Many Jihadis have taken flats in the housing societies of Greater Noida. If Mossad could not stop them, what can our IB do?'\" Rizvi said.\n\nExpanding on the dynamics within the community, I. Rizvi who teaches at a university said, \"Given the disproportionate demographic representation, Muslims often find themselves in a significantly smaller minority.\"\n\nCommenting on the population of Muslims living in her locality, she claimed that there are hardly 30 Muslim families in comparison to some 600 non Muslim families in her society in Noida. However, she says that her society is considered to be one with a large Muslim population.\n\nWhen asked if they have considered leaving the WhatsApp groups that propagate such hate, I. Rizvi says, \"Leaving the group is no solution because it serves as an important medium for communicating about the maintenance issues of the societies.\"\n\nThe phenomenon sheds light on the interconnected nature of online discriminatory messages and the broader socio-political context. The surge in such messages during periods of heightened Islamophobic narratives underscores the influence that media trends and misinformation can have on shaping the tone and content of communication within these digital spaces.\n\nBOOM's analysis of all debunked fact-checks in 2023 revealed that Muslims as a community continued to be the primary target of mis/disinformation, mirroring the trend from the previous year. The community has consistently emerged as the primary target of fake news since 2021, per our analysis of the reports from the past two years.\n\nMax Kramer, a Germany-based researcher on digital communications, looks at these messages as the use of digital media for conspiratorial thinking. Kramer explained to Decode, \"As a researcher of digital communications, I would look at these conversations circulating inside a WhatsApp group along the lines of conspiracies and how conspirational thinking is enabled using digital capital to create fear around certain communities.\"\n\nHowever, these messages are not just confined to housing societies. WhatsApp groups of top management colleges like the Indian Institute of Management are also not spared by vitriolic hate.\n\nAn alumni of IIM Bangalore told Decode how he had to object to one such message in Hindi that translated to, \"Hindu whose blood does not boil is not blood but water; youth that does not serve Hindutva is useless.\" The message was in response to a video purportedly showing ministers from Karnataka going to watch the film Kashmir\n\nMany other people Decode spoke to complain about the trauma, fear, and at times decision to leave their societies and move to Muslim-dominated localities. Arif (name changed), a 42-year-old business owner residing in Jamia Nagar, a predominantly Muslim locality in Delhi, said that during the communal violence in Delhi in 2020, the proliferation of inflammatory messages became so intense that his wife began experiencing hallucinations, fearing an imminent attack. Consequently, they decided to relocate to a Muslim-majority area.\n\n\"The online space is rife with hate and fake news, but when observed from a distance, its impact is not as profound. However, when such messages circulate within WhatsApp groups of our local community, it poses an immediate threat. It's like hatred is brewing within the neighborhood. The fear and deteriorating mental health of my wife prompted us to leave our society in Faridabad and move to Jamia Nagar in Delhi,\" said Arif.\n\nArif recounted that his decision to leave the housing society in Faridabad was not easy, especially after the ordeal he had to face in getting a flat there owing to his Muslims identity.\n\n\"We really wanted to live in a cosmopolitan society and hence decided to move to Faridabad in 2017. Then I did not think that I would be desperate to move out of this cosmopolitan society as much as I was desperate to get into it,\" he said.\n\nThe house in Faridabad was found on rent after facing many rejections on account of him being a non vegetarian, a pretext often implying rejection for being Muslim.\n\nIn a conversation with Decode, Delhi-based sociologist Uzma Azhar Ali explained that these online trends mirror broader societal dynamics. \"The online space is increasingly employed as a tool to disseminate hate, often intertwined with larger political agendas,\" he said. Azhar Ali highlighted the emergence of imagined communities in the digital realm, drawing parallels with the pervasive otherization of communities at the societal level.\n\n\"Virtual spaces are not only reflecting existing prejudices but also actively contributing to the creation of divisive narratives. The online landscape becomes a breeding ground for the amplification of animosities, fostering an environment where the 'us versus them' mentality takes root. This, in turn, fuels real-world consequences, as seen in Arif's account of the communal violence prompting a physical relocation to escape the perceived threats in their neighborhood. The intertwining of online dynamics with tangible consequences underscores the urgency of addressing and mitigating the impact of hate and misinformation in digital spaces,\" Uzma explained.\n\nNevertheless, amidst the prevailing gloom, I. Rizvi asserts that instances exist where individuals from the majority community actively oppose these messages. They take a stand by calling out those who share such content within their respective groups.\n\n\"For instance, after the Hamas attack in Israel, when people were sharing hate messages, some individuals stood against such messages and called out those who were sharing them,\" Rizvi said.\n\n52-year-old Bhavna, who lives in the same locality as I. Rizvi and works as a communication consultant, has too often questioned majoritarian views on the group. When Muslims were called 'Jehadis' after the attack in Israel, she stepped in to call it plain fear-mongering based on fake news.\n\n\"My opposition to such messages stems from my values against hatred. While people can hold diverse political views and discuss them, fueling hatred against a community is simply unacceptable. Moreover, that's not the purpose of these societies' WhatsApp groups. They are meant to address everyday maintenance issues, not to engage in political and divisive conversations,\" Bhavna said.",

        "title": "Looking at the trauma of war through the mind of a wounded soldier",
        "text": "In a cold hospital room, Joe Bonham, a 19-year-old soldier, wakes up to his horrific physical reality -- his mangled body, trapped without limbs or the use of his eyes, ears, and mouth, placed on a stretcher. With an electric guitar, which acts as a headrest, he taps his head on the guitar strings in what we later find out to be morse code. What does he want to say?\n\nJohnny Got His Gun is a riveting performance by Helsinki-based theatre artists -- Johannes Holopainen, Essi Rossi and Pauli Riikonen -- who are currently on an India tour. The theatrical work has been adapted from American novelist Dalton Trumbo's acclaimed 1939 anti-war novel by the same name, which posed compelling questions on the necessity of war and the paradox of 'fighting for peace': What is peace that is gained by violence? What values are we upholding if we have to kill to defend them\u00ad? Can wars be fought for others?\n\nThe book is a powerful portrayal of the consequences of war through the lens of a severely wounded soldier. It was banned during World War II due to its highly provocative content, and surged into prominence during the anti-war movement around Vietnam. \"I came across Trumbo's book on my parents' bookshelf when I was 16 and was absolutely struck by it. Since then, I have always wanted to bring this to stage,\" says Rossi, who has directed the play.\n\nBut bringing this highly cerebral work to stage was challenging. One of the core challenges while making Johnny Got His Gun was to develop a script for a character, who has no way to communicate. Rossi had to wait another sixteen years before she could find the tools to do that. In 2013, she met Riikonen and Holopainen while studying theatre at the Academy of Fine Arts in the University of Helsinki, when she finally brought her idea to fruition. The trio collaborated to produce this piece in 2015. \"We just celebrated 9 years of Johnny Got His Gun right before we started our India tour,\" she says.\n\nAlso read: Why is a feminist gaze on Indian myths and legends important?\n\nThe book follows the protagonist for several years till he figures out a way to reach the world outside through morse code. \"We, however, decided to focus on that moment when he first makes contact with the world,\" adds Rossi.\n\nThis bridged the gap between the audience and Joe. In his mind Joe is free -- he has limbs, he can speak, he can tell his own story of the war. \"By giving him a voice and the use of his limbs we were able to explore his dreams and memories that are imprisoned in his head,\" she elaborates.\n\nHolopainen, the solo performer of Johnny Got His Gun, acts as a window between the audience and Joe's haunted mind -- he delivers a smattering of poignant monologues and enacts Joe's flashbacks from his childhood and youth, and hallucinations from the battlefield.\n\n\"Joe has much to say -- he is disillusioned by the war and he questions everything he has been taught about it\" says Holopainen about the show. \"In his head he wrestles with a hundred reasons that have been fed to him to take up arms -- liberty, democracy, the right to defend oneself against 'the other'.\"\n\nHolopainen's rich monologues are supported by powerful soundscapes. The sixty-minute show is punctuated with sounds from actual wars, iconic speeches by world leaders, and a constant refrain to Joe from taking up arms.\n\nSound designer Riikonen has included a spate of references from war history and popular culture to make the audience connect with the character. \"We have taken Joe out of his hospital bed in 1939 and brought him into the 21st century. The idea is to not just to support Joe's inner dialogue but also draw the audience's attention to what is going on around them,\" he says.\n\nAlso read: This year, focus on building your adversity quotient\n\nIt's sort of a collage of sounds that evoke images from the war -- sounds from the trenches, lines from Hollywood, and war propaganda. There are well-known public speeches as well -- from former US President George Bush's declaration on war against terror, former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's speech on the Faulkner Islands, and Russian President Vladimir Putin's on Ukraine. \"The strength of these soundscapes is that everyone has some association with them,\" he says.\n\nIn the last nine years, the Helsinki trio have been regularly updating the work with changing world politics. \"We want Joe to be a testimony of not just one war but of all the wars that are happening or will happen in the future,\" says Rossi. \"When we first made the piece, it was on the idea of pacifism as the war was a distant memory\". But today Finland stands at the juncture of war owing to its shared borders with Russia.\n\n\"In Finland, our parents are the last generation to face the consequences of war,\" says Rossi. \"Suddenly in the last few years the war in Ukraine has entered our living-room conversations again -- the question of going to war to defend ourselves is back on the table.\"\n\nThe performance was a part of Edinburgh Fringe 2022 where it received huge audiences, given the new context of war in Europe.\n\nIn a world that is increasingly belligerent and polarised on the issues of war, the show has become even more pertinent today. \"Maybe a few years ago it was easier to change the channel. But today these conversations have entered our homes and screens and you cannot mute them out,\" says Rossi, adding that their latest shows include reference to the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nJohnny Got His Gun's India tour has been initiated and produced by Pickle Factory Dance Foundation, with the participation of the Embassy of Finland in India. The Institut Francais in New Delhi is hosting the show on 20 February",

        "text": "For some time, it's been apparent that the world's nations are not meeting the growing challenges to human survival.\n\nA key challenge comes from modern war.\n\nOver the centuries, as military weapons have grown ever more destructive, war-related devastation has grown accordingly. World War II was the deadliest military conflict in human history, with an estimated 70-85 million people perishing from the war directly or through war-caused disease, famine, and other indirect factors.\n\nMost of the dead were civilians. In addition, many millions of people were wounded -- blinded, crippled, driven mad, or otherwise ravaged by the vast carnage. Large portions of the globe had become a charnel house, with the battered survivors left to desperately scavenge for food amid the burnt-out rubble and ruin.\n\nAlthough some scholars have pointed out that warfare has declined since then, and especially since the end of the Cold War, there was a sharp turnabout in 2022, when the wars in Ethiopia and Ukraine contributed to more battle-related deaths than in any year since 1994. By late 2023, Russia's military invasion of Ukraine alone had produced an estimated 315,000 killed or injured Russian troops, while the number of casualties among Ukrainian troops and civilians, though unknown, is certainly enormous.\n\nAmong these and the many other wars currently raging -- in Sudan, Myanmar, Ethiopia, the Sahel, and Syria, to name only a few -- the recent one in Gaza, with the fastest daily death rate of the 21 century, is particularly alarming, having already led to nearly 30,000 deaths and nearly 70,000 injuries.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's nuclear war, which emerged in 1945 with the utter annihilation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and which now has the capacity to end virtually all life on earth. Amid public threats from leaders of nuclear-armed nations to launch a nuclear war, the editors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists have set their \"Doomsday Clock\" at its closest ever to apocalypse.\n\nWar -- particularly nuclear war -- is probably the fastest way to extinguish the human race, but there are other crises underway that, on a longer-range basis, seem likely to accomplish the same task.\n\nThe most serious of these crises is environmental. In recent decades, there has been a rapid loss of biodiversity, with the sixth mass extinction of wildlife clearly accelerating.\n\nPollution has grown dramatically. This includes pollution of land and water caused by chemicals and by plastic (which takes 400 years to decompose) and of the air caused by industrial, motor vehicle, and other emissions (leading to an estimated 4.2 to 7 million human deaths annually).\n\nDamage to the soil, caused especially by use of toxic chemicals and other pollutants, as well as by deforestation, has become particularly severe. The United Nations has estimated that some 40 percent of the planet's soil is now degraded.\n\nA key element in the environmental collapse is the growing climate catastrophe, caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels. Melting icecaps and rising sea levels, unprecedented hurricanes, floods, and wildfires, and ocean acidification are all well underway.\n\nTogether with unsustainable farming practices, rising temperatures have produced growing food and water scarcity. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres declared that, unless immediate action is taken, there will be a \"global food emergency that could have long term impacts on hundreds of millions of adults and children.\"\n\nFurthermore, it is estimated that, by 2025, two-thirds of the world's people might face water shortages. Commenting on the deteriorating climate situation, Guterres declared gloomily in September 2023 that \"humanity has opened the gates to hell.\"\n\nThe rise of rightwing nationalism provides yet another challenge to human survival. In recent years, rightwing political movements -- headed by authoritarian demagogues such as Donald Trump (United States), Jair Bolsonaro (Brazil), Vladimir Putin (Russia), Narendra Modi (India), Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkey), Marine Le Pen (France), Benjamin Netanyahu (Israel), Viktor Orban (Hungary), and their counterparts in other lands -- have transformed the landscape of world politics.\n\nAppealing to xenophobia, militarism, racism, and religious prejudice, they have made great strides toward stirring up longstanding hatreds in their ruthless quest for power. A key to their success along these lines has been their call to revive the ostensible glory of their own nations by purging their internal enemies and triumphing over other, ostensibly inferior, countries abroad. Redolent of the fascist movements of the 1930s, this Radical Right approach portends worldwide turmoil, violence, and destruction.\n\nOf course, it might not be too late to head off these developments. After all, in the twentieth century, humanity did manage to defeat the drive of the rightwing maniacs who established fascist regimes and launched vast wars to rule the world.\n\nIn the aftermath of the chaos and destruction of World War II, humanity did manage to create the United Nations and to extend the range of international law. And, still later, as the planet stood on the brink of nuclear war, humanity did manage to roll back the nuclear menace and, for a time, halt the nuclear arms race and curb the prevalence of war.\n\nMoreover, there are a great many efforts underway -- by social movements and some far-sighted governments -- to address the contemporary crises. Peace, environmental, and political action movements have flourished and brought forth demands for sweeping changes in public policy. In addition, some social movements, recognizing the global nature of the problems facing humanity, have called for enhanced global governance to cope with the severe threats posed by war, environmental devastation, and violations of human rights.\n\nEven so, as the world once again veers toward destruction, it's clear that it's getting late -- very late -- to avert catastrophe.",

        "text": "NEW YORK: Amid the graphic images, fierce polemics and endless media criticism that have dominated my social media feeds since the war in Gaza began late last year, I noticed a seemingly bizarre sub-plot emerge: skin cancer in Israel. \"You are not Indigenous if your body cannot tolerate the area's climate,\" one such post read, highlighting outdated news coverage claiming that Israelis had unusually high rates of skin cancer. (They do not.) Skin cancer, these posts claimed, was proof that Israeli Jews were not native to the land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea but are in fact white Europeans with no ancestral connection to the region, enactors of one of the worst crimes of the modern age: settler colonialism.\n\nOn one level, the claims about skin cancer -- like similar ones about Israeli cuisine and surnames -- are silly social media talking points from keyboard warriors slinging hashtags, hyped up on theories of liberation based on memes of Frantz Fanon quotes taken out of context. In the context of the ongoing slaughter in Gaza -- more than 28,000 people dead, mostly women and children -- such posturing may seem trivial. But even, or maybe especially, at this moment, when things are so grim, the way we talk about liberation matters.\n\nAnd I find this kind of talk revealing of a larger trend on the left these days, emanating from important and complex theories in the academy but reflected in crude and reductive forms in the memes and slogans at pro-Palestine protests -- an increasingly rigid set of ideas about the interloping coloniser and the Indigenous colonised. In this analysis, there are two kinds of people: those who are native to a land and those who settle it, displacing the original inhabitants. Those identities are fixed, essential, eternal.\n\nI have spent much of my life and career living and working among formerly colonised peoples attempting to forge a path for themselves in the aftermath of empire. The rapacious carving up of much of the globe and the genocide and enslavement of millions of people by a handful of European powers for their own enrichment was the great crime of early modernity.\n\nThe icons who threw off the yoke of colonial oppression -- including Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah, India's Jawaharlal Nehru and Fanon -- were my childhood heroes, and they remain my intellectual lodestars. But I sometimes struggle to recognise their spirit and ideas in the way we talk about decolonisation today, with its emphasis on determining who is and who is not an Indigenous inhabitant of the lands known as Israel and Palestine.\n\nA good deal of the antipathy toward Israeli Jews today is undergirded and enabled, I believe, by something that to some ears sounds progressive: the idea that people and lands that have been colonised must be returned to their indigenous peoples and original state. But that belief, when taken literally, is at best a kind of left-wing originalism, a utopian politics that believes the past answers all the questions of the present. At worst it is a left-wing echo to the ancestral fantasies of the far right, in which who is allowed to live in which places is a question of the connection of one's blood to a particular patch of soil.\n\nImplicit in the emphasis on indigeneity is a promised restoration, albeit one of a very different sort from the imperial fantasies of Vladimir Putin or the gender obsessions of Ron DeSantis. Decolonisation \"is not converting Indigenous politics to a Western doctrine of liberation; it is not a philanthropic process of 'helping' the at-risk and alleviating suffering; it is not a generic term for struggle against oppressive conditions and outcomes,\" as the scholars Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang write in an influential academic paper published in 2012, \"Decolonisation Is Not a Metaphor.\"\n\n\"The broad umbrella of social justice may have room underneath for all of these efforts,\" Tuck and Yang write. \"By contrast, decolonisation specifically requires the repatriation of Indigenous land and life.\"\n\nThere is perhaps no more vexed question in the world than how this might play out in Israel and Palestine. There is no doubt that Palestinians long lived in the land that became Israel. Jews have deep historical roots in that land, but the vast majority of the people who established the state of Israel came from elsewhere, fleeing genocide and persecution in Europe and forced into exile by Middle Eastern and North African nations. It is impossible to separate Israel's birth from the dying gasps of the old colonial order. It was, in the indelible phrase of Arthur Koestler, \"one nation solemnly promised to a second nation the country of a third.\"\n\nIn theory, decolonisation includes the disestablishment of the very idea of land as property, of modern notions like nationhood and citizenship. In theory, it is a chance to do it all over and replay history with the benefit of indigenous ideas and traditions to guide us.\n\nBut history doesn't work that way. People do bad things. Other people resist those bad things. Humans invent and discover; they create and destroy. There is no going backward to some mythic state. There is no restoration. The events that unfold over time shape the land and the people who live on it, and those people shape one another in manifold ways, some brutal and destructive, some generative and loving. But time and experience ensure that nothing can ever be the same as it was before the last thing that happened.\n\nAs I was thinking through these issues, I came across a series of social media posts about settler colonialism by Iyad el-Baghdadi, a Palestinian writer and activist whose work has been an indispensable guide for me in the present crisis. I sent him an email, and he agreed to speak with me to expand on his ideas. I explained my unease at the reliance on concepts like indigeneity to decide who has a just claim to live in a place.\n\n\"Don't take these people seriously,\" he told me, though he made clear that he has some sympathy for those who espouse such views. \"They're not really motivated by some kind of ideology. They're really motivated by emotion and they kind of slap together an ideology to satisfy their emotion, but then emotions by their very nature cannot be satisfied that way.\" He told me that sometimes when he hears people talk about Palestinian liberation it is almost like they are expecting a literal reversal of 1948, what Palestinians call the \"nakba,\" or catastrophe, of their expulsion upon the founding of the state of Israel.\n\n\"It is as if there will be this magical moment and all our villages are going to appear out of the earth. And then 75 years of settler colonialism is going to disappear,\" he said. \"But this romantic idea is really unmourned trauma.\"",

Bharatiya Kisan Union (Sidhupur) leader Jagjit Singh Dallewal said they discussed at length the Centre's proposal, which was offered during a meeting between the protesting farmer leaders and three Union ministers Sunday night, and concluded that it was \"not in favour\" of the farmers. Piyush Goyal, Arjun Munda and Nityanand Rai participated in the meeting with the farmer leaders along with Punjab CM.\n\nIn other news: The National Commission for Women chairperson Monday said she had received 18 complaints from the women of West Bengal's Sandeshkhali, including two of rape, during a visit to the area. The chairperson, Rekha Sharma, also demanded the President's Rule in the area and the resignation of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for \"failing to stop atrocities on women\". The state police, meanwhile, arrested a TV journalist who was reporting from the area, prompting a sharp reaction from the BJP. The area has been at the centre of a political firestorm between the TMC and BJP ever since protests broke out in the area earlier this month.\n\nThe Army is converting its Headquarters Uttar Bharat (HQ UB) area into a full-fledged operational corps -- a move that will shift its focus towards operations along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) from its current responsibility of peacetime duties, The Indian Express has learnt. Based in Bareilly, the HQ UB area is currently a static formation looking after peacetime locations and training establishments of Uttarakhand and western Uttar Pradesh, in addition to the LAC running along Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand -- also referred to as the central theatre. A corps comprises elements of all arms and services with adequate reserves to carry out operations in its area of responsibility.\n\nAn Amnesty window opened for just six months in March 2017 to clear projects in a novel \"violation category\" became routine through a Union Environment Ministry notification in July 2021, and provided ex-post facto approval to over 100 projects till the Supreme Court stayed the notification in January this year. Projects that started work without obtaining a mandatory prior environmental clearance or exceeded the limits set as clearance conditions fall under the \"violation category\". Besides clearing over 100 projects, the ministry also issued terms of reference (ToR) for impact assessment to at least another 150 (see chart) under the violation category.\n\nIn top international news: The United States has proposed a rival draft United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a temporary ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war and opposing a major ground offensive by its ally Israel in Rafah, according to the text seen by Reuters. The move comes after the US signalled it would veto on Tuesday an Algerian-drafted resolution -- demanding an immediate humanitarian ceasefire -- over concerns it could jeopardise talks between the US, Egypt, Israel and Qatar that seek to broker a pause in the war and the release of hostages held by Hamas. Until now, Washington has been averse to the word ceasefire in any UN action on the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nIn news from Sri Lanka: Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe said on Monday that his government has initiated the process to uphold the economic and social rights of the country's minority Tamil community as he expressed gratitude for India's support for a housing project in the island nation. Wickremesinghe virtually launched the 4th stage of the Indian Housing project, 'Bharat- Lanka,' aimed at constructing 10,000 houses with Indian grant assistance for plantation sector workers in Sri Lanka. Indian High Commissioner Santosh Jha joined President Wickremesinghe in virtually unveiling the foundation stone plaque for 1,300 houses across 45 plantation estates in ten districts.\n\nIn news from Pakistan: Reversing its earlier decision, jailed former prime minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf on Monday said that the party-backed independent candidates, who won the February 8 elections, will join the right-wing Sunni Ittehad Council. The party had earlier decided that its members elected to the National Assembly and the Punjab provincial assembly would join Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM), a Shia party, while those elected in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) would become part of Jamaati-e-Islami (JI), which is a hardline Sunni religious party. The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) is an alliance of Islamic political and religious parties in the Muslim-majority country which represents followers of the school of Sunni Islam.",

Israel has said that it will launch an offensive in Rafah in southern Gaza if Hamas does not release the hostages it holds in the next 10 days. Reports suggest that over 29,000 Palestinians have already been killed in the conflict. For civilians fleeing Gaza, Rafah is the last refuge -- its population has grown by over six times since October 7. An offensive here would be catastrophic for the refugees. It is indeed time for Israel to listen to its friends -- including India.\n\nOn Saturday, for the first time since Hamas's horrific attack and Israel's devastating response, Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said that Israel should be \"mindful of civilian casualties\". As he reiterated India's unequivocal condemnation of the October 7 attacks, he also underscored the urgency of a humanitarian corridor in Gaza and the long-term need for a two-state solution. Jaishankar also framed Israel's responsibility towards the principles of international law. The gist of his words and the three PMs' letter is this: Palestinian civilians must not continue to pay the price for the actions of the extremist wing of Hamas. Equally, a ceasefire cannot be one-sided -- it will require Hamas to stop its violent actions. International pressure will have teeth and be far more effective, however, if it is championed by Israel's closest ally.",

        "text": "A group of South Asian men arrived on our doorstep seeking shelter, seeking a place to be made welcome, seeking safety and security. We don't know why they left their homelands, but they undertook a dangerous journey, finding their way from Bangladesh, Pakistan and India to Indonesia to board small, overcrowded boats and sail across to the northwest of Western Australia.\n\nWe don't know what drove those men to leave their homelands, but to leave is never easy, the decisions usually are to escape one sort of tyranny or another, whether it be religious persecution or some other form of intolerance which is life threatening, racial difference, sexual orientation, or the consequences of natural disasters, but whatever the reason, they now find themselves on Nauru effectively imprisoned for an indeterminate period of time while various checks are made to determine who they are and whether their claim to seek asylum is legitimate, but are promised that they will never be settled in Australia.\n\nThey join a multitude of other stateless people, adrift in the uncertainty of having no home to go back to and no place for them to go to. According to the documentary film Human Flow made in 2017 by the Chinese artist and activist Ai WeiWei, about 68million people in search of a home, somewhere, anywhere as they have fled wars, famine, persecution and a life that the only certainty appeared to be death either through starvation or violence or imprisonment for daring to speak out on political differences. According to UNHCR that number has grown to over 110 million in 2023. That is about 1.375% of the world's population are displaced for any number of reasons. (To make that number seem more real, that is more than 13 people out of every thousand, worldwide.)\n\nIncluded in that number are internally displaced people who are not defined as refugees but have fled their homelands because of desertification due to climate change, flooding of regions to build dams to gain water security, rising sea levels or other environmental issues which have made the homelands uninhabitable.\n\nThese people, seeking somewhere to live are not criminal, they are not illegal, terms which seem to be flung around when defining refugees or asylum seekers, whether they arrive here by plane or boat. Many, according to the Australian Red Cross arrive here with a valid visa, as visitors, and then make claims for asylum. Neither is it illegal to enter a foreign country without visa, passport or other papers when seeking asylum. So the treatment of asylum seekers in Australia, effectively as criminals is not in accordance with the UN Declaration of Human Rights, to which we as a nation are signatories to. Article 14 affords the right to asylum in other countries from persecution.\n\nWe have politicised and effectively criminalised those who are some of the most desperate and disadvantaged people in the world and deny them the basic human rights as defined by that declaration which we are obliged to uphold.\n\nAnd yes, we do have the right, in fact the obligation to confirm that the asylum seeker has a legitimate claim to asylum, and we can restrict their movements during the period of validating that claim. The wording of Article 14 stipulates that the right to seek and enjoy other countries asylum from persecution \"may be invoked in the case of prosecutions genuinely arising from non-political crimes or acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.\" That does acknowledge that not all claims are legitimate and that at times criminals do try to get in 'through the back door', but the safeguards are there to ensure that those who are not legitimate refugees can be sanctioned, deported, returned to face justice from the place they have fled.\n\nListening to the political debate on refugees and asylum seekers, one could be forgiven for thinking that we have a severe problem.\n\nWe don't.\n\nThe nations hosting the most refugees are Iran, Turkey, Germany, Pakistan, Uganda, Russian Federation, Poland, Bangladesh, Sudan, Ethiopia, Lebanon... and Australia does not even appear on that listing from stastista.com. Iran according to UNHCR for over 40 years has been host \"to the largest and most protracted urban refugees in the world and has provided asylum to refugees for over four decades.\" Iran currently hosts over 3.4million refugees and asylum seekers. The small nation of Lebanon, almost half a million refugees, many dating back to the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Palestine/Israel.\n\nWhy are we afraid of showing some humanity? Fear of these strange, desperate people drives the political argument, but when I look at our history as a nation, we are an immigrant nation. Starting 236 years ago were undesirables from Britain, prisoners and their guards, followed by wave after wave of settlers and more convicts, after both world wars more immigrants seeking a new life away from wore torn Europe settled here, developing this nation to be at that time an essentially European nation but that changed in the 1970s when we welcomed people from all over the globe. After the Vietnam war we welcomed more boat people, Vietnamese escaping from the re-education camps of the winners of that conflict or the repression of those who had sided with the losing side, and with each successive wave of immigrants we saw new economies flourish, rather than being a burden on this country, these immigrants all have made great contributions to Australia, cultural diversity, new businesses, each wave adding to the economic and cultural development of Australia.\n\nThe reality is that each of us who does not claim First Nations status is an immigrant or can trace their ancestry to another country at the most ten generations ago, each of us have either arrived as immigrants, leaving our birth countries, or our parents, grandparents or great grand parents did, for reasons not dissimilar to those who arrive here, whether through the airport carrying a visitor's visa or through unofficial channels, arriving by boat at great risk to escape whatever the threats and dangers of their homelands.\n\nDiane Armstrong in her book The Voyage of Their Life, records the lives of over five hundred people who arrived in Australia in 1948 on a poorly prepared, dangerously inadequate ship, the SS Derna, and interviewed many of them fifty years later, recording the lives they have created in their new country, many are success stories, business people who have made significant economic contributions, others in the social and political spheres, from people who settled in all parts of Australia, from Western Australia to Far North Queensland, in other words like any other immigrant, arriving, seeking a better life for themselves and the families they formed.",

        "title": "Does the US Army's future lie in Europe or Asia?",
        "text": "T was a pivotal one for America's army. The force was battered and broken from Vietnam. In January the defence secretary announced the end of conscription; two months later the last combat troops left Vietnam. But the Arab-Israeli war which broke out on Yom Kippur in October planted the seeds of renewal. The lessons of that war, absorbed by American officers dispatched to Israel, helped reshape the Army into the modern and professional force which would vanquish Iraq in 1991.\n\nToday's generals, who came of age during that transformation, are keenly aware of the resonance. \"There's a loose analogy between the early 1970s and the army of Desert Storm,\" says General James Rainey, who leads the army's Future Command, \"and the army which invaded Iraq in the early 2000s and where we need to be in 2040.\" Two decades of war in Afghanistan and Iraq wore out troops, equipment and ideas. A recruitment shortage remains unresolved. Now the rise of China and the lessons from the war in Ukraine have prompted introspection, renewal and reform.\n\nAmong army civilian and military leaders there are three big unsettled questions, according to people familiar with those debates. One is whether profound shifts in the character of war, some evident in Ukraine, might render ground forces less important, if not irrelevant.\n\nA second is how to balance resources between Asia and Europe (Asia being the Pentagon's priority and Europe where Russia is rearming fast). The army can prepare for conflicts in both places but it cannot actually wage those wars at the same time -- and it is no longer asked to do so. The 2018 National Defence Strategy ended the \"two war\" standard, a change accepted by the Biden administration.\n\nThat leads to a third, and the most existential for the army. What, beyond the provision of logistics and air defence, would be the role of a ground force in a future war in the Pacific?\n\nWhen General Randy George, the army's chief of staff, was recently asked for book recommendations, he cited \"The Arms of the Future\" by Jack Watling, a young British analyst. The book describes how in recent rounds of Warfighter, a big annual exercise led by America, combat brigades facing increasingly good sensors and longer-ranged and deadlier munitions take huge losses, emerging with 20% combat effectiveness. Artillery devastates infantry and armour well before they can get within sight of the enemy.\n\nThe war in Ukraine has reinforced those findings. Some argue that the Army, better trained and armed than Ukraine's, and with air cover above, would fare better. General Rainey nonetheless assumes the worst. \"We're going to fight under constant observation,\" says General Rainey, \"and in constant contact of some form. There is no break. There is no sanctuary.\" He says that American \"lessons learned\" teams were in place three days before the invasion to collect observations. They will have had some nasty surprises: American-made -guided shells and rockets initially worked well; more recently, they have struggled against Russian jamming.\n\nThe army recognises that where it could once patiently muster its forces before launching a large-scale offensive -- as it did against Iraq in 1991 and 2003 -- it now has to prioritise dispersal, mobility and concealment. The drone attack which killed three soldiers in Jordan on January 28th was the first successful attack on American troops by aircraft since the Korean war. Katie Crombe, an army officer, and John Nagl, a professor at the Army War College in Pennsylvania, point out in a recent paper that Ukraine's battalion command posts comprise seven soldiers who dig into the ground and move twice daily. \"That standard\", they warn, pointing to ingrained habits of hardened command posts, \"will be hard for the Army to achieve.\"\n\nThe commanders of battalions (about 1,000 soldiers) and brigades (a few thousand), the core units of combat in Afghanistan and Iraq, would be consumed by this intense fighting in a way they were not during counterinsurgency missions. The army is thus reorganising so that more of the burden of planning, logistics, command and control and long-range firepower falls on divisions -- larger formations typically led by two-star generals which stand farther back from the front lines and have more time and space to orchestrate the frenetic battles of the future.\n\nWhat remains unsettled, says Billy Fabian, a former infantry officer and Pentagon planner, is how, precisely, the army's combat forces should be organised for future wars: the balance between firepower on the one hand, dominant in Ukraine, and so-called manoeuvre elements, such as infantry and armour, on the other. \"Fighting land wars is the army's raison d'\u00eatre,\" he says, \"and Ukraine raises tough questions that challenge deeply ingrained elements core to the army's self-conception.\"\n\nHanging over these reforms is the larger question of where the army will be asked to fight. National defence strategies published by the Trump and Biden administrations instruct the Pentagon to focus on China. In fact, the army grew its footprint in Europe after Russia's first invasion of Ukraine in 2014. It has since reinforced the continent with a corps and division headquarters, an infantry and armour brigade, a rocket artillery battalion and numerous other support forces. In contrast, relatively few new forces have flowed into Asia.\n\nFor many years, the Army's principal role in the Pacific was to guard bases, provide air defence and handle logistics. To the extent it was a \"manoeuvre\" force, in military parlance, it was focused on North Korea. Other services have looked down their noses at it. \"The navy has a stranglehold on the leadership of Indo-Pacific Command,\" says Stacie Pettyjohn of the Centre for a New American Security, a think-tank in Washington. \"They see the army only in a supporting role in a maritime theatre.\"\n\nGeneral Charles Flynn, the commander of the Army Pacific, vigorously rebuts such ideas, speaking to The Economist in his headquarters in Hawaii. \"Humans have this unique tendency to live on land,\" he says. \"At the end of the day, decisions are going to be made by the pointy end of a gun.\" The primacy of land is as true in Asia as it is in Europe, he argues, not least because the region's largest countries, like India and Indonesia, have military forces dominated by armies. The idea is that, by building ties to them in peacetime, the army can position itself to project military power westward.\n\nThe growing pace of exercises (more than 40 take place annually) is a core part of that. General Flynn points to the examples of Talisman Sabre in Australia and Garuda Shield in Indonesia. Both were once relatively modest army-to-army exercises. They have grown and now involve the navy and air force. Both also involved the army's Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center (), in essence physical and virtual training equipment that can be deployed around the region to do things which could only have been done at a large base in Louisiana. Such drills are morphing into a near-permanent presence: the army is deployed in the region for eight months of the year.\n\nAlongside that is a reimagining of how the army would fight. The premise is that China has optimised its forces to attack American satellites, ships and air bases. \"What it's not designed against\", says General Bernard Harrington, \"is to find, fix and finish land formations that are distributed, mobile and networked.\" That has prompted the creation of three experimental \"multi-domain task forces\", or s, the first of which is focused on Asia and commanded by General Harrington.\n\nEach has four battalions which can deploy small units along the first island chain which runs from Japan to the Philippines. The idea is that these can fight not just on land -- soldier v soldier, tank v tank -- but across domains. Imagine that America needs to target a Chinese ship. The 's \"effects\" battalion might jam its radar and hack its networks; if that does not neutralise the ship, it makes it more likely that anti-ship missiles launched by a \"fires\" battalion will get through. The force's long-range hypersonic missiles, which arrived last year, have a range just short of 3,000km -- enough to reach from Japan to Taiwan, or from the Philippines to the South China Sea.\n\nInitial experiments with the s have shown promise, though some are sceptical that this high-tech vision of war would survive contact with reality. They have also yielded useful lessons. General Harrington says that an exercise in the Philippines last year was a reminder that rocket launchers and intelligence equipment, full of delicate electronics, fare less well in the heat and humidity of tropical Asia than in the American proving ground where they were first tested. Two s are currently devoted to Asia, with a third for Europe. The original plan envisioned a total five, with an additional one in the Arctic and one for global tasks.\n\nAll this would seem to offer a definitive answer to the army's identity crisis: Asia first. Inside the Department of the Army, nestled within the Pentagon, there are doubts, though. One question is whether its own plans mesh with those of the armed services as a whole. \"The army still feels marginalised in the Pacific,\" says Ms Pettyjohn. Another is whether the army itself has pivoted ruthlessly enough. Its fleet of watercraft has shrunk dramatically in recent years, for instance. \"Watercraft are an absolute indicator of true commitment to the Pacific,\" says J.P. Clark, another Army War College professor. \"They are quite expensive, only really useful for that theatre, and absolutely essential.\"\n\nThe s themselves remain \"niche\" formations, argues Mr Fabian. The largest formation allocated to the region is the 25th Infantry Division in Hawaii, he points out, a light-infantry division. \"It seems like the Army is trying to have it both ways,\" argues Mr Fabian. \"Talk about fires and air defence for the Pacific, but stay a combined-arms force organised for close combat like it's always been.\" The army hedges its bets, says an insider, because it rarely wages the war it expects.\n\nTrade-offs abound. Short-range artillery is vital for Europe; less so in Asia. \"I just don't know what you'd fire a 155-round at out in the Pacific other than the water,\" quipped a top Pentagon official recently. The army will have to make firm choices in the next year or two, say officials. In part that is because it is creating more units than it can reliably man. The army expected to finish last year short of 10,000 recruits, a 15% shortfall and the second consecutive year of under-enlistment. Much of that is down to America's tight labour market but it also reflects waning enthusiasm towards military service, and towards combat arms in particular.\n\nThe fall in the size of the \"individual ready reserve\" -- reservists not allocated to a particular unit -- from 450,000 in 1994 to 76,000 in 2018 worsens the problem. Ukraine shows how intense wars tend to chew up regular armies, requiring an infusion of citizens with military experience. Today's shortage of combat soldiers is tomorrow's shortage of reservists. Ms Crombe and Mr Nagl are among those who favour the notion of \"partial conscription\", an idea backed by just 20% of Americans. Now, as in the pivotal moments of the mid-1970s, the army finds itself wrestling with profound questions over its size, shape and purpose, ones that will eventually touch, as they did then, its relationship to American society. \u25a0",

Significantly, India's external affairs minister made India's position on Palestinian statehood clearer at the conference, besides holding talks with other global leaders\n\nIndian External Affairs Minister, S Jaishankar has called for a 'permanent fix' to the Israel-Palestine conflict. In his speech at the Munich Security Conference (MSC) 2024, Jaishankar stated that a large number of nations, particularly those in the Global South, believe that terrorism shouldn't be justified.\n\nThough calling Hamas' attack on Israel on 7 October, an act of terrorism, EAM Jaishankar said that Israel should have been \"very mindful\" of civilian casualties in its response and emphasised its \"obligation to observe international humanitarian law.\"\n\nHe also outlined key dimensions of the Israel-Palestine conflict so as to have a long term and a permanent solution to the issue.\n\nJaishankar's latest speech stresses two points that India, as the PM noted in his first reaction, after the 7 October attacks, emphasises that the Hamas' attacks were a \"terrorist attack\", yet it has further reiterated its age-old stand that the solution to the Palestinian issue, could be found only through a two stage solution.\n\nHowever, the outlines of any such \"two state solution\" is yet to be defined and by the time the international comity agrees to those parameters, a lot of innocent Palestinians would have been killed in the on-going Israeli attacks.\n\nWhat is of paramount importance here is an immediate cessation of hostilities by the IDF, and an ensured flow of humanitarian aid to the besieged Palestinians.\n\nIn his speech EAM, also praised the efforts by the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, but Blinken on his part said that the US is committed to Israel's security and supports the proposition that Israel has to find ways to ensure that whatever happened on 7 October \"never happens again.\" This underlies the continued American support to the Bibi regime in Israel and till the time this monetary and military support is not halted by the US, signs of the war ending immediately are very slim.\n\nIn his speech, Jaishankar also stated that a large number of nations, particularly those in the Global South, believe that terrorism shouldn't be justified. He said that these nations believe a two-state solution should not be delayed.\n\n\"I think a very large number of countries, especially those in the Global South, believe that terrorism shouldn't be countenanced or justified. But they equally strongly believe that a two-state solution should not be delayed. These are not choices. These are both musts. And unless we are able to address both these issues, we are not going to really solve the problem,\" EAM said.\n\nAt the conference, Jaishankar also met with his Saudi Arabian counterpart Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud and discussed the West Asia situation and the strategic partnership between India and Saudi Arabia.\n\nNotably, India and Saudi Arabia share centuries old economic and socio-cultural ties. Economic ties are an important aspect of the bilateral strategic partnership between two nations, according to the Indian Embassy in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIf however, India and Saudi Arabia share the same page on the Palestinian issue, then it seems plausible that the war may end soon in Palestine. As Saudi is one of the prominent Middle Eastern nations, who are pursuing diplomatic efforts to get the conflict, ended as soon as possible.\n\nMeanwhile, there are reports that Russia has invited various Palestinian factions to meet in Moscow on 26 February, the Palestinian Authority prime minister said on Sunday, adding that the PA was ready to engage with Hamas.\n\n\"Russia has invited all Palestinian factions who will be meeting on the 26 of this month in Moscow. We will see if Hamas is ready to come to the ground with us\" Mohammad Shtayyeh told the Munich Security Conference.\n\n\"We are ready to engage. If Hamas is not then that's a different story. We need Palestinian unity,\" he said, adding that to be part of that unity Hamas needed to meet certain prerequisites.\n\nThe Russian initiative has come rather as a surprise to the western world, but it should not be marred by any indifference. As far as the question of Hamas participating at the 26 February meeting is considered, Russia may take help of its crucial ally Iran to influence the Hamas leadership to sit at the same table as other Palestinian factions and hammer out a long-term stand and policy for an earliest solution to the long running conflict.\n\nAt an interactive session at the security conference with the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, Jaishankar also delved on the question of India's alignment on non-alignment with Russia and the US.\n\nWhen asked about the country's foreign policy priorities in the backdrop of observations that it is traversing from \"non-alignment to all alignment\" and its continued procurement of crude oil from Russia notwithstanding Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Jaishankar asserted that India should not be criticised for having multiple options.\n\n\"Why should it be a problem? I am smart enough to have multiple options. You should be admiring and not criticising. Is it a problem for others? I do not think so,\" he said.\n\nThis is not the first time that the EAM has forcefully put across India's stand on its continued economic ties with Russia and the two state solution to the Palestinian issue. Rather it should be seen in the new paradigm shift of the global geopolitics, where India, once being a champion of non-alignment has been able to maintain ties with different ideologies based on its own interpretation and understanding of the issues, rather than being tutored by either super power.\n\nViews expressed in the article are the author's own and do not necessarily represent the editorial stance of Kashmir Observer",

During the operation, we made sure that the ship's crew exited safely.\"\n\nThe British maritime security firm Ambrey confirmed that the Rubymar is a UK-registered, Belize-flagged and Lebanese-operated cargo ship that came under attack late on Sunday.\n\nThe United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) also confirmed the incident - without naming the ship - and announced it took place some 35 nautical miles (65km) south of al-Makha (Mocha) in Yemen.\n\n\"Military authorities report crew have abandoned the vessel. Vessel at anchor and all crew are safe,\" it noted, adding, \"Military authorities remain on scene to provide assistance\".\n\nOn Monday, Ambrey said another vessel, a US-owned and Greek-flagged bulk carrier had called for military assistance citing a \"missile attack\". The UKMTO also confirmed the incident 100 nautical miles (185km) off Yemen's Aden, with both sources reporting the vessel's crew are safe.\n\nThe Houthi military also claimed to have downed a US-made MQ-9 Reaper attack drone over Yemen, which it said \"was carrying out hostile missions against our country on behalf of the Zionist entity\".\n\nIt did not provide any evidence, but it has downed the same drone - which is worth over $30m - several times before.\n\nThe Pentagon acknowledged in November that an MQ-9 was shot down over the Red Sea. The Houthis possess surface-to-air missile systems capable of shooting down the advanced drones.\n\nThe Houthis had claimed a confirmed missile attack on a British oil tanker that the US identified as a Panamanian-flagged vessel carrying crude bound for India.\n\nThe group has been disrupting trade through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden near its shores since October in a stated effort to support the Palestinian cause against Israel and its Western backers.\n\nThe Houthi military spokesman on Monday stated the group remains undeterred and attacks will continue.\n\nUS Central Command (CENTCOM) said it launched successful strikes against three mobile antiship cruise missiles, one surface drone, and one underwater drone. This, it added, marked the first time since the start of the war that the Houthis tried to use an unmanned underwater vessel.\n\n\"These actions will protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for US Navy and merchant vessels,\" it noted.\n\nIsrael's war on Gaza, which has killed more than 29,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, is showing no signs of stopping as Israel vows to expand its ground assault into Rafah, the last large city in the enclave where 1.4 million Palestinians are taking shelter.",

In response, the troops directed an aircraft to eliminate the squad. A short while later, four additional terrorists spotted in the area were also eliminated by Israeli aircraft.\n\nGround forces also called in a helicopter to strike and eliminate an additional terrorist.\n\nAlso Read | Tata vs Pakistan GDP: Tata Group's 'USD 365 Billion Market Capitalisation' Is Higher Than Pakistan's Gross Domestic Product Value 'USD 341 Billion', Say Reports.\n\nOn Sunday, terrorists fired a rocket from the central Gaza Strip which crossed into Israeli territory, landing in an open area near Kibbutz Be'eri near the Gaza border. A few minutes after the launch, soldiers identified the terrorist responsible for the launch in the area of Gaza City, directing an airstrike that killed him. Additional armed Hamas squads operating adjacent to the troops in the area were also eliminated.\n\nThe IDF added that sirens sounded in the communities surrounding the Gaza Strip on early Monday morning were a false alarm.\n\nAt least 1,200 people were killed and 240 Israelis and foreigners were taken hostage in Hamas's attacks on Israeli communities near the Gaza border on October 7. Of the remaining 134 hostages, Israel recently declared 31 of them dead.

        "text": "The Water Transport Workers Federation of India said in a statement that it has decided to \"refuse to load or unload weaponised cargoes\" from Israel or any other country which could handle military equipment for \"war in Palestine\".\n\n\"We the Port workers, part of labour unions would always stand against the war and killing [of] innocent people like women and children,\" a statement by the union said.\n\nThe union represents more than 3,500 workers at 11 government-owned ports in India.\n\n\"Women and children have been blown to pieces in the war. Parents were unable to recognise their children killed in bombings that were exploding everywhere,\" the statement added.\n\nIsrael has continued its ground invasion of the Gaza Strip after vowing to eradicate Hamas following the group's terror attack on southern Israel on 7 October, in which some 1,200 Israelis died and hundreds of civilians were taken hostage.\n\nMore than 29,000 Palestinians have been killed in the four-month war since, the Gaza health ministry said on Monday, as hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians have been pushed to the brink of starvation and much of the Strip's civilian infrastructure has been destroyed.\n\nIn an interview with the Middle East Eye, T Narendra Rao, general secretary of the Water Transport Workers Federation of India, said they will \"boycott\" handling of any vessel carrying arms or ammunitions or weaponised cargo to Israel.\n\nAt this stage the move is largely a symbolic measure to express solidarity with the Palestinians as, he said, the union's workers have yet to be involved in any weapons shipments to Israel since the Gaza war began.\n\nThe boycott comes after The Independent previously reported that an apparel manufacturing firm in India decided to halt further orders to make Israeli police uniforms on \"humanitarian grounds\".\n\nThe trade union is an affiliate of the World Federation of Trade Unions, a global body, and it was inspired to take this measure at a recent meeting in Athens where a number of union representatives expressed solidarity with Palestinians dying in the war.\n\n\"We decided them that we would do our bit and not handle any weapon-laden cargo, which will go onto assist Israel to kill more women and children as we are seeing and reading every day in the news,\" the union told Indian news website The Wire.\n\nIt comes days after it was reported that the Israeli army received 20 Indian-made Hermes 900 drones that have been used on the besieged strip.\n\nA source at Adani Group, which runs 12 ports across several states, told The Wire that the drones were supplied to Israel.\n\nThe deal has not been acknowledged publicly by India or Israel, which share close relations, despite India being among the international allies of Tel Aviv that have called for a two-state solution to the war.\n\nIndia has also been actively recruiting and training a migrant labour workforce to be sent to Israel to replace Palestinian workers, amid an acute shortage during the war. Recruitment drives are going on across Indian cities to recruit 10,000 to 20,000 workers for Israel in the coming months.",

        "title": "Washington is the supporter of genocide who sits in judgment of others",
        "text": "China\u2019s contrasting political repression and economic development in Tibet and Xinjiang does not hold a candle to US-sponsored state terrorism by Israel against the Palestinian people\n\nSometimes I wonder whether politicians in Washington are not humanoids preprogrammed by some master alien race to wreak havoc on earth.\n\nIt\u2019s simply hard to imagine lawmakers who are real human beings to be so devoid of elementary decency, a sense of shame or at least embarrassment. Not to mention there is the metaphorical blood on their hands and very literally the horrifying amount of blood spilled by devastating US-made weapons deliberately supplied to a genocidal ally.\n\nThe appalling irony of the day is that the US House of Representatives has passed legislation to protect Tibetans and Uygurs in China from human rights abuses. Seriously. These are the same US politicians who have been arming Israel to carry out the vilest and cruellest attacks on Muslims in Palestine.\n\nOne of the bills mandates a human rights tsar \u201cfor Uygur issues\u201d in the US State Department. Most people around the world would think it\u2019s far more urgent to address \u201cPalestinian issues\u201d, such as the daily massacres against them.\n\nThe three bills were sponsored by California Republican Young Kim, and Democrats Jim McGovern and Gregory Meeks.\n\nThese are the ones who have shouted loudly \u2013 like most of their congressional colleagues \u2013 about \u201cStanding with Israel as it defends itself against the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other terrorists\u201d, the actual mouthful name of a resolution passed overwhelmingly by Congress, the same legislature that voted to send weapons to Israel even before it had asked for them.US House passes 3 bills on China human rights, Asia-Pacific cooperation\n\nSometimes you really have to wonder whether Israel is a client state of the United States in the Middle East, or rather the United States is Israel\u2019s client state in North America.\n\nSome 29,000 Palestinians have been killed, and more than 67,780 injured, in Gaza since October 7 by Israel. So more than 1 per cent of the population are now dead, most of them women and children. Countless children have been maimed for life. But there are even mainstream news articles \u2013 which have been fully complicit in dehumanising the Palestinian people for decades \u2013 quoting US politicians who warned Israel\u2019s military operations could radicalise the next generation of Hamas terrorists.\n\nThat may be so, but not when those children have no legs or arms to work as \u201cterrorists\u201d, or when they are dead. There is a cruel and inhuman logic to Israel\u2019s imposition of a high death toll on Palestinian children \u2013 pre-empting their futures as \u201cterrorists\u201d, or poets, doctors, lawyers, librarians, scholars, scientists or comedians. But no, Israel does not distinguish; they are all terrorists.\n\nKim\u2019s bill authorises new action to protect China\u2019s Uygur populations from human rights abuses. McGovern\u2019s amends the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002, the basis of much of US policy on Tibet, to further counter Chinese disinformation about the autonomous region; in other words, more American state-sponsored propaganda to counter Chinese propaganda. At least you know the Chinese media are controlled by the state while the US state-funded media pretend to be independent and objective, and are so far more insidious and dangerous.\n\nThe third bill by Meeks aims to set up parliamentary ties with Australia, India and Japan, member states of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad.\n\nDidn\u2019t India a couple years ago amend its own constitution to revoke the autonomous status of Muslim-majority Jammu and Kashmir?\n\nIsolating and terrorising the Muslim population in India? The region has suffered more internet shutdowns and restrictions by Indian authorities than any other place by a foreign government in recent years.\n\nThat\u2019s OK. Bombing the Muslim population back to the Stone Age in Gaza? That\u2019s more than OK. It\u2019s Israel\u2019s right to self-defence, which according to former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo during a recent visit to Israel, is also making the world safer from terrorism. That\u2019s the man who overrode his own State Department lawyers\u2019 expert opinions and insisted on declaring China as having committed genocide in Xinjiang during his last days in office.Israeli forces kill 3 Palestinians in West Bank\n\nBut those evil Chinese! In the immoral, sorry, I meant immortal words of Kim, \u201cChairman Xi is trying to rebrand Xinjiang as a business and tourist destination and seeks to erase Uygurs from the international community\u2019s memory.\u201d\n\nMcGovern apparently thinks the same about Tibetan culture. Now that\u2019s genocide and human rights breaches, something we can\u2019t stand for.\n\nBut wait, how does using indigenous Uygur or Tibetan culture to promote tourism and business erase them from the international community\u2019s memory? Falsifying their authentic culture? Cultural misappropriation as genocide?\n\nDo people like Kim even process what they are saying before making a public statement?\n\nExploiting them for tourism and forcing them to work in new businesses is so much worse than terrorising or bombing entire Muslim populations to smithereens.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. It must be acknowledged that Beijing has quite a bit to account for in human rights breaches in those autonomous regions. However, it has also built schools, hospitals and mosques for the locals, and infrastructure to develop the economy. And they are still officially autonomous, unlike Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nI would say building is generally less genocidal than bombing and laying a medieval-style siege to induce famine against a particular racial group. It\u2019s just too rich for the US to stand in judgment over China\u2019s treatment of Muslims, or anyone else\u2019s.",

        "text": "Published On 19 Feb 2024\n\nThe Houthi group says it hit a British cargo ship that is believed to be significantly damaged and shot down a US drone over its territory as the Yemeni group continued to target ships in the Red Sea demanding an end to Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nThe Houthi claims of attacks come as the United States carried out five strikes in Yemen late on Saturday night as part of Washington's military campaign after Houthi targeting of Israeli-linked vessels disrupted global trade passing through the Red Sea. Houthis have now expanded their attacks to include US and UK ships after the two countries launched strikes on the war-torn Arab nation.\n\nThe Rubymar cargo ship suffered \"catastrophic damages and came to a complete halt\" after being targeted in a military operation, said Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree in a televised address on Monday.\n\n\"As a result of the extensive damage the ship suffered, it is now at risk of potential sinking in the Gulf of Aden. During the operation, we made sure that the ship's crew exited safely.\"\n\nThe British maritime security firm Ambrey confirmed that the Rubymar is a UK-registered, Belize-flagged and Lebanese-operated cargo ship that came under attack late on Sunday.\n\nThe United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) also confirmed the incident - without naming the ship - and said it took place some 35 nautical miles (65km) south of al-Makha (Mocha) in Yemen.\n\n\"Military authorities report crew have abandoned the vessel. Vessel at anchor and all crew are safe,\" it said. \"Military authorities remain on scene to provide assistance\".\n\nOn Monday, Ambrey said another vessel, a US-owned and Greek-flagged bulk carrier had called for military assistance citing a \"missile attack\". The UKMTO also confirmed the incident 100 nautical miles (185km) off Yemen's Aden, with both sources reporting the vessel's crew are safe.\n\nThe Houthi military also claimed to have downed a US-made MQ-9 Reaper attack drone over Yemen, which it said \"was carrying out hostile missions against our country on behalf of the Zionist entity\".\n\nIt did not provide any evidence, but it has downed the same drone - which is worth over $30m - several times before.\n\nThe Pentagon acknowledged in November that an MQ-9 was shot down over the Red Sea. The Houthis, who seized power in Yemen's capital Sanaa and the country's north in 2014, possess surface-to-air missile systems capable of shooting down the advanced drones.\n\nThe Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, had claimed a confirmed missile attack on a British oil tanker that the US identified as a Panamanian-flagged vessel carrying crude bound for India.\n\nThe Iran-backed group has been disrupting trade through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden near its shores since October in a stated effort to support the Palestinian cause against Israel and its Western backers.\n\nThe Houthi military spokesman on Monday said the group remains undeterred and attacks will continue.\n\nUS Central Command (CENTCOM) said it launched successful strikes against three mobile antiship cruise missiles, one surface drone, and one underwater drone. This, it said, marked the first time since the start of the war that the Houthis tried to use an unmanned underwater vessel.\n\n\"These actions will protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for US Navy and merchant vessels,\" it said.\n\nIsrael's war on Gaza, which has killed more than 29,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, is showing no signs of stopping as Israel vows to expand its ground assault into Rafah, the last large city in the enclave where 1.4 million Palestinians are taking shelter.",

        "text": "The worst news for Europeans is that Putin will stay in power for another six years: until 2030, he will remain the bane of NATO and the European Union (EU). A cornered Putin is even more dangerous because his decisions are increasingly risky, reckless and ruthless.\n\nThe Russian dictator has become the ultimate nemesis, a messianic blend of Lenin and Stalin, but with tsarist imperialist airs. He bears the stamp of power and to keep it he kills himself.\n\nNo critic is spared, neither inside Russia nor outside its borders. The hunt for his enemies or for people who have made him uncomfortable, be they journalists, activists, businessmen or oligarchs, has crossed borders, whether they are poisoning those who have gone into exile in the UK or finding massacred corpses with their families and in such bizarre situations.\n\nThe Soviet dictator, Yossif Stalin, had Leon Trotsky assassinated in Mexico, in Coyoacan. He could not stand the fact that this journalist and essayist, founder of the Red Army, competed with him in popularity; their relationship deteriorated to such a degree that Stalin accused him of anti-Soviet activities and he was exiled. Trotsky went to Mexico where he began a series of activities in which he questioned Stalin and accused him of serious repressions against the population and a cruel method of torture in prison.\n\nTrotsky suffered several attempts on his life before he was assassinated on 21 August 1940 by the Spanish communist Ramon Mercader, hired by Kotov, an agent of the Soviet NKVD.\n\nTsar Putin is just following the old tactics of his worst predecessors. He has no point of balance in his personality and cannot be more unsettling because he is capable of anything... he has no limits, no morals. He is not clearly distinguishing between right and wrong, nor is he tempting his heart, he has fully developed his psychopathic personality.\n\nHe has started to hunt his enemies using key dates as an act of revenge, but he also does it to frighten Russians and Europeans. For the psychopath wields his power by playing on the weaknesses, fears and vulnerabilities of others.\n\nHe has toyed with the idea of a tactical nuclear bomb and a return to Soviet territorial grandeur that has sent shivers down the spines of small countries like Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Moldova. As Finland begins to reinforce its border with the Russian Federation and in Poland, the army lives in fear of invasion at dawn. Putin is playing on these fears.\n\nAnd no wonder. I don't think the Kremlin will ever use a nuclear bomb because it knows that, with nuclear weapons, whoever fires first will not win, but lose. It is not the same scenario as with the nuclear bombs of 6 and 9 August 1945 dropped by the United States on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nThe United States was the only country with such technology at the time, so there was no balance of power. Today, there are nine countries with nuclear bomb arsenals: in addition to the US, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, Pakistan, Israel, North Korea and India.\n\nWhat I do believe is in Putin's plans is to invade Eastern Europe. He is obsessed with regaining not only the territories that were part of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), but also the Soviet area of influence, known as the Eastern Bloc or Soviet Bloc.\n\nHe will not settle for Ukraine. Putin is ready for a big war into which he will throw his citizens and into which he will throw NATO; a Transatlantic Alliance that, if Trump returns to power, will not have the protective umbrella of the United States and that will be the trigger for the Russian invasion.\n\nThese days we have seen the consequences of the lack of military and economic aid that the United States has been providing to Ukraine to resist the Russian invasion: they have lost Avdivivka, a battle in which the Ukrainian military had been engaged for more than eight months, repelling the Russian army and the separatist forces of the Donbas. They only just lost the position for lack of weapons and money to buy more ammunition... more than 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers are trapped, many of them wounded.\n\nPutin knows that in Ukraine he only has to hold out a little longer, wait for Trump's arrival in the White House, to continue with his plan: kill Zelensky and carry out the final assault on Kiev; surrender Ukraine and put in place a puppet government. And then he will invade the smaller European countries that he has already been pointing to as traitors of the Soviet past.\n\nThe Kremlin has just put Estonia's prime minister, Kaja Kallas, under arrest, but also added high-ranking officials and MPs from Latvia and Lithuania to the list. Putin openly accuses them of disavowing their Soviet past and destroying the Soviet monuments that remain in these territories, which have been independent republics since 1991. These are countries that are also within the European Union.\n\nFor Europe, terrible years lie ahead as long as Putin remains in power in Russia. He is frankly obsessed with restoring the old zone of political, military and economic influence and we have no doubt that he is capable of anything. The recent death in bizarre conditions of Alexei Navalny, one month before the Russian elections, is nothing more than a message to frighten all those who would try anything against the Russian dictator. As US President Joe Biden said a few months ago, \"he is a murderer\". A murderer who is certainly capable of dying, killing.",

Recruitment drives are going on across Indian cities to recruit 10,000 to 20,000 workers for Israel in the coming months.",

        "text": "People who live on a constant diet of Canadian political news, such as newspaper editorialists, have noticed that a certain word is on the lips of Liberal government cabinet members, and on those of others in Ottawa with the power to change things, an awful lot these days. It's unacceptable.\n\nNo, we mean that the word is \"unacceptable.\" Not that its use is unacceptable, although we may be getting there.\n\nLast week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that an act of vandalism committed at an Islamic centre was \"alarming, abhorrent, and [emphasis ours] unacceptable,\" as if to make sure that no one thought that an alarming and abhorrent act of racism might be acceptable.\n\nIn December, he said that allegations of rape and harassment at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service were \"unacceptable.\" In November, he said racists attacks on a Jewish community centre were \"deplorable and unacceptable.\"\n\nIn October, he said the murderous attack by Hamas terrorists that killed some 1,200 people was \"completely unacceptable,\" and that a subsequent Israeli bombing of a hospital in Gaza was \"absolutely unacceptable.\"\n\nIn September, he said that allegations that India was behind the assassination of a Canadian citizen in British Columbia was an \"unacceptable violation of our sovereignty,\" allowing for the possibility of an acceptable violation of our sovereignty.\n\nIn August, he said it was \"unacceptable\" that refugees seeking asylum in Canada were sleeping in the streets of Toronto. In July, he declared the decision by a union representing port workers in British Columbia to reject a mediated settlement to be \"unacceptable.\"\n\nMost famously, Mr. Trudeau in 2022 said the truckers who blockaded Ottawa held views that were \"unacceptable,\" an unguarded comment he undoubtedly wishes he could take back, or at least ought to.\n\nIt's not just the Prime Minister. Foreign Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said last week that Israel's announced intention to extend its military offensive to the city of Rafah, where more than a million Gazans are trapped, was \"unacceptable.\"\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said last July that the inability of some people in Nova Scotia to receive flooding alerts on their cellphones was \"unacceptable.\" The head of the Canadian Border Services Agency, Erin O'Gorman, said last week the failure of government oversight that led to the agency spending well over $60-million on a single smartphone app was, you know, \"unacceptable.\"\n\nTerrorist attacks, war tactics that put civilians in harm's way, acts of racism, extra-national assassinations, allegations of sexual assault, gross government incompetence, a lack of housing, diverging political views, union tactics and poor cellular service - these are all \"unacceptable\" in Ottawa.\n\nThey are also things that no one would ever presume to be anything but unacceptable. It's like using your government account to tweet out, \"It is unacceptable that my hair is on fire,\" thereby announcing that you are on what you believe everyone would agree is the right side of the issue, without making a commitment to address your flaming scalp.\n\nNot that nothing ever gets done. The federal government went on to provide Toronto with funding to address its refugee housing crisis, for instance.\n\nBut too often it's just bloodless outrage, designed for a political era that has raised messaging on social media to a high art, while reducing the content of that messaging to a base set of empty words and tropes.\n\nEveryone does it. It's not confined to the Liberal government. Their \"that's unacceptable\" is Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's \"bring home common sense\" - simplistic sloganeering that leaves people less informed than they were before they read the words.\n\nBut with the Trudeau government rapidly running out of steam, and Canadians worried about the cost of housing and food, and about the state of the world, telling them that unacceptable things are unacceptable comes across more as posturing than as helpful; as a bit of easy moralizing to replace real action.\n\nIf you find something unacceptable and you are in government, you had better be prepared to do something about it. Failure to take useful action on an issue you have identified would be ... well, you know.",

        "text": "Israeli soldiers stand by a truck packed with stripped, bound, and blindfolded Palestinian prisoners, Friday December 8, 2023 (photo) Testimonies obtained from released detainees indicate that Israel continues to commit horrific crimes, including torture, inhumane and degrading treatment, against thousands of Gazans detained and held incommunicado in undisclosed locations, some for over four months. Unlawfully detained persons have been stripped naked and photographed and otherwise humiliated by IDF forces. They have been sexually assaulted, attacked by dogs, beaten, starved, burned with cigarettes and denied legal representation. Human rights experts fear that detainees face summary execution in sites where conditions are chillingly similar to those established by US forces in Abu Grahib and elsewhere.\n\nBy Diane Paul. 12 February 2024\n\nRamallah, West Bank, Palestine\n\nNumerous Palestinian and international human rights organizations, UN agencies and news sources report that following the events of October 7, 2023, Israeli forces and prison guards have arbitrarily detained thousands of Gazans in secret locations under circumstances referred to by human rights experts as \"enforced disappearance.\" Estimates of the number of \"disappeared\" range between 1000 and 5000, but rights groups say no one knows the true number.\n\n\"Enforced disappearance\" is a legal term referring to \"the arrest, detention, abduction or any other form of deprivation of liberty by agents of the State...followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person, which places such a person outside the protection of the law.\"\n\nSince December 2023, international reporting on the disappearances has been relatively limited, with little new information coming to light. Recent threats by the Israeli government to enter Rafah and conduct ground operations there raises the spectre of further mass enforced disappearances.\n\nAl Jazeera reported in late October that thousands of workers from Gaza employed in Israel when the war started have gone missing \"amid a campaign of mass arrests.\" Palestinian Minister of Labor Nasri Abu Jaish told The Independent that some 4500 Gazans registered to work in Israel were missing; another labor leader claimed the number was closer to 5000. (Israel revoked work permits for Gazans just a few days after October 7th).\n\nThe UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) has also received \"numerous disturbing reports from the north of Gaza of mass detentions, ill-treatment and enforced disappearance of possibly thousands of Palestinian men and boys, and a number of women and girls, at the hands of Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). Most were rounded up as they were attempting to move south or were taken during operations conducted on their homes, hospitals, schools and other places of refuge.\"\n\nFamily members told The Washington Post in early December that \"they saw relatives with no ties to Hamas or armed groups led away by Israeli soldiers at gunpoint and have heard nothing from them since.\" Eyewitnesses said they heard some soldiers saying that the detainees would be transferred to the \"Zikim\" area, north of the Gaza Strip.\n\nIsraeli military forces stormed the Beit Lahia area on December 9th and detained hundreds of Palestinians present in the area.\n\nEuro-Med Human Rights Monitor reported on 26 December that nearly 3000 Palestinian civilians had recently been kidnapped from homes and shelters and remained missing. \"Over the past few days,\" Euro-Med stated, \"the Israeli army has been detaining hundreds of Palestinians, including women, in the Sheikh Radwan neighbourhood in Gaza City.\" The organization also claimed that \"hundreds of additional civilians were arrested in Jabalia al-Balad and its camp, north of Gaza, and in the neighbourhoods east of Gaza City, where they were subjected to the same inhumane policy by members of the Israeli military.\"\n\nA number of prominent individuals as well as persons with US and Canadian citizenship have been detained without charge and remain missing; among them:\n\nTwo officials from the Al Amal hospital in Southern Gaza, Dr. Haider Al Qudra (General Manager) and Maher Attalah (Administrative Director), both disappeared after being summoned by the Israeli military, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society. 36 medical workers doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers (reported by the Gaza Health Ministry to The Washington Post) from the Al-Shifa Hospital. Among the detained medical staff is Al-Shifa Hospital Director Mohamed Abu Salmiya, who the IDF says allowed Hamas to use bunkers underneath the hospital as a command center, an allegation denied by the Ministry and medical staff. Nidal Suhali al-Waheidi (an internationally acclaimed photojournalist from the Al Najah Channel) and Haitham Abdelwahed/Abdelwahid (Ain Media Agency), both from the occupied Gaza Strip. According to Amnesty International, they were detained by Israeli forces on 7 October while reporting the Hamas-led attack and \"are held in conditions constituting enforced disappearance. Since then, Israeli authorities have refused to disclose their whereabouts or the legal grounds and reasons for their arrest.\"\n\nThe Israeli Supreme Court has since denied an appeal to disclose their fates, stating in a response to a petition filed by Israeli human rights organization HaMoked that \"Israel held no obligation towards residents of the Gaza Strip, given that it was a territory controlled by a terrorist organization and did not establish what were the legal framework and duties incumbent on Israel in holding Gazans.\"\n\nBorak Alagha, 18, and Hashem Alagha, 20 (brothers and US citizens) and their father, a Canadian citizen, were detained on February 8th, 2024. According to family members interviewed by PBS, \"Soldiers tied up and blindfolded the women and children in the family and placed them outside the home.\" A mentally disabled uncle and two other adult male relatives were also taken away by the Israelis and remain missing. Other adult male relatives of the Alagha family were also detained, along with men of a neighboring household, for a total of about 20 detained. Human rights defender and head of Al Awda Hospital\u202fAhmed Muhanna\u202fwas forcibly disappeared by Israeli military forces from the hospital on 17 December 2023 at approximately 1 pm in the Northern Gaza Strip. Frontline Defenders reported that \"The situation intensified on the day following the unlawful detentions when Israeli forces returned to the hospital, bringing the human rights defender with them. Subsequently, 11additional people were unlawfully detained, including 5 staff members, and Muhanna was again taken to an unknown location.\" Reports of Summary Executions during and after Military Operations\n\nEuro-Med Human Rights Monitor conducted a comprehensive analysis of dozens of testimonies and video clips that revealed cases of summary executions. \"Israeli forces frequently blow up doors and throw bombs during their raids of Palestinian homes and shelter centers...[the IDF] then storm the buildings to shoot, execute, and kill everybody inside -- either for no apparent reason, or for 'crimes' as simple as two civilians speaking with each other. They later force any survivors out of the homes or shelters, forcing the men to strip completely naked while the women are searched and harassed.\"\n\nThe Palestine Prisoner's Association (PPA) noted with alarm that aside from the occupation's confession to having executed one Gaza detainee, two Gazan workers were killed in detention and several detainees in the army Sde Teman camp near Beersheba died under mysterious circumstances. The identity of only one of the two workers was revealed by the occupation.\n\nReports of Torture, Inhumane and Humiliating Treatment\n\nFront Line Defenders has described the process of the mass detention of persons, among them human rights defenders, as beginning with the separation of families. Men are often stripped of their clothing. Then their hands are bound and they are blindfolded before being forced into the backs of trucks that transfer them to detention camps, where they endure further ill-treatment, hunger and cold.\u202fPhotos and videos\u202fpublished on social media depicted Palestinian men being paraded in the streets,\u202fheads bowed, while others showed Israeli military trucks carrying detainees in the same degrading conditions. [This scenario is horrifically identical to occurrences documented in Bosnia during ethnic cleansing 30 years ago by this writer. What often came next: torture, starvation and summary executions].\n\nAmnesty International's International Crisis Evidence Lab has verified \"photos and video footage [that] show Israeli forces' inhuman and degrading treatment of detainees in Beit Lahia, a city in northern Gaza.\"\n\nA human rights lawyer in Ramallah provided video footage compiled through searches of social media, much of it posted by IDF soldiers.\n\nhttps://israelpalestinenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-15-vid1.mp4 https://israelpalestinenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-15-vid2.mp4 https://israelpalestinenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/2-15-vid3.mp4\n\nTranslation: Video| They were extinguishing cigarettes on the bodies of prisoners.. Testimony of a Palestinian from the Gaza Strip who was released by the Israeli occupation after being detained for more than 50 days. He recounts the details of the \"horrific\" torture he experienced with a number of other detainees.\n\nOHCHR has reported that many detainees have been subjected to serious ill-treatment, which in some instances may amount to torture: they were \"forced to strip down to their underwear, were blindfolded and tightly handcuffed, and were filmed and photographed in deliberately humiliating positions prior to being transported, without their clothing and with little food or water, to unknown places of detention...Credible information has also been received that approximately 140 women and girls have been arbitrarily detained and are currently being detained in undisclosed locations.\" Families of detainees have not been provided any information on the fate or location of their loved ones or any reasons for their detention -- exacerbating their sense of anguish and fear.\"\n\nWomen from Sheikh Radwan were taken to Yarmouk Stadium, says Euro-Med, \"where they had their veils removed and were searched by soldiers...[and also] also endured explicit abuse, beatings, and harassment...many were threatened with rape. One detained woman (later released) was transported in an Israeli military truck alongside a group of naked men...Palestinian males, including children as young as 10 years old and elderly people over the age of 70, were forced to take off all of their clothes except their underwear and line up in a humiliating manner in front of the women detained in the same stadium.\"\n\nA member of the rights group Al Haq in Ramallah stressed that Israel has also refused to return the bodies of the dead to families.\n\nDenial of Legal Representation\n\nThe Israeli Knesset approved an extension of an emergency order that allows Israeli authorities to deny detained Palestinians from Gaza the option to meet with lawyers, a move strongly condemned by PPS. The order, which allows Israel to prevent prisoners from meeting with a lawyer for up to 180 days, was extended for an additional four months. This enables the occupation to carry out further crimes without any oversight. PPS claims the Israeli government is using the order as a cover to commit further crimes.\n\nPalestinian lawyers who previously had access to prisoners at Ofer are now not permitted to visit anyone, including detainees from the West Bank. As far as is known, only one lawyer has had any access to Gazan detainees.\n\nDenial of Red Cross Access to Detainees\n\nTo date, no access to detainees has been granted to any organization, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which states it has not had access to places of detention in Israel since October 7, 2023, despite repeated requests to the Israeli government. In another serious development, ICRC, previously able to visit detainees from the West Bank, is now barred from all detention facilities. (An estimated 6500 Palestinians from the West Bank have been detained since October 7th; at least 3000 are being held under administrative detention without charges made or release dates).\n\nICRC has also been denied access to Israeli hostages/IDF prisoners held by Hamas.\n\nAccording to International law, offers by ICRC to visit persons deprived of their liberty must be examined in good faith and may not be arbitrarily refused. Registration of detainees by ICRC can serve to prevent extra-judicial executions, torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. ICRC monitors conditions of detention, ensures family members are informed of the whereabouts of loved one and works to arrange resumption of contact between family members.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, families of detained or missing persons can file tracing requests via national Red Cross or Red Crescent Societies or ICRC, but given conditions in Gaza, it is impossible for families to make such requests. Not only is this extremely traumatizing for families who have no idea where their loved ones are, it makes it much more difficult to determine the number of persons missing.\n\nSo where are the Gazan detainees?\n\nHuman rights activists working on prisoner rights interviewed in Ramallah this week say no one knows the location of many detention sites, although some have been identified through reports from released prisoners and forensic evidence gathered via social media.\n\nIn December, representatives from The Commission for Ex-Prisoners' Affairs, the Palestinian Prisoners' Club and the Addameer Foundation for Prisoners Care and Human Rights told Middle East Monitor that \"Several hundred detainees from Gaza are believed to be detained in sections 23 and 25 in Ofer Prison, where many detainees from the West Bank are held.\" Ex-detainees also told the rights groups that \"Israeli guards carry out horrific crimes and degrading treatment against detainees from Gaza, including asking them to bark like dogs before giving them meals, and demanding they sing pro-Israel songs in a loud voice, adding that they could clearly hear their screams around the clock as a result of the torture and abuse meted out against them.\"\n\nMany Gazan detainees were laborers present in Israel on October 7th who did not participate in any hostilities. Those who have been released were sent back to Gaza though the Karm Abu Salem crossing and left to walk long distances in great danger to search for family members whose whereabouts are unknown. It has not been possible to reach them to do detailed interviews due to war conditions.\n\nFemale detainees from the West Bank held in Damon prison similarly reported that women from Gaza are held separately there and \"were heard screaming in other parts of the prison.\"\n\nOne worker told Israeli human rights group HaMoked (as reported by TruthOut) that he was held in a roofless cage, exposed to the sun and deprived of water, food and toilet access for three days. He was then \"moved to a 300 square meter camp in which hundreds of fellow day laborers were forced to share one toilet. He was beaten and cursed at by Israeli guards when he asked to contact the Red Cross.\"\n\nSome female detainees have reportedly been held at Anatut Military Base under tent canopies in the open air, sleeping on mattresses on the ground, said a worker with Adameer. The past several weeks have been marked by cold weather and rain.\n\nAdvocates have called upon the international community to pressure Israel to release those held arbitrarily, reveal the names and fate of all detainees; stop the arbitrary arrest and detention of Gazans during operations in Gaza and end the torture and humiliation of detainees.\n\nIn addition, human rights experts say, governments must insist that the Israeli government provide immediate and unrestricted access to all detainees by the International Committee of the Red Cross.\n\nDiane Paul is a human rights researcher/activist and a licensed clinical social worker whose work has primarily focused on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, with over thirty years' experience. She has particular interest in the protection of civilians in armed conflict, protection of marginalized children, immigrant rights and tracing/restoring family links for families separated by armed conflict.

        "text": "The latest ship struck by the Houthis has reportedly taken significant damage, with crew abandoning the cargo vessel.\n\nThe Houthi group says it hit a British cargo ship that is believed to be significantly damaged and shot down a US drone over its territory as the Yemeni group continued to target ships in the Red Sea demanding an end to Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nThe Houthi claims of attacks come as the United States carried out five strikes in Yemen late on Saturday night as part of Washington's military campaign after Houthi targeting of Israeli-linked vessels disrupted global trade passing through the Red Sea. Houthis have now expanded their attacks to include US and UK ships after the two countries launched strikes on the war-torn Arab nation.\n\nThe Rubymar cargo ship suffered \"catastrophic damages and came to a complete halt\" after being targeted in a military operation, said Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saree in a televised address on Monday.\n\n\"As a result of the extensive damage the ship suffered, it is now at risk of potential sinking in the Gulf of Aden. During the operation, we made sure that the ship's crew exited safely.\"\n\nThe British maritime security firm Ambrey confirmed that the Rubymar is a UK-registered, Belize-flagged and Lebanese-operated cargo ship that came under attack late on Sunday.\n\nThe United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) also confirmed the incident - without naming the ship - and said it took place some 35 nautical miles (65km) south of al-Makha (Mocha) in Yemen.\n\n\"Military authorities report crew have abandoned the vessel. Vessel at anchor and all crew are safe,\" it said. \"Military authorities remain on scene to provide assistance\".\n\nThe Houthi military also claimed to have downed a US-made MQ-9 Reaper attack drone over Yemen, which it said \"was carrying out hostile missions against our country on behalf of the Zionist entity\".\n\nIt did not provide any evidence but claimed it has downed the same drone - which is worth over $30m - before.\n\nThe Pentagon acknowledged in November that an MQ-9 was shot down over the Red Sea. The Houthis, who seized power in Yemen's capital Sanaa and the country's north in 2014, possess surface-to-air missile systems capable of shooting down the advanced drones.\n\nThe Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, had claimed a confirmed missile attack on a British oil tanker that the US identified as a Panamanian-flagged vessel carrying crude bound for India.\n\nThe Iran-backed group has been disrupting trade through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden near its shores since October in a stated effort to support the Palestinian cause against Israel and its Western backers.\n\nThe Houthi military spokesman on Monday said the group remains undeterred and attacks will continue.\n\nUS Central Command (CENTCOM) said it launched successful strikes against three mobile antiship cruise missiles, one surface drone, and one underwater drone. This, it said, marked the first time since the start of the war that the Houthis tried to use an unmanned underwater vessel.\n\n\"These actions will protect freedom of navigation and make international waters safer and more secure for US Navy and merchant vessels,\" it said.\n\nIsrael's war on Gaza, which has killed more than 29,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, is showing no signs of stopping as Israel vows to expand its ground assault into Rafah, the last large city in the enclave where 1.4 million Palestinians are taking shelter.",

The Houthis had also shot down a U.S drone in the port city of Hodeidah, he said.\n\n\"The ship was seriously hit which caused it to stop completely. As a result of the extensive damage the ship suffered, it is now at risk of sinking in the Gulf of Aden,\" Sarea said.\n\nThe Belize-flagged, British-registered and Lebanese-operated general cargo ship came under attack in the Bab al-Mandab Strait off Yemen on Sunday, British maritime security firm Ambrey said.\n\nThe UK Maritime Trade Operations agency reported on Sunday that the crew had abandoned a ship off Yemen after an explosion - apparently the same incident.\n\nIran-aligned Houthi forces have made repeated drone and missile attacks against international commercial shipping in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab Strait - a route that accounts for about 12% of the world's shipping traffic - in what they say is support for Palestinians in the war between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe attacks have prompted several companies to halt Red Sea voyages and take a longer and more expensive route around Africa. U.S. and British warplanes have carried out retaliatory strikes across Yemen.\n\nAmbrey said the ship was heading north during its journey from Khor Fakkan in the United Arab Emirates to Varna, Bulgaria, when the attack occurred.\n\n\"The partially laden vessel briefly slowed from 10 to six knots and deviated course, and contacted the Djiboutian Navy, before returning to her previous course and speed,\" it said.\n\nThe UK maritime agency said it had received a report of an incident 35 miles south of Al Mukha, a town on Yemen's Red Sea coast, and that an explosion close to a vessel had resulted in damage. It did not identify the ship.\n\n\"Military authorities report crew have abandoned the vessel,\" it said in an updated advisory note early on Monday, adding that the vessel was at anchor and all the crew were safe.\n\nThe CEO of QatarEnergy, Saad al-Kaabi, said on Monday that disruption to shipping in the Red Sea region would impact its deliveries of liquefied natural gas (LNG) but not its production.\n\n\"It's only going to take longer to get it there. But it will not reach a point where we have to stop production because there isn't any ship. We're okay,\" Kaabi said at a groundbreaking ceremony at the Ras Laffan petrochemical complex.\n\nOne of the world's largest exporters of LNG, QatarEnergy said in January it had stopped sailing via the Red Sea for security reasons.\n\nT\u00fcrkiye determined to increase contacts with Egypt for peace in region, Erdogan says Explosion occurs at Iran's gas pipeline India PM opens grand temple on razed mosque site",

Marc Miguez, commander of US Carrier Strike Group Two, told the Associated Press.\n\nMiguez said the US does not have enough intelligence to cope with Yemeni USVs and that the threat could be extremely lethal in some circumstances.\n\n\"And if you're not immediately on scene, it can get ugly extremely quick,\" he told the Associated Press.\n\nThe comments come amid continued confrontation between the Yemenis and a US-led coalition of maritime forces in regional waters off Yemen.\n\nThe confrontation began in mid-October after the Yemenis started to hit ships linked to Israel in a bid to force the regime to stop its aggression against the people in Gaza.\n\nYemen's attacks expanded later after the US and Britain carried out strikes from air and sea on sites hosting the Arab country's missile and drone capabilities.\n\nThe Yemenis said on Saturday that they had used \"a large number of appropriate naval missiles\" to launch accurate and direct attacks on the Britain-linked oil ship Pollux in the Red Sea.\n\nThe US Central Command (Centcom) confirmed the attacks by the Yemenis late on Friday on Pollux, described as a Panamanian-flagged, Denmark-owned, Panamanian-registered vessel.\n\nThe US State Department also said the ship had loaded oil from Russia and was due to discharge in India in late February.",

        "text": "In a weekend of multiple attacks by the Houthis, they claim to have had their largest strike since they entered the war between Israel and Hamas in October with claims a bulk carrier has been struck, its crew evacuated, and a risk the ship could sink.\n\nAn explosion happened in close proximity to the Belize-flagged Rubymar on Sunday night, resulting in damage. The ship is owned by Golden Adventure Shipping from the UK. The attack took place in the Bab al-Mandeb strait, whilst the vessel was heading northbound from Khorfakkan in the UAE to Varna, Bulgaria.\n\nSubsequent updates said that the crew was forced to abandon the ship due to damage from a reported fire onboard. There have been no reports of crew injuries.\n\nA spokesperson for the Houthis has since said the ship is close to sinking, potentially becoming the first total constructive loss since the Red Sea shipping crisis started four months ago. Houthis have exaggerated details of damage to ships in the past and at present there is no way of corroborating how badly hit the vessel is.\n\nAdding to the confusion, an update from the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said. \"Vessel at anchor and all crew are safe.\"\n\nMeanwhile, British maritime security consultants Ambrey notes that the vessel had been drifting in a pattern consistent with engine failure for much of the weekend prior to the strike.\n\nThe ship had been temporarily detained in December 2023 for several propulsion and auxiliary machinery defects including main engine propulsion, auxiliary engine, and bilge pumping arrangements.\n\nOn Friday, the Houthis struck the British-owned oil tanker Pollux with a missile. The tanker was transporting Russian oil from the Russian Black Sea port city of Novorossiyskand and was on its way to bring the oil to a refinery in Paradip, India.\n\nAdding to the heightened sense of fear for seafarers facing Red Sea transits, US forces over the weekend identified and destroyed a new class of weaponry in Yemen: a drone submersible, also known as an unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV).\n\nOn Friday, the International Bargaining Forum (IBF) - where crew employers and unions meet - revealed an agreement allowing seafarers to refuse to sail on ships passing through the Red Sea.\n\nSeafarers must give seven days' notice prior to entering the high risk area, given the logistical constraints of passage and the difficulty to facilitate disembarkation in a safe port and mobilise repatriation in the area.\n\nToday marks the three-month anniversary since the Houthis seized the Galaxy Leader car carriers and its 25 seafarers in the Red Sea.\n\nThe maritime industry, via many of the world's leading shipping associations, has joined together from around the world to express their concern for the seafarers who have been held hostage, and call on the Houthis to release the crew.\n\n\"The 25 seafarers who make up the crew of the Galaxy Leader are innocent victims of the ongoing aggression against world shipping, and their plight is a major concern as the merchant shipping community continues to come under attack,\" a statement issued today reads, adding: \"It is abhorrent that seafarers were seized by military forces and that they have been kept from their families and loved ones for too long.\"",

        "title": "5 Myths about Israel and the War in Gaza",
        "text": "\"The problem that Israel faces with Hamas, and eventually Hezbollah, and ultimately Iran, while it is existential for Israel, and dangerous and difficult in many specific ways, is a variant of a larger problem that has nothing, in principle, to do with Israel or Jews or American foreign policy. This is a larger clash of cultures -- I hesitate to follow Samuel Huntington in calling it a clash of civilizations, because I think real civilization -- what we mean by \"civilization\" at this point in the 21st century -- exists on only one side of this divide. And this clash is happening, in varying degrees, in a hundred countries. In most places, it can be described as a conflict between Islamic extremists -- more appropriately called jihadists -- and ordinary human beings struggling to maintain the norms of open societies... I fully expect that civilized people throughout the world -- non-Muslim and Muslim -- will be fighting jihadists for decades to come. If I live to be 100, I do not expect to live to see the end of this problem. Needless to say, I hope I'm wrong...\n\nThere is no ethical or political argument that makes sense of the sight of lifeless children being pulled from rubble. With just a glimpse of the imagery coming out of Gaza, it is only natural to think that any action that could produce such carnage must be evil. It is absolutely natural to feel that, since urban warfare guarantees that innocent children will die, violence cannot be the answer. So Israel should just stop fighting. But this is an illusion. However horrific, even unthinkable, sometimes war is necessary. Now, many of the decisions Israel has made in how it wages this war are certainly debatable. But there is no way of waging it without a massive loss of innocent life...\n\nWhat is the alternative to violence for Israel in its current conflict with Hamas, given what Hamas did on October 7th, and given what it has vowed to do again at any opportunity? Pacifism? Pacifism only works against a morally sane adversary. It worked against the British in India. But pacifism would not have worked against the Nazis. Had the Allies decided that war is just too awful, and they just couldn't stomach killing any more German children, we would all be living in the 1000-year Reich. And if the Israelis practiced pacifism, Hamas and Hezbollah and a fair number of ordinary Palestinians would simply murder them. This is not an opinion. This is what these groups have claimed openly for decades. And if there were any doubt -- and there was never any doubt -- October 7th has made it obscene to doubt this now. What more do you need? Hamas has said that it will repeat the atrocities of October 7th again and again. And recent polls indicate that 80 percent of Palestinians approve of what they did. You might worry that Palestinians can't afford to answer such polls honestly, for fear of Hamas, but support for Hamas is around 40 percent in recent polls. Support for what Hamas did on October 7th is double that. So many those who had the courage to say they don't support Hamas still approve of what happened on October 7th.\n\nThe problem for Israel, and for the whole world, is that Jihadism is more dangerous than Nazism. Jihadists are Nazis who are certain of paradise. They are Nazis who are eager to die and have their children die because they actually believe in martyrdom. They don't just sort of believe in it. They don't merely hope that it's true. They absolutely believe that dying while attempting to kill infidels, or apostates, or Jews leads directly to Paradise... I'm not saying that ordinary nationalism and tribalism aren't also part of the problem. They are. There are many contributors to every conflict. I'm talking about what makes these particular conflicts worse than those born of ordinary nationalism, or tribalism, or competition for resources, or any other earthly motive.\n\nThe aims of jihadists really are antithetical to everything that civilized people value, and are right to value, in the 21st century. And the fact that we have on our own side rich, educated people, who are concerned about gay rights and trans rights and women's rights, who want to fight climate change and save the whales, taking the side of Hamas in the aftermath of their atrocities on October 7th, just reveals how confused and decadent and morally vulnerable our civilization has become. We have to face the facts that are staring us in the face. And, most important, the majority of Muslims everywhere need to face these facts and be honest about what jihadism is, and where a sincere belief in martyrdom leads. They have to moderate Islam in ways that other religions have been moderated. And there are some hopeful signs that this is happening -- at least among the rulers of the gulf states. But a disavowal of jihadism needs to become the majority opinion among 2 billion Muslims worldwide. Until this happens, there will be no exit from these sorts of conflicts.\n\nMyth #1: Israel is guilty of \"genocide\" in Gaza.\n\nThe term \"genocide\" has a clear meaning -- it's the destruction or attempted destruction of a whole people... To claim that Israel has perpetrated a genocide in Gaza, or that it has attempted genocide anywhere, is patently false. There were around 250,000 people in Gaza in 1948. There are now more than 2 million. This rate of growth is triple the world average. So if Israel has perpetrated a genocide in Gaza, it is the most inept genocide in history. And yet this false charge has been made against Israel for years. It's telling that the most recent allegations of genocide could be heard before Israel had dropped a single bomb in response to the atrocities of October 7th. Really, people were shrieking \"genocide\" on October 8th. What does that tell you? This is just a new blood libel.\n\nOf course, it is true that the Israeli Defense Forces have killed a lot of people in Gaza. However, it is also true that if the IDF wanted to kill every person in Gaza next week -- that is, actually commit genocide -- it could. But, of course, it doesn't want to do that and has never wanted to do that. In fact, the Israeli army routinely drops leaflets, and broadcasts on the radio, and calls cellphones to alert Palestinian civilians when specific areas will be bombed. They did this for weeks in advance of their most recent invasion of Gaza. Conversely, Hamas is using its own population as human shields. It built its headquarters under a hospital, and built hundreds of miles of tunnels under civilian apartments and schools and mosques, and fires its rockets from populated areas, and often prevents families from evacuating in a conscious attempt to maximize the loss of innocent life. These are war crimes.\n\nOf course, the IDF makes terrible mistakes, and this is inevitable in war. The IDF recently killed Israeli hostages who were mere moments away from being rescued. There are tragic accidents and errors of judgment in every war. However, any conflict with jihadists is made immeasurably worse by the tactics they use. Why can't Israeli soldiers simply trust people who appear unarmed and want to surrender or move to safety? Because they are confronting a culture of religious fanatics that has produced an endless supply of suicide bombers over the last 50 years. Just take a moment to contemplate how the tactic of suicide bombing changes everything. Nothing and no one can be taken at face value. Normally, if someone is driving a car or truck, you can be confident that he hasn't rigged it to explode. Most people aren't eager to die. We rely on the near universality of that attitude in all kinds of ways. But here we are talking about people who have literally rigged children to explode -- this has happened in a dozen different conflicts with jihadists across the world -- many of which had nothing to do with Israel or the West or even non-Muslims. How do you expect an army, or a police force, or any other organization, to deal with this possibility in a compassionate and civilized way -- one that is recognized to be compassionate and civilized by all the innocent people who are subjected to it, day after day and year after year, at check points, and in other places where they have to be treated like they too might be suicide bombers? Just imagine what it is like to have to wonder whether a child is actually a bomb? And just think for a moment about a culture that has normalized this nihilistic behavior -- a culture that literally teaches the love of martyrdom to 6 year-olds in school. This has nothing to do with Israel or Jews -- or the Palestinians even. This is just jihadism. For instance, Boko Haram routinely uses children as suicide bombers in Nigeria, and elsewhere in Africa. This insane behavior has nothing to do with Israel. Most members of Boko Haram have never met anyone who has ever met anyone who has met a Jew. This nihilism falls directly out of the doctrines around martyrdom and jihad, which are unique to Islam. Again, I'm not saying nationalism and ordinary grievances never play a role. They do. I'm talking about the religious layer of these conflicts that make them worse than other types of conflict...\n\nThis from The New York Times on February 12, 1984... Almost exactly 40 years ago. Reported by Terence Smith, who at the time was a former foreign correspondent and chief White House correspondent for The New York Times. Reading from the start of the article, about the war between Iran and Iraq. This is being reported from the Iranian side, about their routine use of child soldiers on suicide missions...\n\nThis madness has nothing to do with Israel. Here, we're talking about the war between Iran and Iraq, 40 years ago. These were Muslims fighting other Muslims. And it was a zombie movie. This belief in martyrdom is cancer for the mind. Until the Muslim world outgrows it -- anathematizes it, vomits over it, can't believe it ever indulged it -- the potential for the most insane violence will never go away. And this is why nuclear weapons in the hands of jihadists cannot be tolerated. As bad as nuclear proliferation is in every other context -- just think of how bonkers things are with North Korea. North Korea has nuclear weapons. And they have also built ICBMs. Though their accuracy is still debatable. And they have threatened to bomb the United States. As bad as that is, one thing makes it tolerable: We don't believe that Kim Jong Un is eager to die. The guy loves basketball. He has 100 cars and a harem and a private island. If a fanatical belief in martyrdom were endemic to North Korea and its leaders, that would make the situation incalculably worse. The entire world, and the Muslim world in particular, needs to recognize that jihadism is the one ism that can no longer be tolerated.\n\nAs for genocide, the intentions of Hamas, as declared in their founding charter, and as they have reiterated numerous times since October 7th, are explicit: They aspire to commit an actual genocide. This is something they proudly claim to want to do. And the worst part is that they don't ultimately care about their own survival. Members of Hamas, like jihadists everywhere, routinely chant, \"We love death more than the Jews, or the infidels, or the Americans, love life.\" While this might sound like posturing, and it may be posturing for any specific person who lacks real faith, in general, it is an honest expression of their religious worldview. They are a death cult. And Hamas is a death cult that happens to be very popular among Palestinians. Even though Hamas has engineered a situation in which to fight them effectively requires that Palestinian civilians also die.\n\nAgain, they are consciously using their own population as human shields. They have built hundreds of miles of tunnels under Gaza, more extensive than the London underground, with thousands of entrances that use hospitals, mosques, schools, apartment buildings, and other civilian infrastructure as cover. Hamas fighters are hiding in these tunnels right now, and using the innocent civilians they kidnapped from Israel as an additional layer of human shields. Crucially, these tunnels are not being used as bomb shelters for the civilian population. On the contrary, the civilian population is being sacrificed to protect the tunnels. Again, that was the whole plan. They have spent billions of dollars, over the course of 17 years, building these tunnels. The Palestinians in Gaza have received more international aid than almost any community on earth. They could have built a Singapore on the Mediterranean. In fact, if they were pacifists, they would already have a state. Pacifism would actually work if practiced by the Palestinians against Israel. There is no way that Israel could resist a Gandhian-style campaign of nonviolence in support of a 2-state solution. The Palestinians would absolutely win a moral contest like that, and could have won it 50 years ago. But, generally speaking, they are a culture of religious fanatics, ruled by absolute fanatics, who are willing to sacrifice everything for martyrdom. As a top Hamas official said in response to all the destruction in Gaza, \"We are called a nation of martyrs. And we are proud to sacrifice martyrs.\" That is the problem that Israel is dealing with. What Hamas is doing is not, in any sense, normal human behavior in a time of a war. But it is normal for jihadists. What Israel is doing, in a desperate attempt to eradicate Hamas, while minimizing civilian death, is not in any sense an act of genocide...\n\nAnyone calling for a cease fire at this point needs to ask themselves, why aren't you calling for Hamas to release the hostages? And why don't you remember that there was a ceasefire on October 6th? The truth that we cannot lose sight of is that Hamas has deliberately engineered the chaos on both sides of the Gaza border.\n\nMyth #2: International Humanitarian Law Requires that Israel's response to Palestinian aggression be \"proportional.\"\n\nThe term \"proportional\" is being widely misunderstood when talking about the war in Gaza. To be truly \"proportional,\" in the way that many people imagine this word is used, Israeli soldiers would need to rape, torture, and murder the same number Palestinian noncombatants as Hamas raped, tortured, and murdered in Israel on October 7th. But, of course, no one believes that such reciprocal savagery would constitute a sane or ethical response to Hamas's violence.\n\nIn fact, the concept of \"proportionality\" doesn't refer to the numbers of casualties on either side of a conflict, much less insist that they be equal. It simply asks that we weigh the military importance of an action against the resulting destruction of civilian life and property. International law allows Israel to utterly destroy Hamas, given what happened on October 7th, and given the fact that they continue to fire rockets into Israeli cities, intentionally targeting civilians. As I've said, there is no way for Israel to fight Hamas without a massive loss of innocent life because, again, Hamas has embedded itself in the civilian population, on purpose, to cause as much civilian death as possible.\n\nJihadism aside, in this age of social media, it seems that many people are discovering for the first time what modern warfare is actually like. Independent of the rightness or wrongness of any cause, enormous numbers of innocent people die. The Allies killed hundreds of thousands of German civilians in World War II. And hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians along with them. How would that have looked on TikTok?\n\nMore recent wars are no exception. Around 2,300 US soldiers died in the war in Afghanistan. And yet we killed over 50,000 members of the Taliban and other opposing forces, and around 50,000 Afghan civilians died too. So there was around a 40 to 1 disparity in the number of deaths between the two sides. In the War in Iraq, we suffered twice the fatalities, around 4,600, and we caused something like 40,000 military deaths, so a 9 to 1 ratio, but there were somewhere around 200,000 civilians killed. Of course, many of those deaths were due to the sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shia in Iraq, for which we also get blamed. Accepting that blame yields a fatality ratio once again of over 40 to 1...\n\nIsrael is being held to a level of scrutiny in how it conducts this war that has never been applied to the United States, or the UK, or France, or any other country in a time of conflict. And unlike our wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, Israel's war against Hamas is genuinely existential. And again, they are fighting jihadists, who have built hundreds of miles of tunnels under a civilian population, for the purpose of maximizing the loss of civilian life. It's an impossible situation.\n\nOf course, the loss of civilian life in Gaza is absolutely tragic... But we can't lose sight of the fact that all this tragedy and horror has been consciously engineered by Hamas for reasons that make perfect sense to jihadists, but which no normal army has ever contemplated or would ever contemplate...\n\nThere is simply no good way to fight an enemy of this kind. When you are fighting jihadists, your own scruples -- the shame and horror you feel at killing noncombatants -- become another weapon in their hands. Jihadists are very clever. They know that by our own moral code, the images of innocent civilians being killed in Gaza are totally unacceptable. They know that we can only tolerate so much of that, lest we become unrecognizable to ourselves -- lest we become monsters. But these people are already monsters. Hamas simply does not care about Palestinian children, and they are committed to murdering Israeli children whenever they can. That is why they have to be destroyed. There are only terrible and more terrible options here. And, again, the problem is deeper than Israel and the Palestinians. Eventually Muslim societies need to understand that their religious beliefs -- specifically the doctrines about jihad and martyrdom -- make any conflict of this kind far more pointlessly horrible than it needs to be. That is their fault. And it will remain their fault no matter how many children die in Gaza...\n\nThe crucial distinction, which almost no one can keep in view, is that there are now two types of people in this world: those who intentionally torture and kill children and other noncombatants, to maximize horror, and those who seek to avoid doing so, however imperfectly, while defending themselves against the first sort of people. The gulf between these two groups could not be wider, and everything we care about -- literally everything -- exists on one side of it.\n\nMyth #3: The Jews Are Colonizers and the Palestinians are Indigenous People.\n\nThere has been a continuous presence of Jews in the land of Israel for thousands of years. The Jews, therefore, are an indigenous people of the region. They were also indigenous to Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Turkey, Iran, and other Muslim countries -- before being driven out of those countries by Muslims. (Curiously, no one at the U.N. is worried about the Jews so-called \"right of return.\" Is anyone pressuring Muslim countries to give Jews their homes back? No. These are the sorts of asymmetries one should notice.)\n\nIn any case, Israel is not unique among states in having been created by outside powers, just drawing lines on maps in the aftermath of WW2. Pakistan was born in the same year and in the same way, and yet no one questions its right to exist. Nearly every nation on Earth has emerged from a chaotic history of conquest and the displacement of people. There are now 22 official Muslim States and over 50 Muslim-majority countries. This is the result of centuries of Muslim conquest. There is exactly one Jewish state. And yet only Israel must continuously confront charges of its illegitimacy. Only Israel must continually advocate for its right to exist. There are nearly 200 member states of the UN, and Israel has been sanctioned by that body more than all the countries in the world combined. Does that mean that Israel has behaved especially badly? No. There are countries like North Korea that have turned its entire society into a prison camp. There are countries like Sudan, that have perpetrated actual genocides. There are counties like Egypt and Somalia, where nearly 100 percent of girls are subjected to genital mutilation. There are countries, like Syria, that have killed orders of magnitude more Muslim noncombatants. As I already pointed out, there are countries like Iran that have used child soldiers, by the tens of thousands, in suicide operations. And yet the UN sits in perpetual judgment of the one embattled democracy in the Middle East that is fighting for its actual survival -- against a death cult that revels in atrocities and in the martyrdom of its own civilians...\n\nMyth #4: The atrocities committed by Hamas (and over one thousand Palestinian civilians) on October 7th were a legitimate response to oppression.\n\nIsrael left Gaza in 2005 -- forcibly removing thousands of its own citizens -- and billions of dollars in international aid have since been spent there. So the \"oppression\" of the Palestinians in Gaza -- by Israel -- is at least debatable. While Israel has sought to maintain a secure border with Gaza all those years, so has Egypt -- and yet no one blames Egypt for making Gaza an \"open-air prison.\" However, even if we accept the charge of \"oppression,\" it must be said that not all oppressed people respond by raping, and torturing, and murdering noncombatants.\n\nThe Tibetans have been truly oppressed by the Chinese for many decades, and yet they have never committed atrocities against Chinese civilians. When the Jews of Germany were herded into ghettos by the Nazis, those who escaped didn't rape and mutilate German teenagers or burn German babies alive in reprisal. There are countless historical examples of real oppression, and yet very few cultures have produced a bottomless supply of suicidal terrorists. There might be many societal factors that explain these differences, but one is surely the Islamic doctrines around martyrdom and jihad. People's religious beliefs really are motivating. We can see this with fundamentalist Christianity in the West. The fundamentals of religion matter when you're a fundamentalist. And it matters that the fundamentals of our various religions are different. Mere religious tribalism is always a potential source of intolerance and violence -- it is much worse when there are specific doctrines that advocate intolerance and violence. Again, we need the world's 2 billion Muslims to honestly acknowledge this problem and find some way of moderating their faith, specifically around the doctrines of martyrdom, jihad, apostasy, and blasphemy-which put their faith in perpetual conflict with the modern world.\n\nMyth #5: The two sides in this conflict are equally civilized, equally entitled to respect, and equally worth protecting...\n\nJihadist organizations like Hamas, and the wider cultures that support them, don't value human life the way we do... There is a difference between religious fanatics who punish women with beatings (or worse) for showing their hair in public, or commit honor killings against them for the crime of getting raped, or throw acid in their faces for a perceived slight, or even, in a place like Afghanistan for the crime of going to school -- there is a difference between this vicious lunacy and a modern society that treats women as equals to men. There is a difference between a society that murders gays, that literally has a policy of throwing them off of rooftops head first, and one that fully embraces them. There is a difference between religious fanatics who care only about Paradise, and most other people who take their religious beliefs much less seriously -- or who have different beliefs that allow them to appropriately value life in this world.\n\nHave you seen the crowds that cheered the capture of Israeli hostages and the mutilation of Jewish dead? Have you watched those videos? Did these people look like they have the slightest interest in avoiding war crimes? These are the types of behaviors we see all around the world in an Islamic context, even when the fighting has nothing to do with Jews or the US...\n\nRecent polling among Palestinians, by the Palestinian Center for Policy Survey and Research, shows widespread support for Hamas, and more support for the attacks of October 7th. As I said, many of those who don't like Hamas, for one reason or another, still like what Hamas did on October 7th. This recent poll shows that while only around 40 percent of Palestinians support Hamas, double that support these atrocities of October 7th -- the deliberate torture and murder of noncombatants, the taking of children (and even infants) as hostages. And the justification, in their minds, is explicitly religious -- it was in defense of the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, which they imagine has been desecrated by the Netanyahu government. Of course, the Palestinian community and the Muslim world generally is so riddled with lies and conspiracy theories, that we might reasonably wonder what percentage of ordinary Muslims believe that any Jewish civilians were killed on October 7th. Many believe the Holocaust never happened. After September 11th, we had the impossible spectacle of Muslims alleging that it was Jewish plot, because 4000 Jews supposedly didn't show up to work on 9/11, while simultaneously celebrating it as a great jihadist victory by al-Qaeda. There is no reconciling these beliefs. In general, we are not talking about people who are part of the reality-based community. But if we are going to maintain basic moral sanity at this moment in history, we have to acknowledge that there is a difference between those who intentionally kill noncombatants -- often in the most gruesome ways possible -- and those who inadvertently kill them when dropping bombs, having taken considerable pains to avoid killing them. There is a difference between a society that parades tortured hostages before jeering crowds and one that gives even its most dangerous prisoners life-saving medical care. Most people don't realize that the current head of Hamas, Sinwar, was cured of brain cancer, while in an Israeli prison. The actual mastermind behind the October 7th attacks was someone whose life had been saved by Jewish oncologist. It's pretty hard to overstate the disparity here...\n\nIntentions matter. Actions matter, of course, but the reasons behind the actions also matter. What sort of world are we trying to build? What would any given person or group do if they had the power to do it? There are vast differences in what various groups are aspiring to accomplish at this moment in history\"",

        "title": "This week in history: February 19-25",
        "text": "facebook icon25 years ago: Turkey charges Abdullah \u00d6calan with treason\n\nOn February 23, 1999, the Turkish government charged Kurdish guerrilla leader Abdullah \u00d6calan with treason, one week after the Turkish National Intelligence Organization abducted him in Nairobi, Kenya. This followed a months-long international manhunt backed by virtually every European government.\n\nThe persecution and abduction of \u00d6calan marked a repudiation by governments around the world, first and foremost the US, of the fundamental democratic right of political asylum.\n\n\u00d6calan was expelled from Syria in October 1998, after the Assad regime relented to pressure from the US and Turkey. He then fled to Russia where he was denied political asylum. In November he attempted refuge in Rome, where the Italian government, headed by Massimo D'Alema, formerly a leader of the Italian Communist Party, rejected Turkish demands for his extradition, but refused to grant asylum. D'Alema worked behind the scenes for \u00d6calan's expulsion, and by mid-January 1999 he was forced out.\n\nFor several weeks \u00d6calan's whereabouts were the subject of intense speculation, as government after government refused to give him shelter. Germany, with a Social Democratic chancellor and a leader of the Green Party as foreign minister, and the largest Kurdish minority of any country on the European continent, would not let him in.\n\nThe PKK leader was denied admission to the Netherlands and Greece, while Italy and Denmark warned him they did not want him on their territory. On February 1, \u00d6calan's plane was allowed to touch down on the Greek island of Corfu, after arriving from \"neutral and democratic\" Switzerland.\n\nThe following day \u00d6calan tried to set down in Rotterdam, Holland, in order to appear before the International Court of Arbitration to plead the Kurdish cause. But he was prevented from doing so by the Dutch government, which declared him an \"undesirable alien.\"\n\nAs \u00d6calan's plane was reportedly heading for Greece, a spokesman for the \"socialist\" PASOK government in Athens said, \"Our policy is crystal clear. We do not desire \u00d6calan's presence in Greece.\"\n\nInstead the Greek government encouraged \u00d6calan to fly to Nairobi where he was hidden on Greek embassy premises. It was only a matter of time before various intelligence agencies coordinated with Kenyan and Greek officials and Turkish commandos to drag the Kurdish leader from the embassy and spirit him onto a plane to Turkey. The Turkish leader who presided over the abduction, Bulent Ecevit, was a veteran social democratic politician.\n\nAfter initially denying any \"direct\" involvement, US officials acknowledged a week later that Washington played the central role in hunting him down. American FBI agents detected \u00d6calan's presence at the Greek embassy in Nairobi within two days of his clandestine arrival on February 2. The FBI informed Turkey of the political refugee's whereabouts, setting in motion the chain of events that ended with seizure by Turkish security forces and his transfer, blindfolded and in chains, to an island prison near Istanbul.\n\n50 years ago: Israel returns control of Suez Canal to Egypt\n\nOn February 21, 1974, Israeli soldiers left the west bank of the Suez Canal following the end of the Yom Kippur War. According to the terms of the ceasefire agreement signed January 18, 1973, the entire Suez Canal would be returned to Egypt and all Israeli troops were to be withdrawn to an area deeper inside the Sinai Peninsula.\n\nThe canal had been closed for nearly seven years since Israel began its occupation of the Sinai peninsula during the 1967 Six Day War. Since then, in what is sometimes referred to as the \"War of Attrition,\" the Suez Canal area became a heavily militarized zone with Egyptian and Israeli forces engaging in occasional skirmishes, firing on one another from across the canal.\n\nThe stalemate was broken in October 1973, when a surprise joint offensive launched by Egypt and Syria delivered significant blows to the Israeli military defenses. Israeli forces would mount a counterattack that penetrated across the canal and laid siege to the city of Suez, destroying two thirds of buildings in the city.\n\nIsrael's counterattack was made possible only by a massive military rearmament by the United States. After the war began President Richard Nixon ordered the largest airlift in history to resupply Israel with tanks, ammunition and other military supplies.\n\nThe leading Arab nations organized in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) responded to the US and other imperialist nations' support for Israel with an embargo on oil exports to those countries. The embargo had massive economic ramifications throughout the world, causing already high rates of inflation to skyrocket.\n\nComing under immense domestic pressure to end the oil embargo, augmented in Britain by a nationwide coal strike, the imperialist countries were prepared to grant concessions to Egypt and the Arab coalition. Most importantly among these was abandoning their long-held hopes to snatch control of the Suez Canal away from Egypt.\n\nOnce the canal was back under Egyptian control it had to undergo intense engineering work to make it usable for shipping once again, including the clearing out of explosive mines that had been laid during the war. In June 1975 it would reopen and reconnect the shortest and most direct shipping route from Europe to the Arabian Peninsula, India and East Asia.\n\nThe return of the Suez Canal to Egypt set the stage for a further rapprochement with Israel. The formal end to the Yom Kippur War was the first step toward the Camp David Accords signed in 1979, when Egypt became the first Arab state to recognize the state of Israel as a legitimate government. In exchange for the full return of the entire Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, Sadat abandoned the struggle of Palestinians against the Israeli occupation.\n\n75 years ago: Union bureaucrats sell out strike by 11,000 Philadelphia transport workers\n\nOn February 20, 1949, union officials orchestrated the sellout of a 10-day strike by Philadelphia transport workers, in the face of substantial opposition from the rank-and-file. The stoppage, which involved more than 11,000 workers, had been met with a vicious campaign of denunciation in the capitalist press, while winning widespread sympathy from workers in the city and more broadly.\n\nThe strike was called by Local 234 of the CIO Transport Workers Union (TWU) against the Philadelphia Transportation Corporation, which was seeking to limit contract wage rises to a pittance, and to prevent any change to onerous working conditions. The stoppage involved workers across the city's street car, bus and subway networks, as well as taxi drivers, bringing most transportation to a halt.\n\nIn a February 16 article outlining the issues in the dispute, The Militant, publication of the Socialist Workers Party, then the American section of the world Trotskyist movement, stated: \"It may come as a shock to some people that American workers today should be forced to strike for such elementary demands as the 40-hour week, overtime pay for overtime worked, extra compensation for weekend work, not to mention decent wages. But it's true.\"\n\nThe corporation was seeking to maintain a system where workers were forced to clock on multiple times throughout the day to receive an eight-hour wage, compelling unpaid overtime. It was also trying to force through a three-cent wage increase, under conditions where workers were earning barely enough to keep up with the still substantial increases in prices. The workers countered with a demand for a 20 cent rise, together with basic rights, including overtime and penalty payments and modern labor conditions.\n\nThe TWU, together with the union leadership as a whole, isolated the stoppage, ensuring that it did not spread to other cities or encompass other sections of the working class.\n\nThe Militant reported that the company offer was forced through by skullduggery and intimidation on the part of the union officials. When the company offer was put, it was voted down 23-9 by the local executive board. National TWU President Michael Quill then called a membership meeting, at which the agreement was vociferously denounced by striking workers, who voted it down by a two-thirds majority.\n\nQuill \"recessed\" the meeting to the next afternoon. At that meeting, he and the local executive leadership steamrolled the agreement through. They restricted speakers against the sellout, called a secret ballot and declared the deal accepted and a return to work in order.\n\nThe brazen betrayal typified the role of the union bureaucrats. They had stymied and suppressed a massive movement of the American working class in the immediate postwar period, and by 1949 were determined to enforce full-scale industrial peace in keeping with their alignment with the Democratic Party administration and the striving of American imperialism for untrammeled global hegemony.\n\n100 years ago: Mussolini demands African territory from Britain\n\nOn February 22, 1924, the Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini sent a diplomatic note to the British Foreign Office demanding that Britain cede to Italy the region called Jubaland, on the northeastern edge of its Kenya colony, in what is now southern Somalia.\n\nThe note was prompted after the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Arthur Ponsonby, declared in the House of Commons that no settlement regarding Jubaland was possible unless Italy returned the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean off the coast of Turkey to Greece.\n\nItaly had occupied the Dodecanese after the Italo-Turkish War of 1912. The islands were an important staging area for Italian imperialism's colonial ambitions in southern Anatolia after the end of World War I and the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire. These plans were thwarted by the development of the Turkish nationalist movement led by Kemal Ataturk after 1919 and the expulsion of foreign troops from Turkey.\n\nSome British politicians sought to transfer the islands to Greece, a British ally (as Greece demanded), a goal accomplished only in 1947 after the Axis powers were defeated in World War II. In the case of the 1924 proposal by Ponsonby, this was soon smoothed over by the Labour government.\n\nItaly was anxious to hold its overseas possessions and continued to seek the spoils of the 1914-1918 imperialist war wherever it could. The award of Jubaland, which was adjacent to its territories in Italian Somaliland, had been a secret condition for it entering World War I on the side of the Allies in 1915. Italy had ruled \"Somalia Italiana\" as a unified colony since 1908 after years of military incursions. Its rule was particularly brutal: In 1911 it legalized slavery in the colony.\n\nBritain, eager to placate Italian imperialism, transferred Jubaland, including the port of Kismayo, to Italy in 1925. Italy soon after began to harass and undermine the adjacent independent state of Abyssinia (Ethiopia), which would result in the full-scale invasion of the country in 1936.\n\nContact usRelated TopicsFind out more about these topics:",

The April contract CLc2 rose 87 cents to $78.46.\n\nFor the week, Brent gained more than 1% and the U.S. benchmark rose about 3%.\n\nThe growing risk of a wider conflict in the Middle East supported crude prices.\n\nOn Thursday, Hezbollah said it fired dozens of rockets at a northern Israeli town in a \"preliminary response\" to the killing of 10 civilians in southern Lebanon, the deadliest day for Lebanese civilians in four months of cross-border hostilities.\n\nThe oil market's reaction to news from the Middle East was moderate, said Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS.\n\n\"The market sees oil still flowing and disruptions have been small,\" he said.\n\nGaza's largest functioning hospital was under siege in Israel's war with Islamist group Hamas, as warplanes struck Rafah, the last refuge for Palestinians in the enclave, officials said.\n\nThreats persisted in the Red Sea after a missile fired from Yemen struck an India-bound tanker carrying crude oil.\n\nU.S. producer prices increased more than expected in January amid strong gains in the costs of services, which could amplify inflation worries. Still,a slumpin retail sales prompted hopes the Fed will soon start cutting rates, which could support oil demand.\n\n\"Hopes for U.S. rate cuts provided support on Thursday, but investors are now adjusting their positions ahead of a long (holiday) weekend in the U.S.,\" said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, president of NS Trading, a unit of Nissan Securities.\n\nOn Thursday, the IEA said global oil demand growth was losing momentum and trimmed its 2024 growth forecast.\n\nThe agency expects global oil demand growth to decelerate to 1.22 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, about half of the growth seen last year, in part due to a sharp slowdown in Chinese consumption. It had previously forecast 2024 demand growth of 1.24 million bpd.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) expects oil use to keep rising for the next two decades.\n\nU.S. energy firms this week cut the number of oil and natural gas rigs in operation for the second time in three weeks, energy services firm Baker Hughes BKR.O said in its closely followed report on Friday.\n\nSource: Reuters (Additional reporting by Natalie Grover in London, Mohi Narayan in New Delhi and Yuka Obayashi in Tokyo; editing by Jonathan Oatis, Kirsten Donovan and David Gregorio)",

The damaged ship required international assistance after it caught fire when the missile struck its highly flammable payload.\n\nThe Houthi attacks on ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden in solidarity with the Palestinians fighting Israel have spurred the European Union to launch a full-scale naval mission to protect the vessels as they travel across the busy trade route connecting Europe and Asia.\n\nThe German government approved the deployment of forces Friday, noting that the navy ships will focus on protection as opposed to actively attacking the Houthis.\n\nThe US and the United Kingdom, in the meantime, have continued to launch a series of airstrikes in Yemen aimed at destroying the Houthis' terror facilities and weapon stockpiles.\n\nEarlier this month, US and UK officials said they hit at least 30 Houthi targets across 10 locations in Yemen.\n\nHouthi officials have reveled at the idea of fighting the US and other Israel allies, with members of the terror group and its supporters holding daily demonstrations in Yemen's capital to celebrate the attacks and to call on Israel to withdraw from Gaza.",

The strikes come amid heightened tensions in the region, where Houthi fighters have carried out attacks on commercial and military shipping since November. The Houthis initially said that they would target Israel-linked ships in a show of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, but later expanded their targets to include vessels linked to the United Kingdom and the US.\n\nLondon and Washington have responded by hitting Houthi targets in Yemen multiple times, characterising the Houthi attacks as indiscriminate and a threat to global trade. On Saturday, the Houthis claimed responsibility for a missile attack on a British oil tanker that the US identified as a Panamanian-flagged vessel carrying crude oil bound for India.\n\nFaced with mounting Red Sea insecurity, major shipping lines have largely abandoned the critical trade route for longer routes around Africa. This has increased costs, feeding worries about global inflation while sapping Egypt of crucial foreign revenue from shippers using the Suez Canal to or from the Red Sea.",

        "text": "For Marx, shame is a revolutionary feeling. Perhaps that explains its scarcity in Western civilization, whose Orwellian and anti-revolutionary character has been exposed once again by its indifference to the heaps of dead babies scattered in Gaza, by the valiant effort of the South African state calling its humanitarian bluff in ICJ and not to forget the resistance of devastated, destroyed, and war-torn Houthis. Both the people of Palestine and the Ansarul Islam (Houthis) have nothing to lose but their chains but why have the people and the government of South Africa opted to jump into the imperialist inferno that can scald the country's body politics for it can invite the wrath of the dominant power addicted to impose all kinds of sanctions or managing a coup through its infamous secret arm the CIA?\n\nStrangely, South Africa is not a Muslim country, and unlike the entire Muslim Umah - subdued by its vested interests, hence opting to remain indifferent to the carnage- was under no moral obligation to sue the genocidal entity of Israel. It isn't even Cuba, a socialist state whose hardcore Marxist belief in the liberation of all oppressed people brought her to fight a battle against the white apartheid South African armed forces that ended in the comprehensive defeat of the US-backed apartheid regime and led to the liberation of South Africa, Angola, and Namibia.\n\n\"Until the liberation of Palestine,\" Nelson Mandela stated, \"our independence will be incomplete\". For it was Palestine, Libya under Gaddafi, and communist Cuba that supported, financed, and fought in that order to liberate South Africa from the white mercenaries backed by the entire civilized West, plagued by the affliction of racism and capitalism.\n\nThe absolute victory of the South African government, in the International Court thus far appears to be pyrrhic\n\nBesides the rich resources of many other minerals, South Africa and the Soviet Union were the only two countries in the world that possessed the largest reserves of gold. One of the reasons that forced the Nixon administration to break the US dollar parity with gold. It wasn't South Africa alone that suffered genocide. Genocide has always been the policy of Western expansionism. The US destroyed the native population without guilt and with nonchalant ease. The settler colonial whites of Canada and Australia hunted the natives gleefully as animals. Leaving Bolivia aside, most of the Latin American countries have dispensed with the native population, which can be scarcely seen alive if seen at all.\n\nEven in 1943, Indian Bengal was not spared, where under Churchill's malignant racial gaze the human-made famine took nearly 3 to 6 million lives. No wonder the Indian bourgeoisie which is building the statues of Savarkar would not hesitate to build a monument of the imperial thug whose imperialist government accepted Savarkar's apology.\n\nComing back to the valiant act of South Africa of taking the genocidal regime of Israel to the International Court of Justice (ICG) in the Hague is an unprecedented act of solidarity with the people of Palestine, left alone out in the cold to face the US-Western-Israeli genocide. And for what, merely to demand their UN-recognized right of statehood, to live with dignity in a free, fair society governed by their elected representatives?\n\nFor South Africa, the heroic effort was based on its undaunted spirit of self-sacrifice. There was no possibility of quid pro quo because the people of Palestine, being victims of genocide, could not offer anything in return to their South African brothers. The eighty-four-page charge sheet presented to the ICG by the South African was an impeccable and concise document, as described by Norman Finkelstein. The young Irish lawyer who spoke in French was the most impressive among the lot. The South African side resisted the temptation of showing the hideous videos of human slaughter committed by the IDF. The only video they presented to the ICJ was of the IDF soldiers dancing and merrymaking around the cadavers of the innocent civilian Palestinian victims, slain by the \"most civilized army\" in the world. They were singing abhorrent songs of eliminating the entire population of Amalek, their babies, and their cattle. This time, the Amalek were not Jews but the Palestinians. \"Only a humanity to whom death has become as indifferent as its members, that has itself died,\" Adorno says, \"can inflict it administratively on innumerable people\".\n\nThe video shown by the South African lawyers takes one's memory back to the Nazi era. Under Hitler's regime, the entire population of Germany behaved similarly, proving that it was not Hitler alone, but the entire German population was suffering from anti-Jewish, anti-communist, and anti-Roma paranoia. However, there is a difference between the two societies. Adorno says the Germans thought \"the Fuhrer does not know about (the gory) things when concentration camps were concerned\". But in Israel, Netanyahu knows everything and screams vociferously to liquidate the Palestinians while thumping his chest.\n\nSince the ICJ has conformed to the plausible act of genocide perpetrated by Israel asking it to restore food and health facilities and to withhold the carnage without using the term ceasefire. ICJ has upheld the rule of law but not the ruled-based order, a term coined by the US and its lackeys, meaning to obey the US unconditionally. Flouting ICJ's decision brazenly, Israel continues to excel in its carnage without allowing access to food and health facilities to the Gazans. The absolute victory of the South African government, in the International Court thus far appears to be pyrrhic. However, in the longer run, it will probably set several nations into action and may have far-reaching consequences for the Zionist entity.\n\nFor now, Israel, the US, and its settler colonial poodles have stopped giving aid to UNWRA, on frivolous charges. UNWRA was responsible for providing food, health, and education to the Palestinians. Formed in 1950 for Palestinians alone, UNWRA was always a thorn in Israeli eyes. As the ICJ took the decision, the Israeli regime got the opportunity to blame it for something - the alleged unproven collaboration of its four members with Hamas - that Zionists could not find in four months of this carnage but now have suddenly come to discover.\n\nThe court's verdict will be discussed in the Security Council, the elite club, which has nothing to do with human security. Everyone knows about the outcome of this Shakespearean tragic drama, where the king shamelessly stands nude with his veto power to kill the verdict. But in the General Assembly, it will be another matter. A large majority that voted in favour of Palestine can decide to recognize the state of Palestine officially. These states can impose sanctions upon Israel individually and collectively. They can stop buying and selling from it. The verdict against Israel committing a plausible act of genocidal is binding on all nations and people. It will be the test of the nations, the UN itself, and international law simultaneously.\n\nBut there is a rub, nothing can be expected of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Morocco, Egypt, and most of the other oil-producing Muslim countries. It will be interesting to see the response of China and Russia each allegedly committing some form of human rights violations in Xinjiang and Ukraine. Though both have not the remotest equivalence with what is happening in Palestine. The global South's struggle against the global North is real, but the global South is not homogenous. It has many countries that are weighing their options and are ready to play on either side. India is one of them, which has not only deep military ties with Israel, but it shares hatred against the Muslims with the apartheid state. The \"shining\" state is exporting its cheap labour to replace the Palestinians.",
